We did it! Yes! - I suppose summer had to end sometime. It's sad, though, because I had a great summer. I got West Nile virus. Lost a ton of weight. Then I went back to the Lake. I stepped on a piece of glass in the parking lot, Which hurt. That got infected, even though I peed on it. - Saw inception. Or at least I dreamt I did. - Broccoli Rob, obviously, Will be there. - Yes, of course. - And j.C. We call him Blorville Because he looks like a black Orville Redenbacher. - Who's the guy who invented the peanut? - Hey, guys. - Hey! - Sorry, didn't mean to interrupt. - Not at all. - I'm gonna head back To Siberia there. - Aw. - Ciao. I started dating Erin this summer. It has been, in a word, exquisite. - Gabe is awesome. He has accomplished so much career-wise and height-wise. Thank God he's my boss because I would not have said yes to a first date If I didn't have to. ButIt's been great. - Am I angry that Gabe stole my girlfriend Over the summer? No. I've been through anger management, okay? So right now I am sitting on a nice beach at Cape Cod, Gazing out across the whitecaps. Oh, look, it's a humpback whale. How pretty. He's eating Gabe. - Hey. What are you doing? - From now on, if you're hot, sit on an ice pack. - Well, what if you're cold? - Pbbbt! Like you'd ever be cold, Kevin. Stop asking me hypothetical questions. I'm too busy. - Hey, Dwight, I don't know if you heard, But we're supposed to be drinking out of weird backpacks Instead of cups, like regular people. Oh, you did hear. - Jim, you have one job to do, And you do it forgettably. Those of us who are busy require hands-free hydration. Dwight Schrute, star salesman, beet farmer. Bed and breakfast proprietor. Aspiring freelance bodyguard. Add to that list owner of this building. Then burn the list. - This summer I did the minority Executive training program at Yale. You guys, I'm, like, really smart now. You don't even know. You could ask me, "Kelly, what's the biggest company in the world?" And I'd be, like, "blah blah blah, Blah blah blah blah blah blah," Giving you the exact right answer. - Coffee monkey's arrived. - The coffee was supposed to be here at 9:00. - Here you go, big "o." Tiny Darryl Hannah. - It says "decaf." you get me decaf? - Ooh, yeah. Must have been some sort of mix-up there. You could just drink it, Or should I drive all the way back? - Well, summer, I, um, Blew out my knee playing softball. Ended up watching CNN most of the time. I don't know how we're gonna get out of Afghanistan. - The new guy sucks. Calls me "the nard man." I'm the "nard dog," okay? Nard man is my father. - My name is Luke Cooper. I love cinema. My favorite movies are citizen Kane And the boondock saints. - That kid is the worst. Needs to be fired, Michael. - He's not the worst. Okay? He's not the worst. You know who's the worst? That intern we had a few years ago. That guy remember? Eehhhhh! That face, how ugly he was? He was the worst. Good worker, though. Mm aw, it's not cappuccino. - He messed yours up to. - He's got to go, Mike. - It's just coffee, guys. But yeah, I'll look into it, okay? - Wow, that's a lot of keys. - The bigger the key chain, the more powerful the man. - That's right. The janitor said that. By the way, the raccoons are back. - Where? - I think they run through these panels And then down under the map. I wouldn't know for sure 'cause I don't have a trained ear. That's why I have to use one of these. - Gimme that. - Yep. Wait. And this. - Yes. - Go get 'em. What happened to me this summer? Dwight bought the building, so actually, this has been The busiest summer of my life. - Hey, what's so funny over here? Ha, very nice. Give me my keys. NotFunnyJim! - Sorry. - Oh, no. Don't worry about it. I'm just gonna put a couple keys on every day Until Christmas. Then his pants would have fallen down, which was A little gift to me, but - It was really funny. - Well, it would have been. So unprofessional, Mrs. Halpert. - I love you. - Luke Luke! - What's up, Venus? - Did you send those samples to Justin At Lehigh motors yesterday? Because he didn't get 'em. - Uh, if you asked me to do it, I'm sure I did it. Yeah, strawberries are ripe. - Hey Turn off the chumbawamba and scram, twerp. - You don't have to yell. - Okay, rude. Luke I want you to go to the supermarket for me. - What for? - To get some ice cream for everybody. It's national ice cream afternoon. Great. And another thing I did this summer. I hired my nephew. - Having Luke here is a pretty big deal for me. Because his mother, Who also happens to be my half sister Kind of cut me off from that side of the family The last time I saw Luke Was the opening day of ace Ventura II, And that was '95. So, yes, 15 years on the dot. Anyway, I lost him in a forest. Don't bother Luke. - Why is there a circle with a line through it? - That means don't. Haven't you seen ghostbusters, Pam? - Yeah, but it's like you're saying we should bother Luke. - No, it Yes, okay. Right. All right, yep. My bad. I got it. Here we go. - Don't don't bother Luke. Got it. Come on. Okay. Um That's as clear as I can make it. - Hey, why can't we bother Luke? He deserves it. - Because I don't want it getting back to sabre That we're yelling at assistants. I think it would reflect poorly on us. - Who's gonna tell on us? Gabe? - That'd be hilarious. Uh, "Joe, they're creating a hostile work environment. Stop 'em." - Nope, it won't be Gabe, But actually, there is somebody in the office Who is very, very close to Luke. - How close? - Well, Dwight, he wiped his butt. Is that close enough for you? - Yes. Of course. - Guys, I think Michael and Luke are related. - No. No, Toby. He's not. Yes, he is. He's my nephew. - What? - Ohh! - Luke is my nephew. - Michael, that's nepotism. Luke is getting special treatment Because he's your nephew. - Yes, exactly. That is a very nice way of putting it, Oscar. Mixing family and business is a beautiful thing. - What's wrong with a level playing field? - Do think they should have had open auditions For the band Hanson? What if no one named Hanson showed up? That wouldn't even make sense. Or what if they just hired the littlest kid And a 50-year-old guy who was a murderer? Really safe. - Oh, man, so many points being made. - I couldn't care less about nepotism. But I'm loving the debate. Great minds battling it out. And I've got a front row seat. - God, when he needed help on earth, Who did he hire? Jesus Christ, his son. - That's a really tight argument. - Thank you. - Yeah. - But you're comparing you and Luke to God and Jesus. - No! No. I'm just saying, why does God Get to do something that I don't? - This is hypothetical. We're talking about Luke, who happens to be terrible. - Well, then, why aren't you bugging me To fire everybody who's bad? You just want me to fire Luke. That's reverse nepotism. He should not be punished because he is related to me And bad at what he does! - I would just like to say something Off of what Darryl said about the level playing field. That is actually a zoning issue. So thank you. - If there's nothing wrong with this, Michael, Why have you been keeping it a secret? - Because I wanted you to come to me and say, "wow, he is so great." And I was gonna say, "well, it's in the genes." And I was actually gonna be wearing jeans. And I'd point to them right? No. But you ruined it. SoThank you very much. Here he comes. Guys, look. I don't want you to treat him Like anyone else in the office. I just want you to treat him like my nephew. Hey, there he is! - Hey! Ice cream afternoon! - Whoo Whoo Whoo! - Whoo! - Wait Soy ice cream? Did you get real ice cream? - Or enough for everyone? - No, man. There was no list. UhBut I got bagel chips. - Ah, my favorite part of an ice cream party. The bagel chips. - Clutch cream run, bro. - Get whatever you want. On me. - You really think you can make it up to me with food? - I don't know. That usually works. I feel horrible for blowing Jim's prank. I don't know if you can tell, but he's mildly upset. And Dwight hasn't been messed with in a while, So he's become a monster. I need to make this right. - I came down here to feed the feral cats Like I usually do, And I found something unsavory In the back of your nephew's car. - Okay, you know what? Just just back off. Back off! - Well, take a look. It's all the packages he was supposed to overnight. He never bothered to send them. - All right, those might be his. He might own an ebay store. - Yep. That's exactly what my first thought was. And then I remembered having a conversation with him Where he was like, "I don't own an ebay store." So - Okay, okay. You know what? This is disgusting. This is like a witch hunt. This is like the Blair witch hunt project. - Oh, sure, those are the expense reports That corporate was waiting for yesterday. - Let's just make this kid open this damn car. - Oh, my gosh, those are the pants He wanted to return to talbots. - I'm reconsidering sending him back anyway. - You get that kid to open this car, Or I'm gonna do it myself by calling AAA. - Wait a minute. - I'm in! - Don't all right. Well, okay. You've just committed a felony. - Yep, here they are. - Yep, I just lost a client 'cause I swore I sent these samples on time. - This kid's costing us sales, Michael. - I'm sorry, do you want to try them on again to see - No, I know they fit. It's not about the fit. - Why is this my problem, Michael? - Because Gabe tattled. I was perfectly happy To just hide it from you. - Those overnight packages needed to go out, And Michael refuses to hold the guilty party accountable. - Lower yourself, Gabe. I don't wanna be having a conversation with your crotch. Okay, now educate me why you won't fire the boy. - You don't have all the facts. - Which are? - I love him. - Oh, God. How far has it gone? - No. No. He's my nephew. - Well, I got a nephew too. But he don't work for me. You know why? 'cause he's a screw-up. He can swim in my pool, but he can't come in my house. - Well, this office is my pool. And my house is my house. And I just want my nephew to work In my pool. - If you keep him, Michael, I'm gonna hold you accountable for him. You're on the hook for this kid. You got that? - Mm-hmm. - Cover his ass like tidy whities. - I will cover his ass like moss on Mississippi tree stump. - Was how I put it on clear enough? I mean, you had to go and make up your own saying? Deal with it, boys. - Luke and I have been working side by side As master and commander. Me as master, he as commander. Occasionally, he'll need a little push. And I will do that, and he'll slow down, And then I'll push him again. That's the thing with kids. You have to keep pushing. You have to push them until they push you back. And then you push some more. It's all about give and take, But mostly it's about pushing each other. - Oh, yeah. This will be easy. So just, like, rearrange the buttons and stuff. - Yeah, yeah. Like when he presses "door closed," The doors open. Or he presses "lobby," it goes to third floor. Stuff like that. Can you do that? - Yeah. Let me take a look at the circus board. - Dwight is about to get so pammed. - Hey, did you sms text message me? - Yeah, I wanted to show you something in the lobby. Uh, come on. - Okay, that's weird. - Hmm. - Just hitting "door closed." what? - There we go. - Well - Uh - is this elevator going up? - Mm-hmm. - HeyThe elevator is disobeying us! Ohh-Kay. Okay. We are stuck. We are stuck. - Um - Hank! Hank! Can you hear us? Oh, my God. Okay. Emergency protocol. - Oh - Just calm down. - Pam, try and pry open those front doors, immediately. - I don't - use your talons! Pry 'em open! Okay, DWI oh, my God! - Well, don't look, freak! - Dwight, what are you doing?! - Well - We've only been in here for, like, two seconds! - I got 56 ounces of fluid in my bladder! And we have to establish a pee corner. - You've gotta be kidding me. - Luke, is going to use his laser pointer To point to account setup. You click on that first, Then a whole new not no, no, no. Luke, come on. Come on. Not on Oscar's head. - Tsh. - All right. Luke, come on. Stop it. - What? I'm stopping it. That's what you said. - Give me the pointer. - So you just want me to move it. You're being totally unclear here. I'm just gonna go ahead and move it. - No, just power it down. No, no, no, no, no. Not on Angela's boob. Come on. Come on. Luke, seriously. - All right, fine, fine. I'll just go. - Okay. - I'm gone. - All right. Okay. Good job. Okay, email accounts. So we're starting with account setup. - Oh, my God, is it in my eyeball? - Yes. - I think he's burning my eye. - Michael, do something. - Sack up, man. - Okay, can I have that? - No. - Okay, I am going to count down from five. Five Four. - I'm not kidding. Three. Two. One. - Give okay. - All right, give it up. - No! YouAre going to learn to be more professional, Luke! - What the - That's what you're going to do, Luke! - Aah! What the hell was that? - I had to do that. - Hey, fuck this! Screw it! - All right. Are we good? - You're okay. He's okay. There are many different schools of thought On capital punishment. - That was awesome. - Texas justice. - Yeah, your nephew is so lame. - He's been trashing us relentlessly on Twitter. Yeah, it's funny stuff, but mean. - You follow him on Twitter? - Everywhere I look, it's Betty white this And Betty white that. Finally, a kid who's not talking about Betty white. Of course I follow him. - Michael You just physically assaulted an employee. Can we talk in private? Yes, of course. What is this in reference to? - Pam? - Oh, hey, Jim. Some prankster switched the elevator buttons on Dwight. - I did not do this. - I know. Yeah, and it was going really great at first. I got video. - This is impressive. - Well, you know They don't call me The Bart Simpson of Scranton for nothing. - Do they call you that? - They do call me that. - Come on, give me your hand. I'll help you down. - Nope. Scared of getting cut in half. Also, there's pee on the floor. - Oh! Course there is. Hey, Chinese tonight? - Yeah. - Great. - How ya doin'? - Pretty good. You must be almost out of water. - Stop drinking the water! Stop! - Yeah. - Oh! - You - No, no, no, no. It's the other hand, right hand. - Right hand? - Yeah. - Would have been nice to work with my family. It would have been nice If Luke had been able to stay here. But he couldn't. These things seldom work out. I don't know how Ringling brothers do it. Night after night, town after town, All across America. You would think they'd be sick of each other by now. But, clearly, They make it work. And my hat's off to them. - Argh! - Whoa! Whoa! Hey. Whoa. - You - hey - Dwight - Dwight - Stop! - Legal says the best way to protect us from a lawsuit Is to call this a stress-induced outburst. - You will have to undergo six sessions of counseling. - That's it? Really? That's nothing. All right. That's highway robbery. Good. Well, thats the spirit. I can do that. And you will do your counseling right here because Okay. Wait, what? Yeah, I'm really looking forward to work with you, Michael. Is there another option? Don't try to do this termination. Michael?   Late every day this week. We signed Ceecee for the staycare, it's on the other side of town. The traffic - Why didn't I think of this before? Did you know that there is a daycare center Opening right here in this building? Is there really? Now that I own the building, I'm looking for new sources of revenue. And a daycare center? Well, I guess it's not an evil idea, It's just a regular idea, but there's no Good laugh for a regular idea. Welcome to the sesame Avenue daycare center For infants and toddlers. You remember my cousin Mose? Welcome, children. - Were you painting in the dark? - Wait, is this your place, Dwight? - Oh, no, no, I like to think of it as the kids' place. Would you like a tour? - I don't think we really need Oh, let's take the tour, Pam. - Yeah. - Come on. Here is the language skills And cognitive development area. These are English, uh, letters. I see you found our magical toy box, Jim. - These are actually forks and knives from the break room. - Jim, to you and me, maybe. But, come on. To a child's imagination that's mister fork, And lieutenant knife, and miss fork. And a soy sauce packet. That shouldn't have been in there. I'm embarrassed. Don't beat yourself up. - We come fully equipped with a restroom, Feeding trough, play bucket, And room for a plant, in success. - Who will be watching the children? - No one. The door locks from the outside. Escape is impossible. Prove it. - WhatNo. - We're gonna head outside. Just give it a whirl. I just wanna see how it works. - Oh, no, no, no I - but I'll tell you this. If this works out, I think we're looking real good. - I promise you, that door locks. - What's something you did that This is the worst! You are the worst. I hate looking at your face. I wanna smash it! Okay, you know what? I made a mistake. I committed corporate punishment. My bad. It's over, it's done. But, my punishment is, um, Worse than hell. - Michael's been assigned six hours of mandatory counseling With a trained professional. I actually have a degree in social work. I mean, I know a lot of people Would just ask a few standard questions And tick off a few boxes, But I've got a chance to do some good here. I know what you wanna ask me. "did your mom ever see you naked?" - We can do this with more privacy. So you can molest me? Oh, okay. I don't think so. We're gonna leave the blinds open, So everybody can see What a big failure you are. That's the key. Boycott the steamtown mall! Everyone, you heard me. Cancel all your business with the steamtown mall! - The mall itself, or the stores in the mall? All of it! The mall, the stores, the kiosks. America's one big mall. Did something happen, Dwight? - Yeah, something happened. Oh, yeah. Something happened, Jim. Well, tell us what it is. I mean, it might help to get some context So we can get on board. You don't wanna know. - I'd like you to imagine a place Where you feel very peaceful. For me, it's the walk from the yogurt shop To my car, after I drop My daughter off on Sunday afternoons. - I I'm glad Michael's getting help. He has a lot of issues, and he's stupid. Look, I'm not gonna tell you That we have lower prices. Is price something that is important to you? Okay, well, let me know if anything changes. Pam? I can't do this. I don't have this sales gene or whatever it is. Tell me everything's gonna be okay. Everything's gonna be okay. Tell me I'm good at sales. - You're good you're good at sales. - The unfair thing about working in sales Is that your salary is almost all commission. So if you suck at sales, You make almost no money. I guess that's fair. - Dwight. - What? - Did you call all my clients at the mall And cancel all my business While using the "f" word? Yes, I did. And I'm gonna do the same with all of your clients. No, you will not. - Oh, yes, I will. That mall is corrupt. Okay, they're appearancist! - Okay, Dwight, we can't do that. So why don't you just tell us what happened? - Yeah. What happened, Dwight? Okay? - You guys know me, you know that I'm Not one for fancy things. But there was this one thing. It was in a fancy store, And it caught the corner of my eye When I took Mose down to the mall To get his blood pressure at the rite aid. And I thought, you know, Maybe I deserve this. You know, I had a great crop yield this fall. So what happened? - I went to the store and I pressed the buzzer, And they looked right at me, and then they looked away. And then I pressed the buzzer again, And they started taking pictures of me With their mobile phones. I guess I'm not the kind of guy that's good enough For precious heirlooms. You know what, Dwight? You need to go back there, and you need to Pretty woman their asses. We should start our own mall. Yeah! Wait, wait, wait. Actually, that's a really good idea, Kelly. What did I say? I talk a lot, so I've learned to just tune myself out. Dwight, how about this? Instead of a boycott, You and I, together, go down to that store And we teach those snobs a lesson. No, you and IAnd I. I'm gonna come with you. - Okay. - Good. All right. - Did you assume that I would automatically side With the rich, snobby shop owner? How about now? How about now? How about now? How about now? - Uh, what's your favorite flavor of - One hour. - What? - One hour. We've done one hour. Let's just speed this up. Okay, keep it moving. I wanna do all six hours today. - Okay, I can't count the hour if you don't talk. No, no, noNo. I know my rights, all I had to do Is sit here for six hours. Do my time. - Michael, it's up to me to check off the boxes, And I can't do that unless I honestly - Do you have any idea how angry that is making me? Tell me. I think we might be about to maybe really get somewhere. - Yes, I will. I will talk all right. Be careful what you wish for, Toby. Apparently theres a famous Hollywood movie From the 1980s beautiful girl. Pretty woman. - Um, apparently - Pretty woman. - It's one of the best revenge stories of all time, In which this sex worker, who is the protagonist That can't be right. Andy, how does it - no, no, no. - What? - I wanna hear you tell it. - Okay, um, the sex worker is denied service At a fancy store because she does not look wealthy. She later returns, dressed in all the trappings Of extravagant wealth, but instead of shopping - Julia Roberts goes in the store, and she's like, "I was in here yesterday, and you people wouldn't help me." And the shopgirl goes, "oh." And then Julia Roberts goes, "you girls work on commission, right?" And the girl's like, "yeah." And Julia Roberts goes "big mistake. Huge." - I was telling I was telling that. - How many paper supplies and ink cartridges to go with that? Okay, sure. - Who can I speak to in this office About saving on window treatments? I don't know. - Is one of you the office administrator? I. I'm the office administrator! Can I show you a few samples? Uh, we're not interested. We're not interested at all. There are a few ways to get promoted. One is to wait for an opening and apply for it. That's the main way. But this could work. - Toby, can I really tell you anything? Of course. Well, the other night, When I was sitting at the table, Eating my penis I mean peas. That was weird. - All right. - That's weird. I think it all stems From the fact that I was I was probed. By an alien life force. An a.L.F. Alf. You know, I might have actually Been probed by Alf. You might think he's a puppet, You never see the lower half, But there's a lower half. Office administrator. So when did this happen? A few months ago. I was talking to someone at corporate. - Mm-hmm. - Who isn't there anymore. And I think the paperwork just got lost in the shuffle. Can you believe that? - TypicalYeah, totally. Well, congrats. Thanks, yeah. So I'm I'm just gonna take care of stuff around the office And get paid a reasonable salary. We need that, right? - Totally, that's great. - I get paid $40,000 a year. - Great. - Maybe $50,000. - $50,000! No, not $50,000. $41,000, I think. - $41,000. - $41,500. That's great. - Before me stands your coworker, Dwight Kurt Schrute. Dwight, show them all sides, turn around. Now, today we need your help turning Dwight into a gentleman. - A gentleman, who is a rich snob. Who will go into shopping malls And drop huge amounts of cash on clothes. - Is he still doing his boycott? - No, no, this is instead of the boycott. Yeah. - Your shirt and tie are disgusto-barfo. - Agreed. - Really? - Maybe something not so monochromatic. Not so matching. - Wait, less matching to appear more rich? The glasses are a little I liked them. - I thought they were kind of cute. - Yeah, I liked them too. - I can't see. - Say stuff like, "good morning, good afternoon." People appreciate that. - Wait, I see you every day. Can I say, "good month?" - I'm telling you how to do this, man. - If someone offers you a cocktail, Accept, but keep your wits about you. Okay. - Please and thank you go a long way. - Copy. Thank you. Thank you. Please. I think he's got it. And I was raised by wolves. I was 25 years old before I saw my first human being. Wait, is it a full moon tonight? - Come on, Michael. These are all fake stories. - Yes, yes, they are all fake stories. What sort of twisted mind Would come up with weird stories like that? Three hours, we're halfway done. How? Hey, do you have a second? - Yeah. - Well, as I'm sure you know, For the past few months, I've been the office administrator, Since right before you guys took over. Right, of course. And I haven't goen paid yet. I'm not blaming you. Thank you so much. - I just think somebody lost the paperwork. Oh, boy. Can you get every department head's signature on this, So I can back this up to corporate? Yes, absolutely, right away. You know what, Michael? You're right. You win. This is pointless. We're not getting anywhere. I got a bunch of fun stuff, In case my daughter ever comes over. Why don't we just run out the clock By playing games, drawing some pictures, talking? - We present to you, for your final comments And approval, Dwight k. Schrute. Go get 'em, Dwight. Wish us luck. Thank you. Dwight. Ooh, all done. Disposable cameras are fun, although it does seem wasteful And you don't ever get to see your pictures. If it's an important event that you want to remember, I recommend using a real camera. But I don't care if I forget today. - We could play something more complicated if you'd like. This is plenty complicated. So you've played it before? - I played it once or twice with Jeff. Who's Jeff? - Jeff was my mother's boyfriend, Who she married. - So her husband and your stepdad. Yeah. Yeah, I guess I never thought of it that way, though. - Did you guys do much stuff together? Yeah, you know what, He took me to a baseball game once, I remember. It was weird, though; They took the pitcher Out of the game, and I felt really bad Because the pitcher wasn't going to be able to play With his friends anymore. But Jeff said that the manager was making a really good move By taking the pitcher out. He really respected the manager. It's working. I'm doing it. Ahem. - What? - My place, tonight. Wear this. - Do you have your card? Yes. Don't forget the pipe. - It's really sad that your dog ran away, But why did it keep you from going to the park? I was afraid I would find him In the park playing with another kid. Why? - I guess that's why I thought he ran away in the first place To find a kid he liked better. - Dogs don't do that. - Right? Why would a dog do that? - I don't know. - When I hear myself say it, it just sounds ridiculous. But I never said it out loud, so It's very important for you To be liked, isn't it? Well, let's not get too This isn't a counseling session. Okay. You son of a gun. You son of a bitch. Wow, okay. - I'm just trying to help you, Michael. - You bitch, God! - Michael. - You're very helpful, aren't you? - I'm trying to - you try to help everybody. Do you wanna play another game? - I just wanna - you are good. But you know what? You can't help people. You couldn't help your marriage. - Hey. - Lose, you lose. I don't need your help, Nobody needs your help. Nobody wants it! You can't help anybody. I don't need your help! Am I gonna make you cry? - Just fill them out any way you want. Okay. - Have Erin fax them back to corporate. Will do. - Okay, filled outGood. Thank you, doctor, take two of these And call me in the morning. Hey, Michael? Um, about three months ago, I was talking There are a lot of one-person departments here, So there's a lot of department heads. But I'm off to a good start. Oh, man, if I can pull this off, It will be the scam of all scams. And yet, very helpful to everyone. - So corporate got your evaluations, And they wanted me to double-check Is that really how you feel about Michael's situation? Yes. - That is not how he seemed to me. I thought he seemed fine. - You marked "severe" in all the categories, Including "at risk for homicidal behavior." - I saw a TLC show on Kate Walsh's home office. All corkboard. - We can do that. - Right in here. Easily. Knock, knock. Pam? Perfect. Um, I was hoping to talk to the office administrator About a little office administration problem. - But of course. - Great. The problem, unfortunately, Is about the office administrator. I have gone through everything from the past three years. There is nothing that says That you're office administrator. - So weird that there's no paperwork. At all. - Although, like, unlikely things happen All the time. My best friend in High School, she went to Australia, Canberra I think, and she met this guy Who lived only two streets away from her in America. - Pam, I don't want to accuse you of anything. I just want everything to be back The way it's supposed to be. Can you just admit Admit Admit what? I don't want to say it. Say it. - Say that I'm lying, or say I have the job. Make a definitive statement, Gabe. Statements of such a nature, While they have their place, are overused In a competitive business environment. Great. Well, let me know if you need a new chair, Or anything that an office administrator can handle. Will do. Could I get one of those nameplates That says "Gabe lewis"? - For sure. Anything else? I'll get it right away. The first lesson of watching World poker tour at 2:00 A.M.: You play the opponent, not the cards. Is that what we're here for? A crystal wizard. I like it. - It's a pewter wizard, holding a crystal. Wait a second. You know you can't buy that now, right? I can come back and get it for you later, But I'm saying right now, we can't do that.

I'm terribly sorry about what happened. - You work on commission, don't you? - Stop, stop. - No. Hold on one second. Did you just say you remember him? Of course. But, uh, he looks much less threatening now. What does that mean? We had a safety concern. We very politely indicated that he'd be welcomed back Good morning. - If he were in accordance with our dress policy. - What? - The bloodstained hands. It was beet juice. I'm a beet farmer, id - I'm very sorry. - Good sir. I happened to have been working a very long day that day, When I came to your fine estab You are so I'm gonna Okay, listen, you can't treat Thank you. Good morning, sir! Okay. - You made a big mistake! Huge! - There it is. All right. - That was pretty good. - Thank you. Please. I'll take the wizard. Uh, okay. - You forged them. You forged the forms. - You filled them in and faxed them yourself. - Yes. - You remember that. - Yes, but you had me so worked up That I made a mistake. - Unless a part of you made that mistake on purpose. - You don't make a mistake on purpose, Toby. Then it's no longer a mistake. Gabe. He messed it up. He messed up the forms, I bet. I wanna mess everything up So I can fix it and keep my job. - Good thing I'm here, 'cause I do nothing. I make everybody nervous. Aah! Okay. That's your notebook? All right. All right. Let's bang this out. Let's do it to it. That's the office, huh? Look at that. ***** ******* Right, oh.. I wonder why, uh It feels like that. Psychiatrists tend to be more crazy than their patients. Therapists are whores. Psychiatry is a narcissism machine. I learn more from Dr.** than from Dr. Froyd. Earth. You don't have to be crazy to live here. But it helps. I don't know Just use the best one. did sweeney Todd   the demon barber of fleet street  Did you write this? - No. - Who did? - Stephen sondheim. - Who is he?  swing your razor wide, sweeney   hold it to to the skies   freely flows the blood of those who moralize  What the hell is happening? We are the cast of sweeney Todd: The demon barber of fleet street. We open in a couple of weeks at the loose screw playhouse, Here in Scranton, and today, just doing a wee bit of viral marketing, gov'nor!  attend the tale of sweeney Todd   ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh   he served a dark and a vengeful God   he served a dark and a vengeful God   ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh   what happens then, well, that's the play   and he wouldn't want us to give it away   not sweeney Todd   the demon barber of fleet   street  Oh, that was amazing! That was awesome! I auditioned for this! When did the cast list go up? Like a month ago. Really? They didn't call me! Who am I playing? Andy? Two comps for m'lady and her Gabe. It's closing night. Tomorrow we have to give the theater over To the Scranton's miss fitness pageant. I am so excited, but I just need one. Gabe can't come. Sorry. - What? - Yeah. That's awful. Everyone's gonna miss that guy. Gabe is not coming, which is huge, Because my plan is to make Erin Fall back in love with me tonight. Women cannot resist a man singing show tunes. It's so powerful, even a lot of men Can't resist a man singing show tunes. - Oh, who else is going? - Everyone. Gabe seemed to think no one was going. What kind of terrible rumor monger is Gabe? He is woefully ill informed, all right? Excuse me, Clink, clink, clink, clink, everybody. You're all coming to my show tonight, right? Andy, what time's it start? - 8:00 P.M. Sharp. - How long is it? - Hour, 45. - No, I can't make it. They say that no one can take your pride, But the people who cast Andy's play, They took mine. Jim, Pam, you guys are in, right? Oh, we wanted to, But our sitter just fell through. I'm really sorry. Dwight? Uh, no, thank you. Last time I went to the theater, A man dressed as a cat sat on my lap. It would mean so much to me If you came to my show tonight. I can't, Andy. It's too hard. That's I put everything I had into that audition. Do you understand that? If it makes you feel any better, No one who auditioned for the part of sweeney Todd Got that part. They had to bring in a ringer. This guy's, like, world class. You should not feel bad. I'm asking you thespian to thespian. Will you please be the bigger man And come to my show? I wish I could, Andy, But I can't. I have plans that night. I'm going to see a friend in a play called sweeney Todd. You're that friend. I'm going to see your play. Noishe! And scene. Listen, I would like you to take me to Andy's play tonight. Please, waste of time. You know what? Let's just knock this out right now. Disrobe. Angela? Don't like her anymore. Not attracted to her anymore. Just contractually obligated to make a baby with her. Give me the punch card. No. If you want to punch the punch card, You have to take me to the show. That is not in the contract. Well, there's a lot of gray area in that clause. Do you want to re-mediate? All right, fine! I'll go to your little show, But I'm not wearing a cape. Thank you. Dwight and I have a contractual agreement To procreate five times, plain and simple. And should he develop feelings for me? Well, that would be permissible Under item 7c, clause 2, so I would not object. Hey. How are those salads? It's my own fault My parents used to scramble to find babysitters So they could take my little brother to do stuff. I understand how hard it can be. I just tonight, I mean, if you could We'll keep looking. - Yes! - Really? I mean, who knows? Maybe I have a niece my family never told me about. Oh, my gosh, that would be amazing. - Yeah. - For a lot of reasons. Yeah, I know. Neiche! Oh, hey, guys. You brought balloons to a play? I did, because I am being the bigger man, And balloons are bigger than flowers. It's nice, like up. Yes. Excuse me. Are you the guy that did an entire law &amp; order episode For his audition? Nope. - Guys? - Hey! - Andy! - Hey! You all made it. Thank you so much. You should actually thank Erin. She's the one who agreed to babysit. She's babysitting? I really wanted to see Andy's play, Because he's so, so talented, But I've been trying to get in the babysitting game forever. The 13-year-olds in this town Have a complete monopoly. It's almost like a babysitters' club. I understand. This is like Huge opportunity for her. This is ridiculous. You'd think they'd discourage people From bringing in balloons. Hey, I think this guy playing sweeney Todd is my plumber. No, Darryl. This guy's a world-class actor. He doesn't daylight as your plumber. No, it's my plumber. Says so in his bio. Apparently, the director discovered him doing karaoke. It's his first play. He didn't even audition. Are you kidding me? If we don't listen to the overture, We won't recognize the musical themes When they come back later. All right, I'm sorry.

See if I got any last-minute "break a legs" Or "I still love you" type texts. -  by the seaside, ooh-hoo  Doesn't look like I got anything. Maybe on my facebook wall. - Unfortunately, in this ham-fisted production Of sweeney Todd, The real terror comes from the vocal performances. New paragraph. Mr. Todd! Mr. Todd! I found her! You found johanna. That monster of a judge Has locked her Locked her away There's a little bird uttering around. Do hope it ceases chirping. How is that funny? The bird continues to call. Someone please turn off yourBird. Oh, for the love turn your phone off! There are signs! Oh, it appears the bird was in mine own pocket This whole time. He's gone to sleep now. I closed his beak. Mmm[laughing alone] What is the news of my darling daughter johanna? You know what? Let me just double check, Make sure that bird Okay, good. It's off. I mean, silenced. I silenced it by killing it. I've killed it! I'm a murderer! Just like you, sweeney Todd! See? It all connects. Not that I know you're a murderer. My character doesn't know that yet. But I'm suspicious, Because of all the razors That you have laying around. And you spend time alone, But you're a barber, so that'legit. So there's that. But Where is johanna? - A madhouse. - A madhouse? - Yes, a madhouse. - A madhouse? Johanna is as good as rescued. Where do you suppose All the wig makers of london Go to obtain their human hair? Do you think So you think So you think fogg's asylum, why not? Sounds like cece. Okay, I think everybody just needs to relax. Oh, my God, go, go. Oh, my God. That's really irresponsible of Erin. S a ible bysitter. I just didn't think you guys were gonna see us. We were just gonna stop by and then get some ice cream And then go home. Okay, this was pretty simple. Why are you here? All you had to do was play with her For, like, 30 minutes and then put her to bed. Then we were kind of hoping That you wouldn't touch her again. Babies shouldn't have ice cream, by the way. I'm sorry. I just I really wanted to see Andy. You guys made it sound so unmissable, And you set me up with a car seat and everything. Well, the car seat was to take her to the hospital or But why would I take her to the hospital? You know what, it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. Why don't I just take her home, And let you guys finish, And then you should stay out as late as you want. No, we're good. Thank you, though. - Yeah. - Thanks. Okay. All right, bye, cece. - Okay. - All right. Well, we're never leaving the house again. Not together. That was more horrifying than nunsense. All that singing got in the way Of some perfectly good murders. Where's my car? Come on. Mmm! Fruit is so much better when it's dried. I've already eaten, like, 30 apricots. - Darryl? - Hey! Didn't know you were gonna be here. How's the toilet? Silent. Look, congratulations. Thank you. I had no idea. This plumber has pipes. Yeah, good job. Well done. You're the guy who booed me. No, there were a lot of people booing you. I wasn't one of them. No, I saw you, And you were the only one. Get your eyes checked, chucklehead. Be cool, Michael. I saw this guy kill a bunch of people. Good work. Thank you. You didn't have to boo him. Well, he was getting a lot of applause, And I just didn't think it was indicative Of how people were really feeling. How would you like it if we booed you? That would never happen. - Okay. - Boo! I appreciate the feedback. I don't like that at all. Are you ready? Yes. Oh, I'm so scared! Okay, kill me! Just kill me! Kill me! Ah, blood everywhere. I'm so glad we're hanging out again outside of work. Yeah, me, too. Okay, I kill you now. - Okay. - All right. All right, let's do this. No, actually, Dwight, I didn't realize how far this walk was, And I I'm exhausted. It's okay, I smell. No. No, no, no. I think I just want to go home, But it's okay. This can count as one of your times. No, no, no. Contractually, we're obligated to have sex. Well, I won't tell if you don't. I will tell. I will tell the mediator. What what are you Oh, okay. Oh, was that in the way? Get rid of it. Good night, Dwight. Good night. These would have been your seats. Best seats in the house. Lot of people think it would be the front row, But, actually, right here, This is where the speakers converge And the sound just, like, nails you right here. This is awesome. Sorry. Oh. Hi, Gabe. Yeah, I just stopped by Andy's cast party To say hi to everyone. Oh, sure, I can pick you up some soup. What do you want? That's broth, Gabe. Okay, I I'll see you soup. [giggles] Okay, I have to go. Thank you so much. This is so much fun, And I'm really sorry that I missed your play, But next time, I'll be there. Or here. Right here, I promise. Awesome. - Okay. - See you later. Thank you. It's like the hurt locker. This night was a disaster. No, it was not a disaster. It was weird, but it wasn't a disaster. I think we have, like, a gift bottle of irish cream. Yeah? We could put that in orange juice. - Get it. - Yeah? - Let's get our juice on. - Yeah. [to rhythm of who let the dogs out] ruh ruh ruh ruh-ruh. Found him. Hey, what's going on here? Post-show blues? Yeah, I guess you could say that. Yeah, I get those every day after work. Your show was really great, Andy. Interesting subject matter. I'm surprised you pulled it off. It was like amateur hour. It was an amateur production, technically. Oscar, enough with the sass, please! God! What is wrong with you? Andy, listen to me. Look me in the eye. I thought that you were awesome. Stop just saying that. I am not just saying that. You can trust that I am telling you the truth. I booed someone tonight. I have no filter. And if I thought you were terrible, I would have booed. And if I thought you had done a better job, I would be saying nicer things right now. But I thought that you were exactly awesome. No better, no worse. Thank you. That feels good. I did not say that to make you feel good. I just said it. Total integrity. Andy, sing us another song. Thanks, but I feel like a loner right now. Oh, come on, Andy. You were the highlight. Come on, Andy, seriously. Andy! Andy! Andy! Andy! Andy! Okay, all right, all right, all right.

Just a cold sore. - Just a cold sore. Thank you. Phyllis, I don't have acne. I have a cold sore. I didn't even have a cold. I don't know how I got it. I know how you got it. - How? - Michael, come on. A cold sore is herpes. - What? - What you should do, Michael, Is have a doctor take a look at it, 'cause we don't really know what that is. I know tons and tons of people who have herpes. I have it myself. That's what it is. I've never seen herpes on you. 'cause it's on my genitals, genius. You have a penis? Michael, have you ever been tested for STDs? Yeah. My last physical when I was 40. That was like ten years ago. No, it was like four years ago. Michael, you're at least 46. Why at least? If you're guessing 46, just say 46. Can please talk about how gross Meredith is? This is what you get When you treat your body like an outhouse. You know what, guys? How 'bout we just chill out a little bit on the herp chat? Okay? I was an r.A. In college, And I can tell you, The number one sexually transmitted disease Is ignorance. I guess maybe she could marry a meth dealer with crabs I don't even want to know about these things. Hey, guys. How did this happen? How did I get this? Sometimes it can lie dormant in a woman for years. They may not even ow that they have it. You ow what? I feel like One of those old-timey sailors with VD. Eh, it's me own darn fault. Girl in every port! But what port? The Jan port? The Holly port? Don't even Holly was clean, okay? If anything, I gave it to her. - You may have. - Oh, my God. What if I did? You need to contact Holly. You need to notify her that she is crawling with herpes. Okay. You know what? Might. Might be crawling with herpes. I might have gotten it after her. You need to contact every woman you've been with And notify them of your herpes infestation. It's the right thing to do. There's no way I'm gonna do that. - Then I will. - All right, I Now, I'm no doctor, but it seems to me That we all have an obligation to the public health To track down anyone who gives us a disease, Inform them of it, And take overwhelming revenge on that person. Again, I'm no doctor. I'm just a normal guy who enjoys revenge. Hello. Hi, Donna. It's Michael. Michael. I didn't think I'd hear from you. How've you been?

Seems recent. - No, that's Andy, the reason it seems more recent Is because many of us here have never stood up And asked for everyone's attention, And it seems like you've done that on several occasions. Everyone, I've noticed that We've not been entirely kind to one of our own, Due to stigmas and prejudices. Oh, when you got your new phone That's when you asked for everyone's attention. World cup. That's what I was thinkin'. You kept announcing scores. It's the world's only international sport, so This is hoy. No, this is Holly. No This is Holly. No, this is Holly. NoThis is Michael Scott. Busted. So what can I do for you, Holly? I'm calling because There was a terrible car accident. Oh, really? Was anyone killed? A lot of people. - Any nuns? - Three nuns.

WellThere was a bit of a learning curve In the conversation department, But between the sheets, We were like Jordan and pippen. Well, if there's anything exciting about it, It was because we both knew it was wrong. - Because we worked together. - No. Okay, imagine there's a princess Who falls for a guy beneath her station, And the queen doesn't like this at all. And the princess knows that the queen doesn't like it, And so it makes her want to do it all the more Just to get at the queen. - Am I the princess? - No, I'm the princess. And the queen. Okay.

No! that's so 'cause the receptionist told me that a man called, But he would only say that he was my ex-lover. - Weird. - Yeah. Sounds like a nice guy. I don't know, I mean, people were being really mean to Meredith But this wasn't really about Meredith, was it? You and Erin were broken up How is that relevant to anything? I asked you if it was okay if I asked her out. You said and I quote "my good sir, nothing would make me happier Than to hand you the hand of the hand once in my hand." I specifically remembered it Because you said it in such a weird way. Well, the only reason I said that Is 'cause you asked me so politely And it was very difficult for me to say no.

They're smaller than we are. What's our excuse? How do we combat this guy? Stanley, how do we combat him? - We sell better? - Okay. You know what?

And it makes more sense when I'm standing next to Popeye, But Jim doesn't want to put his costume on. I am Popeye. I've never really been a costume guy. Even when I was a kid, it just felt like something I was too old for, heh. And then, this morning, Pam hands me this little number. No. - In case you can't read my-my-my poker face We will be reviewing our sales policies. I have ten seconds to explain them Or this whole place blows up. MacGruber! Lame. Why don't witches wear panties? Oh, here we go. Because they need to grip the broom. - Oh! Who likes to water-ski on Lake Erie? No, what Where does Dracula like to water ski? Lake Erie. When our warehouse workers make deliveries, They're gonna be encouraged to offer clients Extra products. And then they will split those commissions with sales. Wait, so drivers are gonna be able to sell paper On the road? That is correct. - Has anyone started calling you Gabe-wad yet? Not here, no. - Gabe-wad. Okay, guys, fun is fun, but Blacula. Dracula. Oh, so I almost forgot. You'll find this hilarious. Apparently, corporate is going to have Drivers sell paper on their routes now. That's like exactly sort of the idea that you had. Yes, I do remember saying something like that to you. Yeah. I'm sorry. I blew this. You should have gotten credit for that, man. I'm just glad we're gonna try it out. Really? We're good? We're cool. Okay. Okay. What's that in your shirt? Oh, that's a ream of paper. Thought you might hit me. Darryl Philbin is the greatest guy In the world. And you know what I'd like? I would like to have all the racists Brought together And take Darryl Philbin out to lunch. Just to see what they're missing. It's a great stick, right? It's really good. Classic. I feel like you might win the whole thing with that. Thanks. Everyone realizes this coupon book Is not actually worth $15,000, right? You'd have to spend $200,000 on crap you don't even need To get $15,000 worth of benefits. Heh, I'm not the only one who sees this, right? No. - No, it - no. I get that. I get that. Um, excuse me, everyone. I want to invite you all to the Halloween party I'm having at my bar. You own a bar? Public school at exit 11? That's a greatName. You're hilarious. A-plus. SoYou're all on the list. - Hey, man, can I get a plus-five? It's all guys. Hey, what's the crowd like, Danny? Our age? Okay. I don't think that she would leave Jim For Danny. I don't know. They're both handsome. Pam is gonna choose whoever has a scent Most like that of her father. Does anyone remember what her dad smelled like? - I think he - hey, hey, gang, quiet. Here she comes. Did you hear about that Danny guy? Heard he used to date Pam. So, four years ago, When I was in Stanford, Connecticut And dating someone else - Mm-hmm. Pam went on two dates with Danny. Which was obviously The greatest love story ever told, Given how much people are walking on eggshells around us. We were basically Romeo and Juliet. - That's right. - Except where Juliet Doesn't have that great a time, And Romeo doesn't call back after two dates. Yikes. But I've learned to love again. He's a cartoon sailor. no. And he looks so handsome in his uniform. Please. No, I'm not gonna no. Tuna. Tuna. If you want us to skip this party I don't care. I am never gonna forget What Danny did to Pam. I forget nothing. I'm like an elephant in that way. You know what eleph buh this This sucks for Jim, right? But it also sucks for us, Because we don't get invited to a ton of Halloween parties. Yeah, and, like, everyone's gonna be there. Stanley, Phyllis, Angela, Darryl, creed's a maybe. Creed's going? Madge from the warehouse Just made her first sale. Madge. We should have been doing this a long time ago. Erin, would you please do me a solid And get Darryl Philbin on the speakerphone. Hello. Hi, Darryl. Come out here, please. I'm good. You need to stop being so shy. Come out here and embrace who you really are, Superstar. This is embarrassing, Michael. Yeah, I bet it is. If you're gonna do your job well here You gotta get used to being embarrassed. Let me put my shoes on. Um, hit the speakerphone button. The speakerphone button? Same button as you hit before. Or sit on it. This whole delivery/sales idea, You know whose that was? That was Darryl Philbin's. He thought of that way before the corporate fat suits. So what happened? I got in the way. I said no. And it just stopped. But then, corporate comes up with this idea. But you know what? They need to know that it was yours. And I don't care if I take a bullet, We're going to call them. We're going to put them on speakerphone right now. And we are going to straighten this out. Screw corporate. They probably stole the idea anyway. Corporate stole nothing. Okay? Darryl brought this idea to me, And then I told them, giving Darryl full credit. So no need to "screw corporate." Everyone, let's give Darryl a round of applause As planned. I'm a little peeved at Darryl right now. He went to Gabe behind your back. No, he didn't go behind my back, He went over my head. He went over your head to go behind your back. What is taking someone from behind? No, shh, Michael, listen. This cannot stand. We can't have workers going straight to corporate. It makes your job superfluous. It was a good idea, though. Yeah, here's another good idea. Corporate chain of command. We need to strangle Darryl's idea. - Hey, Danny. - Hey. I'm really sorry, But we can't come to your party tonight. Ah, I was looking forward To throwing some darts with you guys. - Well - Okay, well, then, Maybe we could do it Like next Halloween. - Oh, for sure. - We're just, like, Totally caught in the middle here. What are you talking about? Well, Jim and Pam basically begged us not to go. Jim and Pam really don't want you to go? They're really upset About the whole Danny situation. I'll talk to them. Yeah, but just don't tell them That we said anything to you. Okay? Okay. Or you're dead. Okay. Okay. Kelly. Great costume. - Thanks. - Oh Kelly! You cannot change costumes In the middle of the day! Pam, she's out. Um, if I'm out, I'm gonna Sue this entire company For discrimination! Guys, you're arguing over a 1 in 16 chance. Over a prize worth Um, 15,000 bucks, Oscar. Yeah, shut it, Oscar. Pam. This is an amazing prize. I mean, I don't even want to give Pam a compliment 'cause she's so blech. But she did a good job. I really want that coupon book. Garbage magnet. Garbage magnet. God, magnets are interesting enough. You don't need to tart 'em up with some design. I can't believe this doesn't make you mad. What the hell are they talking about? Hmm, Kevin and Gabe. Probably about the extremes of the human physique. Do you think Kevin is going over my head? I don't oh, my God. Okay, all right! All right! All right, you know what? That's inappropriate, Kevin. I am your boss, and if you have something to say, It goes through me, And then I take it to Gabe. Chain of command. Do you understand? - I am so sorry. - Oh, you're sorry? - I just thought - what did you just thought? Well, Gabe asked me if there were any really cool Lady gaga moves that he could do for the catwalk, And so then I told All right. I told him that there was this one cool move Where she powers down like a robot. Okay. Okay? But I'm so sorry that I didn't tell you first. Well, don't let it happen again. You think that I would let this happen again? No way, Jose! I'm you, Gabe. Okay. Can you imagine? It's just crazy. That is crazy. We would never care if Andy or Kevin went to your party. Look, I'm just glad we can laugh about it, Because I was a little nervous about coming to work here With, you know, our history. Oh, my gosh. Everyone keeps blowing that out of proportion. It's not even a history. Exactly. It's not like you guys had some long relationship, right? Big, painful breakup I don't know about? - Two or three dates. - It was two. Was it two? I thought it was three. No, we, um We had plans for a third, But then, I don't know, You never called me back, so Ooh. You can't handle the truth. Well, that does not sound like me. Yeah. It was, though. That's what happened. Well, great. I just wanted to make sure things weren't weird. Okay, this whole "going over my head gate" Is making people act weird. Chain of command is crumbling. Do you know what just happened? I just made Kevin cry. And Gabe looks like lady gaga. That's not Halloween. Halloween should be a day in which we honor monsters And not be mad at each other. I'm not mad. Are you mad? You went over my head, and then you lied to my face, So my head and my face have taken a beating. Well, I'm sorry if it seems that way to you. Okay, that might help, If you said "I'm sorry" in front of everybody - Mike. - In front of me. You made a bad call. And I fixed it. So I'm not apologizing. So that's it? - That's it. - Is it? Yes. Suck it. Bill Compton from true blood. How many freakin' vampires Am I supposed to care about these days? I guess you could say I'm still in costume. I'm a rational consumer. Oh, yeah. Stupid coupon booklet. You see my costume? I'm a rational consumer. Yeah, I heard you say it to Phyllis. That's a good line. Okay, everybody, after you walk the runway, Everyone has to vote for who gets the coupon book, And you can't vote for yourself. Pam, can you vote for other people? Got to get in on this. Hey, it's cool, man. I work in the warehouse. I'm cool! I'm hip and I'm jive, But I don't care about nobody! Do you know who I am? Happy Halloween, jerk! Still don't know who I am? I'll give you a hint. I go over other people's heads. Michael, this is a bad idea. What's a bad idea? Dressing up as somebody I mean, when has that ever worked for you? Never! Okay, you know what? Fine. I'm not Darryl. And thank God I'm not Darryl. Could you for once just let us enjoy a party Instead of making it about all your issues?  get a jolt from my electrode   they did the monster mash   the monster mash  He's a warrior.  they did the mash  Yes. Yeah.  they did the monster mash  I present to you the "rational consumer." As it were.  Igor on chains backed by his baying hounds  Slow. Nice and slow, honey, yeah. Angela as a nurse. Don't slow it down. There it is. I don't like your tone. Look, they were sold out Of all the other costumes, okay? Think we all live in the real world here. Let's not pretend to be unaware Of what sells in this office. What should we ask? Hey, can I play? Why don't you ask if Darryl is a bad friend Who backstabs people in the back? We have one question to ask the spirit world, And you want us to ask that? He says no. Ah, Darryl moved it. You moved it. No. Hey, Dwight, you saw Darryl move it, right? Let's just say I saw Exactly what the two of you wanted me to see. I know how to sit on a fence. Hell, I can even sleep on a fence. The trick is to do it face down With the post in your mouth. If you had one word you would use to describe Darryl, What would that word be? "a" "s" "s". "h". No. "e" "t". An asset. Aah! Aah! That's enough. I don't think it's gonna work out the way you think. I don't think you get it. - Hey. - Hey. This is some party, huh? When you work hard, you play hard around here. Even if you don't work hard. Oh, here's something. Mm? Uh, why didn't you ever call Pam back? Are you serious? Yeah. I mean, I'm not saying that everybody Has to fall in love or anything. I'm just saying, but to, you know, To not even call her back is Know what it was? I think she gave me her number, But then, like, her fours looked like eights, and then Could be. But you also called her the second time, So you had the number right. Halpert, you looking for someone to bang your wife? - Nope. - Okay. You want to know? I didn't call her back Because she spent the whole date talking about you. She was obviously in love with you.  grooving from side to side  Wait, she hasn't moved in a while. Erin. Er Two. I got two. I ate two whole apples. I'd remember talking about Jim. That wasn't it. Just tell her the real reason. You honestly want to know Why I didn't call her back on a date over four years ago? Hey, she had a nice time. It seems rude. I did. Yeah. And it's one of those things That's just gonna keep gnawing at me. Like gnaw, gnaw. "why? Why didn't he? I have no idea why." okay. Honestly, I didn't call you back 'cause I thought you seemed a little Dorky. - Hey, man - Thank you. Thank you. I got it. Now I know. You thought I was a little dorky. You know? Okay. Well, excuse me. In the future, you need To get Michael's approval On anything before coming to me. Thank you. You're gonna miss out on some good ideas. Okay, well, obviously, If it's a really really good idea, Then my door is open to that. If they're good ideas, I'm not gonna say no. - You said no to this one. - That's okay. I make one mistake in 15 years And you drag me over the coals. After everything I did for you? - What have you done for me? - Oh - What have you done for me? - Well Ed truck hired me. Jo promoted me. Gabe listened to me. All you've ever done was say no to me. I have ambition. And you kept me at the same level for years. Oh, dropping bombs, right? Must really make you think, Michael. Stop it. Stop. Stop. We're thinking. We're thinking about it. Yeah. You don't have to point to the fact That we're thinking about it. Stop it. Just let us think. Okay, next time you have a really great idea, We will put it in a hat And then we will have Erin pick it out of the hat And let her decide. I don't understand the point of the hat. You're right. We don't need a hat. I am not budging on the hat issue. Okay, we're gonna table the hat question. The best ideas are gonna come to me. I make the final decision. Period. Okay. We both reserve the right to go to Jo If we disagree with Gabe. - Okay. - Fair enough. Why don't we simplify this? Darryl brings it to Michael. Michael brings it to me. No one calls Jo. Unless you and I decide we want to talk to Jo. Then we'll give her a call. Cool. Yeah. I'm sorry I lied to you. I'm sorry. I was a jerk. Friends fight. Friends fight. What's up, man? Sometimes it seems like It was better down in the warehouse, you know? When I was a freshman in college, I worked at the student newspaper, The Cornell daily sun. This was at Cornell. I had to write an op-ed column Bernard's regards. This was your freshman year? I started to ask myself "do I have big plans here?" I didn't want to become editor of that paper. So I got up and walked right out of Walter Bernard hall. And that's actually when I heard Eight male voices singing, Unencumbered by instruments. I was hooked. So is becoming CEO of this company Your a cappella group? Come on. We're going to Danny's bar. Public school. No, I got some work to do. I do have big plans at this company. To be honest, I still can't believe He didn't call her back. Who doesn't call a dork like that back? Spinach in a can. Powerful spinach. A-gah-gah-gah-gah. - Aw, my hero. Okay, everyone, I've tallied the votes. And the winner of the costume celebration spectacular And the Scranton/Wilkes-barre coupon book, Oscar Martinez. Really? If I have to vote for someone I don't want it to be someone who can be me. Shake things up. I'm an inner guy. Best Edward James Olmos costume I've ever seen. Like freaky good. I know a lot of us have been feeling under the weather lately, it's that time of year and according to a study done by the University of Arizona, they discovered that your keyboards have hundreds of time more bacteria per square inch Than a toilet seat. That's true. That's true. I dated her mama. And you know what? Stop. One of the simplest ways to cut down On the spread of germs is to use something Called the vampire cough. Did you say vampire? Oh, no, it's just that, if a vampire had to cough, He would do it like this. [coughs] - Uh-huh, right, And ruin their cloaks? Do you have any idea how expensive wool is In Transylvania? 'cause of the euro. Well, other things you can do To help cut down on the spread of disease Are to wash your hands regularly, Don't come in if you're sick, And get your flu shot. Also, I'm going to set up hand-sanitizing stations Around the office. No. No, no. They will cost you your life. Elaborate. The worst thing you can do for your immune system Is to coddle it. They need to fight their own battles. If Sabre really cared About our well-being, They would set up hand-desanitizing stations. A simple bowl at every juncture filled with dirt, vomit, Fecal matter. - I'm not going to do that. - Exposing yourself to germs Is the best way to make yourself stronger. So by that rationale, if I had to sneeze, I should just sneeze on you. Yes. I would welcome it. [sneezes] You're welcome. The principle is sound. To avoid illness, expose yourself to germs, Enabling your immune system to develop antibodies. [sneezes] I don't know why everyone doesn't do this. Maybe they have something against living forever. [cheerful music] Jim. Pam. And the precious bundle of God's best everything. I wish you both a pleasant day. And you too. Yes. Praise God. Okay. Cece's getting christened today. - Big day. - Everyone from work is here. We weren't planning on that. Nope. Top o' the Sunday morning to you. And a top o' the day to you too, sir. I hope you brought your pipes. We're about to smoke the opium of the masses. - Oh, yes, doobie-doobie-doo. I invited everyone in the office Because it's not a day for just Jim Or Pam or the baby or me. It is about us all. And I thought we should all celebrate My joy and our all of our joys. Ah, man. Does the nard dog want nard pups? Yeah. I want a big old litter of nard pups, All jumping around and sucking on the teat. Put 'em in a box, give 'em to my neighbors. Yeah, I want kids. For all your paper and printer needs. For all your paper and printer needs. For all your paper and printer need Sunday church service. It's been a few years. The big guy and I, we've got some catching up to do. [imitating Marlon Brando] hey. Hey. I got an offer that you can't refuse. Scooch over. Oh, Michael, this is just for family. But I'm the godfather. It is really funny, but you know That can be confusing at a christening, Because you are not the godfather. [imitating Robert De Niro] are you talking to me? - Okay, your turn. - Scooch, Before I shoot you in the head. Okay, Michael, um, You know I love when you do that voice, But today, I'm so sorry, Need you to tell me that you know You're not Cece's godfather. Yeah. I'm sorry, Michael. I need you to say it. I'm so sorry. I'm not the godfather. Okay. Thank you. So who is the godfather? Our friend Seth and his wife there. Okay. Old friend, like, you've known him since kindergarten? No, I met his wife in mommy and me. They're a great couple. You should meet them later. No, I have plenty of friends, so All right, well, you have great seats. Enjoy the show. Okay. Thank you for coming, Michael. I don't even know how to say this. But Cece is turning out To be a little b-I-t-c-h. And that's not true, But her parents are Ki. All:  we ask you, lord   come to our aid  Good morning. All: Good morning. - Good morning. - What a terrific day this is. And not just because the eagles are playing. [laughs] You may ha see the bus out front. Today we also say good-bye to our young adult ministry. They're leaving for three months To build a school for the village of Quimixto In Cabo Corrientes, Mexico. I've heard of that place. If you go to Cabo San Lucas, All the prostitutes are from Cabo Corrientes. Okay, this is all right, this is silly. Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope. And thank you for your prayers For Justin. We hope for a speedy recovery. Thank you. Anyone else with a prayer Or a remembrance? Good morning. Dwight Schrute. Thank you all for your prayers And your remembrances. Like Justin and his disfigurement, I too have had a horrible year. They say that the middle class is disappearing, And, with it, the soul of America. , as a gift to this beautiful congregation, I would like to offer A 4% discount on all Dunder Mifflin Sabre products If you buy a printer at full price Christening calls to repentance, To faithfulness, and to discipleship. We've come to celebrate these babies. Somebody needs a change. Right now? Well, she can't bring this up with her. Okay. All right, come on. Where are we going?

No. There's no extra outfit in the bag. - You said you checked it. - I didSay that. At this time, will the families please come join me? Jim and Pam and Cece really seem To be clicking. They are totally gelling. It's as if they leave my office and they go to another office That sells happiness. And good for them. That's great, because, you know, The paper industry's not gonna last forever. [applause] Before we go, I'd like to remind everyone That the "halberts" have been kind enough To host a reception next door Immediately following the service. Mm. No. Wrong both counts. Okay, 'a, ' "halbert"? And, 'b, ' I think a more appropriate statement would be, "the halberts are hosting an intimate reception For their invited guests." For all their generosity of spirit, They password-protect their wireless? Try Jesus. Opus Dei. Hi. Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Hello. Shh, shh, shh. How are you? Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. I am feeling this. Call it the Holy spirit or the passion of the Christ. I am loving these people. - Hi. - Thanks for having us. I'm Doug McPherson, Davey's Uncle. Oh, well, Dave is an adorable baby. Davey. Yeah. Wow. Well, this is intimate. We just had to add a few more tables. We weren't expecting this many people. You don't know them all? Nope, and we're gonna need A loaves and fishes kind of miracle To feed 'em all. Jesus is not your caterer. But he should be your caterer, 'cause you're a little angel. Why didn't your parents get you a caterer? They don't think. Hmm. Don't listen to her. She's just jealous 'cause she doesn't get to come home To someone as cute as you. Huh, you think she is jealous about having a baby? I don't know. I'm just hungry. Okay, well, you know what, everybody's hungry. Sorry. I think I'm just hungry. Oh, after you. - Oh, no, after you. - No, I insist. After me. [laughs] I'm gonna use that one. Have a good lunch. Thank you. You too. This is not the meal I was promised. I'm going to have no energy for the rest of the day. I canceled my plans to come To this thing, and they repay me with this? You know what, guys, Let's just enjoy lunch. With what? How? Sometimes, Michael. Sometimes. Excuse me, everyone, On behalf of the youth ministry That's leaving for Mexico, I just wanted to thank our hosts And tell you about those good-looking guys And gals over there. [cheers and applause] Teach for America girls are way hotter, But they're nuts. This is Jessica Ortega. I met her when both she and I were both seven years old When my parents took me to Quimixto on a service trip. Who takes a kid to Mexico? I would run to Mexico if that's where the sandwiches are. - Shh. - Right now, Jessica's children Have to walk 12 miles to a school with dirt floors. No. It's gonna be three months of hard work, And when we're done, we'll practically be Quimixtanos. Greg, hello, it's Dwight from the vestibule. You want to know my 11th commandment? I will not be undersold. Hey, Dwight. Dwight, hey. I am ready to love thy neighbor With these kind of discounts. Are you kidding me? Stop it. I'll call you back. My parents explained it to me this way. You wouldn't hesitate to save a family member From a burning building, But what if the earth was your building And all the people on it were your family? What if the moon was your car And Jupiter was your hair brush? - Shh. - Thank you. Or should I say gracias? [applause] [sighs] Cece went down. What was this? You're out of it. - Scones. - I didn't get one. Well, if it makes you feel better, I didn't get one either. Is it just the one jug of apple cider? Who the heck was that? I think that was sconesy cider, Noted baptism reception critic. We need more food. I'll go get some subs and sodas. All right. And cider. [laughter] Look at that. Look at that. That's fun. We need to do stuff together Outside of work. Let's go help Africa. Let's go build an airport. We'll start all. We'll have a carwash. We'll Nd some cheerleaders to regionals. You could feed the hungry. Us. Why do we have to do something together? I volunteer at a clinic on my own time. - Yeah, well, that's just a pick-up scene. Okay, we don't have to volunteer. But I think we should hang out more together. We are hanging out right now. You want some more of this? Look at these people. These are church-going people. And they know how to party. Church isn't a party, Michael. - Well, it's it's - welcome to the party. Everybody have their kool-aid? No. Okay, you know what? This is inappropriate. What is wrong with you guys? What is wrong with you? What is so horrible about wanting to get together And do something nice? Why did you guys even come today? What's so great about your lives that you think You're better than everybody else? That you can make fun of everybody else? You're mean. You're mean girls. Like the movie mean girls. And Kevin and Stanley, If you don't stop worrying so much about what you're gonna put In your gullet, you're gonna die in about a month. Oh, hey, meemaw, Would you watch Cece for a second? Don't worry. She's asleep. I'm just gonna track down some more chairs. Fine, fine. I guess I'll watch Suzanne's purse and your baby. [applause] [cheers] [chatter] Bye. Good luck. Good luck to you. Bye. Do good. Do good. Bye. Have fun. We're proud of you. [cheers and applause] Bye. Okay. Hey. Hey. Is this the bus to Mexico? All: Yeah!

I'm staying on the bus. I'm already on the bus. I'm going. Michael, this is irresponsible. It is not irresponsible! I have never been more confident About a decision in my life. I agree. I think it's superb. Well, you have a job to do. Okay, there is no off-season when it comes to printer sales. You know what, my job will be here when I get back. Michael, you can't go to Mexico. You don't have your passport. You don't need one to get in. Plus, we can just have it sent to him down in Mexico. Hey, right? Michael, what am I supposed To tell my clients if they ask about you? Tell them that I died And I turned into an angel, And, when they feel a breeze In a room with all the windows closed Or that that chill on the back of their neck, That is just me watching over them. Okay, but what about the bigger corporate accounts? Tell them that I'm in a meeting. Michael, I am just about to close a sale. Can I authorize a 15% discount? - No, you may not. - Gah! I think it's really cool, Michael. I wish I had a job that I could just leave. Thank you. Save me an aisle seat, Michael! I'm coming! I will not stand idly by While these Mexican villagers are sick. We're actually building 'em a school. Whatever. I won't I won't stand for it. See you in a few months. If the whole world were like you guys, We wouldn't have so many problems. Mm. That's not gonna happen. We're one in a million. I know. Nobody I know would leave their jobs And friends and families To do manual labor for three months. Well, you know what, everybody thinks that I am crazy, And that tells me that I am the sanest person I know. So Just a heads up. Probably gonna be borrowing a few things. Gonna need a contact lens case, Some sunscreen, some sandals Why you always got to be so mean to me? Uh, meemaw, where's Cece? I don't know. I lost the purse too. Okay. - Good-bye, Lackawanna county. How long till we get to Mexico? Well, two days minus how long we've been on the road. So, like, two days basically. Maybe more. Ooh. What are we building down there again? Like, a hospital? A school for Mexicans? What? I don't know, I thought it was like a gymnasium or Why aren't they building it themselves? They don't know how. Do we know how? I don't know how. - Well, Carla knows. - You know how? Carla knows. Oh, I feel like there were so many more people on this bus. There were, like, Hey, Carla? Carla? Hi. What are you doing? Oh, trying to sleep. What is happening? Oh, God, what is happening? Do you smell like a weird, warm cheese? Oh, God, you know what? I am gonna be in Mexico for my half-birthday. - And the Christmas party. - And cinco De Mayo. Nah. No, we'll be back before that. No, we you know how these things go.

Swat swat's arriving. It is unknown he is armed with any They should do that thing where they play The really good music to get him to come out. Ugh, they shouldn't televise any of this. It just encourages copycats. Just say copies. Why do you have to drag cats into this? Okay, while this is interesting, We should get back to work. These standoffs can last a long time. What if it's another Waco? It's pronounced "wacko." Some events are so newsworthy, So historic, that you have to stop everything to watch. Balloon boy, Michael Jackson's funeral Uh, things that, if you didn't see them live, You wouldn't really care that you didn't see them at all.

Better men than Gabe have tried to be my boss. David got fired. Charles got fired. Jan went crazy. Ed truck, who I liked, Got decapitated. - Michael. - Yes. I find it absolutely disgraceful That no one followed you in here for your walk-out. I took the liberty of making a list of everyone Who didn't follow you in here. Jim, Oscar, creed, Me, at first Maybe I should go. Kelly Are you gonna quiet that baby Or do I have to? In the schrute family, The youngest child always raises the others. I've been raising children since I was a baby. Take a shot. Oh, thanks. So much Asian stuff. I wonder if there's a guy in China right now Looking at a bunch of our stuff. Why does Erin like Gabe? Andy, look, All I know is, if I was a girl And I had to choose between a tall dude Who loved Asia and a you-looking dude Who loved sweaters and wearing sweaters, I'd choose you. That's really nice. Thank you. And I'd blow your mind. Jim, what are you doing? Oh, it's a commercial break, So I just wanted to check the scores. Flip it back, please. Okay. The show's back on. What happened? - We were behind. - Go to the recorded version. Oh, my God. What song was that? - I wasn't recording it. - What? What song was it? Wait, why do you have to record it? Right now is why, Erin. We're living it. Start recording now. Jim. Okay, they did blinded by the light, And they did it with an actual blind guy. Was it worth it, Jim? 'cause we missed it. If I could get her sleeping normally, I would get my life back. That would be nice, wouldn't it? I can't even talk about it. You know, it's not really necessary for me to sit here Holding her all night. Just go to Gabe's refrigerator, Get a lump of suet Or any kind of congealed animal fat will do, really Tie a piece of string to it, Tie the other end to her toe, Pop the suet in her mouth, She'll be happy for hours. I kind of doubt Gabe has suet. Really? Well Then here we are. Michael. Gabe is making the pigs in a blanket. And he kind of needs some help, So he was wondering if you could help him. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Phyllis Vance. Is that white diamonds by Elizabeth Taylor? You know your perfumes. My nanny used to wear that. I just ate an entire seahorse. I have to admit I did not think it was gonna work. But it's totally working. I feel exactly like a seahorse. Look who I found. Yeah, well, I wasn't very hard to find. Let's go ahead and wash your hands. Is this the same dough that you used for the pizza crust? Yeah. Waste not. Right? So these are pizza dogs. These aren't pigs in a blanket. Per Se. Michael knows everything there is to know about snacks. - Well. - Gabe was born in 1982. He was the longest baby in the hospital. He's the longest baby in this room. What's the longest thing you've ever seen? For me, it was the trail from a jet Erin, you don't have to Yeah, you know what, Erin, you do have to.

You're four seasons in a day. You got the autumn thing going on. But if you put on baby Mm. But if you put on a blue It's springtime in the rockies. - Are you all right? - No! Insert it in my mouth. Okay, that's not gonna make Your pizza-eating experience any better, trust me. Oh, try me. Jim, just don't think Of it as degrading. Think of it as you happen to be moving the pizza Six inches this way, and he happens to be biting it. I'd prefer for him to think of it as degrading. Okay. Crust first. Okay. Now the beer.

Of course, you don't want to rush things. I mean, the anticipation can be so exquisite. Bob and I took our time. The first time we saw each other naked, We didn't even make love. We just stared at each other until we fell asleep. It was magical. - I have to go, Phyllis. - Really magical. Hey in there. It's me, Pam. It's not Dwight. Don't think it's Dwight. What are you doing here? I know you and Dwight have this weird deal. Um, he sent me out here to see if you could postpone. Are you authorized to do this? Yes. I have been so authorized.

I'll raise the roof. I will pull this car over. I hate it. I hate your car. See you, Oscar. If you break that girl's heart, I will kill you. It's just a figure of speech. But seriously if you break that girl's heart, I will literally kill you and your entire family. Gabe, just go and have fun with Erin. But not too much fun. That girl's gonna Rn my hair gray. - Uh-oh. Okay, okay, nobody panic. Listen up, listen up. Everyone, follow me to the shelter. We've got enough food for 14 days. After that, we have a difficult conversation. - My bad. Space Heater and Fan were both on high, plugged into the same outlet, so - uh, it's saying the server went down? Does Anybody know that password? 'cause otherwise, we can't do any work. - Uhtry "password." - Nope. - Try zero, Zero, Zero, Zero, zero, zero. - No. - Okay, now try Zero, Zero, Zero, Zero, zero, one. - Okay, I'm not doing every number. - Wait, um, does anyone remember when it was set up? - Uhit was, like, eight years ago? - Lord of the rings stuff? I don't know, I'm just trying to think of things that were happening at the time. - Um, everyone was getting their driver's license. - Why don't we just call the I.T. Guy who set it up? What's the name of the guy in Glasses, again? - Okay, moving backwards, our I.T. Guys have been glasses, turban, ear hair, fatty 3, shorts, fatty 2, lozenge, and fatso. I think lozenge was the one who installed it. - I got it. Try, um-- [coughs] - you know what, it made me laugh when I heard it, but Pam got really offended. - Big boobs. - Drama queen? - Nosy? - You're typing "big boobs"? - I'm trying everything. - Try "big boobs" with a "z." - That's-- [ding] the password. We're in. - All right. - Wow. - Yes. - The important thing is this kept us secure, people. [cheerful music]   - Morning. - How's it going? - Hey, I'm wuphf. - I'm facebook. - What's up, facebook? - I sent you a facebook message yesterday, I still haven't heard anything back. - You should've sent me a wuphf. - A what? - When you send a wuphf, it goes to your home phone, cell phone, Email, Facebook, twitter, and home screen. All at the same time. [phone rings] [melodic tone] [robotic voice] Wuphf. [together] - Wuphf! - Dot-com! - Thanks, Erin. - Sure. Pam. - Mm-hmm? - I don't wanna be a lousy snitch. - Okay. - Ryan has been using the color printer for his business a lot, and as office administrator-- - Oh, it's okay. - But it's not for-- - let it go. - Yes, I invested in wuphf. It's actually a really great idea, and I can't believe it didn't exist before. And I know Ryan's kind of a sketchy guy, but Hey, I married Jim. I've done my part for the nice guy. Now I want a bedroom set. - I think an INVESTORS ski trip, frankly, is the best idea. It will be a bonding experience. - I love it. - I was looking at a Trail map, and I was thinking that We should start on a Bunny hill, because I've never actually been skiing. And then work our way up to death drop. - Great, so we got our first offer to buy the company. [slaps desk] - You're kidding. - We could sell, but why think so small? We can just get a couple more people involved, really do this thing our way. - You and me, baby. - New Investors are key, though. That's actually why I came in today. - Don't you work here full time? - [chuckles] Today I was thinking I would sit down with a few of the people who haven't invested yet. - Mm-hmm. - Or we could do that together. If that sounds fun to you. - That does sound fun to me. - Awesome. - Ah, this is good hay. Yeah. This is the good stuff. Mattress quality. Every fall, growing up, my Uncle Eldred used to build us a Maze out of hay Bales for us kids to play in. We called it hay place. Eldred called it hay world. Eventually, lawyers were brought in. But that's all behind us. Hay place lives on. Watch it, watch it. Hello! Welcome to hay place. A place for hay. - Don't forget to make a Broom. - Oh, the petting zoo closes at 2:00, and the goat roast is at 3:00. Come on in, enjoy! - Hey. I'm kind of in the mood for a roll in the hay. - Roll in the hay, five dollars. - No, I meant - Oh, our contract. - Mm-hmm. - Yes, why don't we meet at the usual spot. Uh I've got a half an hour during lunch in-between the historical reenactment of the dunmore farm slaughters and the onion boil. - Perfect. - So, uh excuse me, get off of there. Those are show Bales, not play Bales. - All right, Thank you, I will-- I will send the contracts over right away. All right. Whoo! I am on the first hot sale streak of my life. I think it all comes from feeding cece, because no matter how much she resists, I sell her those carrots. Let's be honest-- if I can make mushed carrots seem better than a boob I can pretty much sell anything. - Commission comes out to dunh-duh-na-dah! Zero. - Mm-Kay, Well, it can't be zero, kev. - I entered the sale, and I hit enter, and I said, "dunh-duh-na-dah!" I'm pretty sure I timesed it right. - You met your commission cap last week. So from here until the end of the fiscal year, your commission will be zero. - What are you talking about? We--we have a commission cap? - It's a new corporate policy. - Dunh-duh-na-dah! - Is this job really about the money for you, Jim? I mean, isn't this where you fell in love? - A commission cap takes away my incentive to sell. So you realize I now have no reason to work, right? - When you're dealing with a large organization, sometimes you have to put up with policies you don't like. I wish my gym didn't allow full nudity in the locker room. Okay, seeing these old guys walking around naked feels almost passive-aggressive. But I deal with it. 'cause it's policy. See what I mean? - Nope. - Nudity makes me uncomfortable. - Okay. - My gym allows it. I wish they didn't, but it's policy. So I respect it, and I just-- keep a low--you know, I look away. Think about your commission cap as a naked old man in a gym locker room. - Excuse me, everyone. Sex! Now that I have your attention - you don't have our attention. - Money! - I'm listening. - You had me at "sex." - Pervert. - You have all of our attention just by screaming anything. - That's good to know. [screams] - What do you want to say, Michael? - Wuphf! All right, I've warmed them up for you. You have the floor, Ryan. - How's everybody doing? - Whoo! - Good! Now, a lot of you have already staked out your corner of the wuphf empire. Raise your hand if I'm describing you. Great. - Yes, I have a dream. And It's not some m.L.K. Dream for equality. I want to own a decommissioned lighthouse. And I want to live at the top. And nobody knows I live there. And there's a button that I can press, and it'll launch that lighthouse into space. - For my current Investors, things are going great. - We already have a buyer. - Really? Who? - Washington university. I don't even want to think about selling until our numbers get into the billions. - At least. - So I've decided to open up a second round of investment to friends and family. - Oh, god. Hold on to your wallets, ladies. - Did you ever think of wuphf as an EMERGENCY notification system, like, for college campuses with shooters or gas leaks? - No, no--Oscar, it's not-- it's not a digital rape whistle. Wuphf is about fun. - That's right. - Fun, communication, connection. - What's your money situation? - Well, it's tight, as with any start-up. - Sure, how long can you sustain this without a cash infusion? - We have nine solid days. I love these questions. Keep 'em coming. - I'm sorry, nine days until what? - Bankruptcy? - Wait, Ryan, so this could be over by the weekend? - How long do you think a week is? - No, not this weekend; next weekend. We were gonna go on the investors ski trip. I bought poles. - Well, since I have no incentive to sell, I've cleaned my car, organized my desk, and taken a multivitamin. So what now? Pam. [sighs] Okay, now I've tried everything. - Did you prank Dwight? - No. - Well, you like that. - Yeah, it's not as fun if I'm not blowing off work. - I love you, but I'm kinda busy, so I need you to figure this one out on your own. - [blows raspberry] - [chuckling] - Oscar said Wuphf only has enough money for nine days. - Check this out. - All that color. - Look at that. Triple your investment by January. - Anyone can just throw numbers up on a chart. What are you doing to make it happen? - Well, earlier today, I was emailing someone by the name of John legend. - There you go. - You have his email? - A lot of these guys are just Mac.Com, @ their website whatever. We get that guy wuphfing, it's all over. - I want my money back. - Do not talk like that, Stanley. - Ryan, just tell us your plan. - Okay, all right. I know what you wanna see. I'll be right back. [smacking door] Hey, kids, was that fun? - [all] Yeah! - All right. - I wanna go on it again. - Oh, I bet you do. You know what? When I was a little kid, they couldn't get me off the hayride. But it's gonna cost you three more bucks. Wow! This brings back memories. [inhales deeply] Hay stacking, hay throwing and at the end of it all, one lucky boy would be crowned hay king. I always wanted to be hay king. The world shines on Mose. - Where have you been? I've been waiting. - Uh, can we move this to the end of the day? - No, I--I think you should make time for it. - I found the needle in the haystack! - Hey, congratulations. Do you know what your prize is? - I don't know. - Nothing. Life lesson? Some tasks are not worth doing. - Dwight? - Wuphf T-shirts. Who wants one? Just imagine that you're at spring break daytona beach. - Here we go. - Okay? Everyone's like, "hey dude, what's up with all the hotties in the wuphf shirts?" Or, Uh, "hey, what's up with that helicopter?" "It's ry from wuphf!" - "It's Ryan the wuphf guy!" - "Yo, ry from wuphf!" - "He's up there." - "What's he dropping?" "Wow, what's falling on us, man?" Wuphf condoms! out of the sky. - Look at that! He threw 'em on the ground! - Look, this is a marketing campaign. You got nine days. Let's say you do get the money. What are you going to do with it? - The first lesson of silicon valley, actually, is that you only think about the user, the experience. You actually don't think about the money. Ever. - That sounds weird. - No, it's not weird, Andy, and you know what else? We have an offer from Washington university. So monetize that. - Are you guys meeting about wuphf? You know that that was my idea, right? - [gasps] - I said to Ryan, "I try to call you, "and you don't have your phone. "I try to I.M. You, and you're not online. "I wish there was a way that I could do everything all at once, "and I could just be like this little dog going, 'Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff!'" - baby, baby, baby-- - I think I'm gonna stay here. - No, no, no, no, no. - I do, I do. This isn't right. - I help you with your things, and you help me with my things. - But I--it's not right. - [whIspering] I got this, it's okay, don't worry about this. - Is it any particular branch of Washington university? - The Washington university Public health fund. - W.U.P.H.F. - Oh, god. - They only want it for the initials. - The domain name. Yeah, they do. - I move we sell. - What? - Yeah, sell. - Sell. - Get us out of this. - Have some faith in this idea. - If everybody wants to sell, we sell, right? - I won't sell. And you know what? Ryan and I have the majority of shares. Isn't that right? - Yes. You alone do, actually. - I--yes. We're not selling. I will not sell. [children laughing] - Awesome. - Do you mind if we share this bale? - Sure. - There's no charge to sit on the hay, is there? - Probably. - I mean, wouldn't you think the Ten dollars to build your own Broom would include the hay and not just the instructions? - Mm-hmm. - I mean, I'm starting to think this guy is just trying to make money off the holiday. - Yeah, instead of hay place it should be pay place. - [laughs] - Don't laugh at me. - No, no, no, I wasn't-- I was just laughing at your joke. - Oh. - Pay place. - Mm. Yeah, so we can celebrate Thanksgiving-me-your-money day. - [laughs] That's humorous. - Thank you. - You guys know how to get out? [kids shouting] - Hi, Michael. - Can't talk, saving the planet. - Oh, we don't recycle. - We don't? Well, why have I been separating the trash into Whites and colors? - I'm sure no one asked you to do that. - Eight years. - Listen, I know you really like Ryan-- - no, I won't even consider it. - Michael, I I hate to say this, but You know this special bond that you've always felt with Ryan, where, like, you're best friends or you're his mentor or something? - Right, Yes, yeah. Best friend/mentor. - Michael, I think that that feeling only goes one way. And I think that Ryan knows that, and he's taking advantage of you. - I think you are wrong. - And there are a lot of other people in This office who have money at stake. Other people you care about. - You may be right. I may be crazy. - Don't. - I'm just saying that I think I agree with your point. - Yeah, but in a jokey way where you're gonna start singing. - I thought it might make me feel better. - Okay. Go ahead. -  But it just may be a lunatic  no. - Ooh, nice, wasting time, here we go. - Hey, back off. It's solitaire. - Hey, kid-- hear you're looking for work. - Talk to me. - How far can you reach those Lovely long arms of yours? Eh, put 'em down. How long can you hold that pretty little breath of yours? - [inhales] - Good. - Hey, Jim? Are you distracting these people? - We're working. - Can you at least try to look busy? - [exhales] - The moment Darla put the cupcake in her mouth, her daddy pulled her aside and said, "you're too fat. No one's gonna like you if you're too fat." The next time I saw David Geffen was at the buffalo club. "I love you, you gay bastard," I said. "You gay bastard," I s-- "gay ba--" "gay B--" - Michael, how's it going, bro? - Good, good, bro. - Hey, thanks so much for having my back out there. - Always have your back. So any ideas on how we can get over this nine-day hump here? - I have nothing but ideas. The thing is, they all require money. - Nine days, though. That's, like - look, I know I've tapped you so hard. - Yes, you have tapped this. Hard. - [laughs] Oh, you are funny, Michael. You--people--people don't give you enough credit. - Maybe I could take a second mortgage on my condo. - Well, a lot of people are doing that. And there don't seem to be any consequences. And they say the rates have never been lower. - So you would think that's a good idea for me to do? - Think about this: You and me on a private plane flown by our private pilot-- - Mm-hmm. - Eating our private meal cooked by our private chef. - Yeah, well, we never even have dinner now, so - we totally should. - Tonight? - I gotta work on this. - Oh, right. What am I saying? Rain check. - Yeah. - And now, by show of applause, we will crown this year's hay king. All in favor of purebred. [applause] Put your hands together for mixed bread. [applause] And Let's hear it for purebred. [applause] Mm. It would appear we have a three-way tie. I have no choice but to pick the hay king myself. I pick me! I am your hay king! All Hail your hay king! Did I truck 300 Bales of hay to a parking lot to rectify some childhood disappointment? Yes. - So if I were to call dunder Mifflin and ask for miss Angela Martin, would I get through to you? - You would. And if I were to call your House and ask for your wife, would I get through to you? - My wife passed away a few years ago. - How tragic. Very sorry to hear that. - Thank you. - Help! Hello? Oh! Help! - Consider it a wuphf in person. - You're doing the wrong thing. You're gonna lose Michael's investment, you're gonna lose ours. - You got this crazy opportunity to get our money back. Tell Mike to sell. - If you tell Michael to sell, he'll sell. - I'm betting on myself. - It's a bad bet. - Hello. - Hey. It's an ambush here. Nobody here believes in this company. Will you tell them they're wrong? - It's not that we don't believe in the company. We don't believe in you. - All those in favor of selling, say aye. - Aye. - Aye. - Aye. - Aye. - Aye. Do not agree to sell, which is to say nay. - What is wrong with you? What happened to you in high school? - Michael, are you that blind? - I'm not blind! I know exactly who he is. He is selfish and lazy and image-obsessed, and he is a bad friend. And he's also clever. And he shoots incredibly high. And he may just make it. But you know what, even If he doesn't, I would rather go broke betting on my people than get rich all by myself on some island like a castaway. And there is no middle ground. - You're gonna lose all of our money. - Only If he fails. And you know what? Ryan, I believe in you. Just like I believe in all of you. You have nine days to save Everybody's money. - Oh that's a lot of pressure. I--I'm gonna need some more time. - You can't have it. - Okay. I won't let you down. - Angela? Angela! - The world sends people your way Ryan came to me through a temp agency. Andy was transferred here. No idea where Creed came from. The point is you just have to play with the cards that you're dealt. Jim, that guy is an ace. Dwight is my king Up my sleeve. Phyllis is my old maid. Oscar is my queen. That's easy. Gimme a hard one. That's what Oscar said. Toby is the instruction card you throw away. Pam's a solid seven. And Yeah, you know what? Ryan is probably, like, a two. But sometimes twos can be wild. So watch out. And I am obviously the joker. So [phone rings] [phone rings] that's, uh-- [melodic tone] [robotic voice] - wuphf from Ryan Howard. Decided to sell company. Thanks, bro. Hell of a ride. - Thank god. [phone rings] - Gabe Lewis. - Now, listen here, gabe, you're too fat. No one's gonna like you if you're too fat. I made some changes to my book. See if you like them. - Well, jo-- - now, I love reading, and I hate being interrupted. Shut up and listen, you gay bastard. Chapter one. I was born, not into luxury Nor poverty, but into adversity, and for that, I thank the lord. My father was a man. That's all we can know. After I learned to ride a bike, there was no stopping me. I would ride up Magnolia Street and down azalea Lane. Which would later become my-- - All right, good night, gabe. Just wanted to say thanks again, 'cause I really think I made good use of my day, oh! Sorry. - And fate has obliged me with plenty of battles, the first being a hard--   Why? That's all it takes. all feet, no hands and I'll have the pededexterity of a chimp and you'll be sitting there like an idiot. Okay, here we go. Ah, yes. - Do you mind? - I'm sorry, Pam. Allow me to write you an apology letter. You don't have to do that. - D-e-a oops, space, "a. Dear" thank you, hands. Nothing else in the universe can do what you do. Oh, don't worry about it. Dwight, it's okay. You were wrong. It's so hot. Well, "a" for effort, right? Welcome. Start your morning right with a burst of blueberry or try plain. What's the occasion? Dwight said this entry was a waste of space. I would like Du blueberry, por favor. - $8. - $8? Owning a building is a war between the landlord and the tenant. Not a literal war, unfortunately. But I am using the same tactics. I have surrounded the enemy and I'm slowly starving them. To save on electricity, I have installed a timer and motion censors on the lights. It's part of my green initiative. And by green, I mean money. - Mm-hmm. China. China. Michael, how was the dentist? It was great. China. Are you okay? What's wrong? Everything here was made in China, Pam. Yeah, that's where they make stuff. They used to make stuff in America, Andy, but we're falling behind. Did you know that? China is a sleeping dragon that is just beginning to stir. - Oh, no. - Yeah. Right here. It is right there. Anybody read the news anymore? China is on the move. I found that in the waiting room at the dentist's office. This kid had the magazine I wanted to read. That's the only one I could reach and I read it and then I read it again. My whole life I believed that America was number one. That was the saying. Not America's number two. England is number two. China should be like eight. Hey, Andy. Hey, Darryl. You gotta stop texting me so much. But I wanted you to know that Michael and I are wearing the same tie today. It's insane. You need to change your standard for what's worthy of a text. Ask yourself, "is this something Darryl needs to know?" The answer's almost always "no." Got it. Then I will call you. No. There was a time when the only people who texted you were people you wanted to text you. Girls. And they'd all say the same thing. "I'm comin' over, baby." And I would text back. "B.T.B." Bring that Booty. Dwight. Why is the toilet paper only half a ply? Oh, I'm sorry. Is that not good enough for your anus? Don't get me started on how coddled the modern anus is. Okay, um, Stanley, maybe you can just unspool a little more each time you need to don't tell me how to do my business. Stanley, as a fellow dunder Mifflin employee I feel for you, but like you, I am completely powerless to the whims of the new building owner. Which is you. "Which is you" is not a sentence. I disagree with. Are you gonna just sit there office administrator or are you gonna do something? Dwight, can we talk about these cut backs? Pam, when I'm sitting at this desk, I'm a salesman. If you wanna talk to the new building owner, you should call Nate and schedule an appointment. I'm not gonna do that. Well, then you're not going to talk to new building owner, which is a shame, because I hear he's a very reasonable guy. Y'ello? Hi, Nate. It's Pam Halpert. Oh, hey, Pam. Hey, I would just love to schedule a meeting today with Dwight. Let me just put you on hold st for one eensy second. Sure. - Dwight Schrute. -Hmm. Tell her I'm busy. I don't know. Make something up. Hey, Pam, Dwight's being questioned by the police in a connection with a string of dognappings that have been Dwight. Dwight, can you please tell new building owner that he is screwing over all the people he works with. People he's worked with for ars. His friends. You know what, Pam? You're right. This isn't just a business, this is a home. And I would much rather see a smile from Kevin than save hundreds on plumbing and electricity. Oh, my God. What? According to the Internet the tallest man in the world is Chinese. So much for keeping our secrets up high. What's America gonna do? I know what we're gonna do. We're gonna put our best minds on it. Everybody, stop working. I want you all to imagine a world in which America is not the number-one super power. Where forks are irrelevant. And where every man, woman and child is expected to learn how to play the cello. Now, open your eyes. You never told us to close them. Welcome to your future. What do we do? How do we stop this? How do we stop it? With a big idea. That's what America is built on. Big ideas, blue jeans, the grand canyon. Who's got one? Who's got a big idea? An idea bigger than the grand canyon? Yes, indeed. Yes, Kevin. An antacid that you only take once a week. - Once-a-week antacid is the idea to beat. Anyone else? Nobody? Okay, then, we are - Michael. - Yes. An acid pill that you take once every six weeks. Why not go just one for the year? I don't know. It's too big a pill to swallow. All right. What if we all get together and help each other and hire a new guy and then we all kill him but first we take out, like, a $100,000 life insurance policy? I bet you guys like that idea, don't you? I think that's what they're doing to me. I can't prove it, but I wanted to see their faces when I said it. I learned nothing. I don't know what the *** that was. I say we bomb 'em. By 2020 they're gonna be the world's largest economy and they're getting a taste r protein. We'll all starve. Yeah, Dwight's right, we should drop the bomb. No, he's not we're not where would we even drop it, Phyllis? Did you know that in China there are 56 cities with over a million people? You know how many we have here? Nine. Actually, that's not true. I know the figure you're referring to and it's a projection of 15 years from now. Thank God. No. No, that is right now. Michael, China's agrarian. Urbanizing fast? You betcha. But still agrarian. Most in terms of land not population. Come on, Michael, you couldn't no! No, you're wrong about this. Where are you getting this information? I got it from New York times dot com. - Uh-oh. Getting nervous, Oscar? Okay, someone look it up. I'm on it, Jim. I'm on it. Guys, it's not worth it. Really. Guys this is not worth our time. "Are you watching this?" Seriously? Well, are you? I'm sittin' right here. Got it. China has 56 cities with a population of over one million. The U.S. has nine. Suck it, Oscar. Well, on the plus side all this worrying about China has made you smarter than Oscar, Michael. Great, I was wrong. I'm wrong. Is everyone happy? So I happen to know more than the smartest guy in the office. So what? I don't care. Okay, now, where were we before I bested Oscar? Wow, so this building can get uglier. I will not work in a roach billboard. Oh, my God. I can't look at roaches. Michael, do something about this. Absolutely. Pam, this is exactly why I hired you as office administrator. Handle it. Takin' care of business. Dwight, take it down. I'm serious. Take it down or else. Or else. Or else what? There's nothing you can do. We can move out. Uh. Really? So does anyone wanna know where I've been for the last two hours? Oh, my God, I've been playing zombie soccer for two hours? I went out to look for a better office space. Waste of time. Not really, because I found one. Oh, wow. These are nice. Yep. Let me see. Look at the huge offices, Jim. Yeah, I know. Check out that conference room. - Totally. - You can't just move out. Oh, in three months we can. Check the lease. And if you don't undo all the changes you've made, we're moving. Hey, guys, can I show you some pictures? Oh, my gosh, she's so cute. She looks like both of you. - They're not of Cece. - Oh, cool. This is possibly our new dunder Mifflin office. Well, I like being in the same building as Bob. It keeps me honest. This building isn't far and it's much newer. There's a dry cleaner, a nail place and a gym. Oh, and it's next door to an outback so it always smells like steak. Are you trying to kill me? Is the nail place Koreans or whites? Koreans. Good. And the dry cleaners? White? Good. Whoa, there's a lot of brain power in this room. We got Michael and Oscar, the two smartest guys in the office. Also, in that order. Funny. Jim, that is funny. Very comedically humorous, Jim. I have a computer question. Hey, Oscar? What is it? Can you move aside so that I can ask Michael? All right. All right, I get it. Michael, how do I create a new tab? Try control "p". That's print. Not if the printer isn't hooked up. You're making some very dangerous assumptions, Oscar. Oscar, it must be killing you now that Michael is smarter than you. He's he's not smarter than me. He was just right about one thing. Yeah, but it was really a smart thing to be right about, actually. Actually, it was. Around here Oscar is known as "actually" because he will insert himself into just about any conversation to add facts or correct grammar. Actually, you're speculating. He really does fit that old stereotype of the smug gay Mexican. "Megan fox. Question mark." What's that mean? Meagan fox. Come on. You know what? You're one bad text away from gettin' blocked. Yes, but one good text away from a high five. You accept these terms? Oh, it's on. In your perfect world what would make this building awesome? I'm putting together kind of a wish list. I wish for a million wishes. Yeah, no, I'm not a genie. I'm just talking about Then see you later, building. You can't possibly be serious. I said see you later, building. - Hey, Michael. - Hey. I was thinking about some of the stuff you said earlier about China. I'd love to talk more about it. Yeah. - Maybe over some coffee later? - Sure. Do you know what you just agreed to? - Just coffee, Jim. - No, it's not just coffee. He's trying to set you up, Michael. What's gonna happen is he's gonna try to bring up whatever you're talking about in a very casual way. But secretly he'll be trying to trip you up. And when he does, boom, it's awful. Haven't you noticed that I don't bring up the tour de France around him? Yes. And then, he will smugly pay the check and make you feel so small. All right, well, I just need to learn everything about China. To be safe I should learn everything about everything but I don't have time. Okay. Okay, I'll just learn about China and science and geography and math and literary. No politics? I'm pretty good on politics. California is bankrupt. And California, California. What? Parlay. My office. Five minutes. Parlay? Pirate code. He wants to meet. So everyone here knows pirate code? I understand it. I can't speak it. Pam, I am not an unreasonable man. If you guys stay, I will stop watering down the soap. You've been watering down the soap? Why do you even need soap? Are you that bad at going to the bathroom? We want everything back the way it was. You don't wanna move. Moving is one of the most stressful things you can do in life. You'll probably just take it out on your kid. Jim will turn to the drink. The family will fall apart. And 25 years from now, Cece will become world famous for stripping. That's a sad story. I have another one. We move, the other tenants follow, the banks takes the building, takes your farm, takes your car and beats the crap out of you. Penniless, you die. And my daughter, Cece, dances on your grave fully clothed. Where is Tibet? Pass. - When was China founded? - Pass. Two for two. Keep it up. Who is mao? - Life line. - Damn it, Michael. You are moments away from the smack down of your life. If you don't know something, steer the conversation back to something you do know. I could talk about boobs. I bet he knows nothing about boobs. What do you know about boobs? Michael, I have to tell you something. It's from rocky ii. Thank you. This guy doesn't just wanna win, you know, he wants to burry you. He wants to humiliate you. Wait, wait, wait. How long is this gonna take? I'm like a quarter of the way through. Is it gonna be worth it? No. Just in case, Michael, I made you a cheat sheet. I don't need to cheat. Show him how to use it. Here it is right here. Pull over. Pull over. Oh, my God. No way. Man, look at that. Yeah. There's no building. This can only mean one thing. - Building's underground. - She was lying. Oh, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam. - Yeah. - Pam? - What? - I'm Pam. - Oh. - No, you're not. I'm sorry, we have a colleague with the same name. Oh, oh, that's funny. You're not a liar too, are you? I've been known to bend the truth. Damn it, Pam. Get out. Right now. Leave it. I mean it. Get the hell out of here. Go! I can't wait to do to Pam what I just did to Pam. - Pam? - Yeah. You know, I'm the only one here that you haven't asked about the new office. I know. Because you're the reason we're moving. Yeah, but I'm still an employee here, and that part of me is really excited about the change of scenery. What's the square footage in the new place? Uh, I think it's something like, um What's the exact square footage? Um, let me see. How many offices are there? - Oh, I'll just look at the one-sheet myself. - Uh, actually I don't know what I did with the one-sheet. You know, that's the problem. You only have one sheet. Oh, you're a funny guy, Pam. What's the first thing you guys are gonna do when you move in to the new office? I'm gonna walk down the hall and I'm gonna say, "wow, I can't believe this is real, but it is." I can't wait. I lied about some aspects of the building. It's still on a bike path, though, right? There's no building. It doesn't exist. What does that mean? I needed leverage, so I pulled those pictures off the Internet. It's just this this office administrator thing, I don't want to What? Fail. I don't want to fail. Again. You didn't fail. That's what you said about art school and that's what you said about sales. And you didn't fail those things either. Well, I'm not an artist, and I'm not a salesman. So what would you call it? Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Michael, the reason I asked you down here for this chat is I've been thinking that your fears about China are a bit exaggerated. Did you know that China has a new missile that can sink a U.S. naval carrier We have missiles too. Did you also know that China has secretly been expanding its nuclear arsenal? But what do I know? I mean, that's just according to the Pentagon. Our Pentagon. I wasn't here. What? I wasn't here. It's a pretty common saying. You may want to log it away for future use. Well, thanks. Yeah. China has been loaning us billions upon billions of dollars. We are going to be owing them for the rest of our lives, and they will control us. Actually, we're in a mild recession right now, I'll give you that, but people use China as the boogeyman for all their problems. In the 1980s, it was Japan. How then do you explain that in the past year manufacturing in China has risen by 17%, and in the U.S. It has only risen by 8%? Do you really think that manufacturing is a relevant indicator of where the world economy's heading in 2010? Do you know the comparative expansion of, say, the information sector? I'd say that's far more relevant. Wouldn't you? Don't I Hello. Hello. You're breaking the law. Impossible. I love the law. Read article 19. There are certain standards that you have to maintain the building at and that includes comfortable temperatures and adequate lighting. It also means no more cutting the tampons in two and no more tampering with the toilet paper. I see I've underestimated you and I didn't think that was possible. Nate. Re-ply the paper. I don't think it goes that way. - Re-ply it! Don't worry about the coffee. It's on me. Yeah, I figured that. Michael, I am so happy that we were able to have this little chat. Wait. You forgetting something? - What? - This chat. Two men. One white. One Latino. A boss and a money cruncher. I could fire you. Fire him. No. Show mercy. But here we are. What is your point? My point is That as long as people like you and me don't stop talking Nobody can stop the U.S.A. - Yeah, go, girl. - Right. Yes. - I am talking about freedom. - Mm-hmm. About choice. America I don't think you need to worry, because if you want to be China, you will. If you don't, that's fine. That, my friend, is your victory. You know, a lot of people say that if you dig long enough and hard enough you will get to China and that may be true, but what they don't tell you is that if you dig long enough and hard enough in a conversation, you get to a friend. So here is to conversation. Raise you cups on high. Case closed. Yeah! That wasn't what we were discu that wasn't the whole they say the best vampires don't bleed their victims dry, but give them the strength so that they can bounce back only to be fed on again. I spared Pam and I might feast off of her profits for years to come. I let Pam win. I was not motivated by compassion. I have no compassion. Make sure you got that. "Not motivated by compassion." Come to parking lot. Crazy pigeon action. You're gonna scare them away. - *** - Yeah, right? That's a new standard. Got it. Okay, let's go. I'm freezing. People, wait, wait, wait. Come back, come back. One fun one. We're gonna do a fun one. One Charlie's angels. One. Let's go. Okay, this is just a Christmas card from your paper supplier. No one's putting this on their fridge. Ooh, I got it, you guys, how 'bout this Michael, what if all the boys are on one side, all the girls are on the other. The boys are, like, "why, I oughta," and the girls are, like, "let's go shopping"? Let's just jump in the air. That's it! That's a picture! Yes! Jump in the air. We're gonna jump in the air. - Here we go. - Okay, one TwoThree Not everyone jumped. Okay, everybody jump in the air this time, please. Here we go. One, two, three. Still some people not jumping. You gotta be kidding me. Who isn't jumping? I'll tell you who. Darryl, Phyllis, Stanley, - Angela, and Oscar. - I am jumping. You are? Let me see you jump. Oh, my God. This is a store-bought camera. This isn't one of those special military-grade cameras that would be able to capture that. I'm freezing. Um, also, Erin is jumping way too early. She's on the ground by "three." I didn't want to miss it. Well, if we all jump really high, we'll be in the air longer. Do that. Here's a question nobody's asking - Is this worth it? - Don't answer that. People, listen up and listen good. We need to just get one picture where we're all in the air at the same time. Yes? - Why? - I believe in us. - We can do this. - Okay, on three, everyone in the air. Three, two, one, zero. We didn't get it. I'm the office administrator now, which means I'm basically being paid to be head of the party planning committee. The first thing I did as head I shut it down. At its worst it was a toxic political club used to make others feel miserable and left out. At its best it planned parties. It hardly looks fake. It's so lush. Why does it smell real? AhGood one. Oh, ho, ho, ho! Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas, little children! Merry Christmas. How's everybody doing today? - Good. - Good. How's the party coming along? - Great. - Are we over budget? - Nope. - No? Good. Did anyone get drunk already? Not yet. Good for you. Angela, lay it on me What's the problem? Nothing. Should be fun. So, Stanley, how big is the bug up your butt today? Pam got those sugar-free cookies I like. I'm doing fine. All right, well, I will be in my office making toys for the good children. Andy? - Yeah? - What you got? It's all good, Santa. Well, that's a relief. Santa's gonna take some much-needed free time. All right. Good! My kids are growing up. As a boss, I look at that and I say great. It is exactly what a boss would hope would happen because that's what I want. That's what every boss wants, is a is a wonderful Christmas with no drama. It's present time, you guys. Happy holidays from your friends at Sabre. We just want to say how grateful we are. Sabre is actively looking for ways to involve me as minority executive trainee. So I suggested choosing the annual Christmas gift to the employees. And they said, "oh, yes. Perfect. Thank you, Kelly. Finally, something for you to do." It's a hello kitty laptop sleeve. Hello kitty's for girls. Nashua got mp3 players. Yeah, I don't even have a laptop. I wonder if these presents would be under as much scrutiny if I were white. - Wow - Come on. I said "I wonder." I didn't say "I think." Kelly, I thought we agreed on fleece blankets. Blankets? What am I, five? Erin and I make great use of ours. Yes, Erin and I are still dating. Why do you ask me so often if we're still dating? I'll take one of those pink pouches. I feel good today. My little girl Jada? It's my turn to have her for Christmas this year. Two years ago I had her, and we had the best time. I TiVoed her favorite shows, some things I've never heard of. iCarly You know who's funny on that show? The friend with the video camera. He's got a nice way of talking. Hey, it's snowing. Oh, my God! It's the first snowfall of Christmas. Is that just so magical for you, little girl? Can you not wait to have a hot chocolate, and cuddle up with papa and tell him about all your Christmas dreams, hmm? It's not even a real snow. Look, it's a dusting. Pitiful. Hey, Dwight. Whoo! Damn it, Jim, you cannot throw snowballs in here! Well, it's not a snowball, 'cause it's only a dusting. Right? Look at that. There's a pebble in there. You could have killed me! Oh, don't be such a baby. Yeah, who's a little girl now? You apologize to me right now. You've got something on your nose. You apologize right now. - No. - Very well, then I challenge you to a snowball fight on the first real snow of winter. You got it. That sounds awesome. Can we all do it? No, Andy, it's a snowball fight. It's not fun. Go get your own thing. Beat it. Jim, let go. Let go. Angela, are you bringing your new boyfriend to the party? I wouldn't subject Robert to that. He's a very busy senator. State senator. I would not expect you to know what it's like to date someone in the public arena. Who are you dating in the public arena? The senator. Oh, right. The state senator. We went to a picnic thrown my the comptroller's wife. Oh, that would be impressive If anyone knew what a comptroller was. Well Do you have any idea how many photographers there are at a ribbon-cutting ceremony? I do. Two. "Angela" "Over here, Angela" "Here. Look here!" Before we kick off the party, I just want to remind everyone that an office party is just that - Yeah! - A party. It's not an excuse to get really drunk or confront someone or have a cathartic experience - of any kind. - Pam? - Pam? - Pam? Wow, there are questions to that. Okay. Um, you know what, no questions. Last item on the agenda, Toby would like to make an announcement. - Hi, guys. - Hi. I just wanted to let you know that I'll be taking a leave of absence starting next week. Because you've been on the lam? Because the "boring police" have been after you, and they finally caught up with you? No, the opposite. I was actually selected to be a juror on a very high-profile case. Yes, the case of the horrible red-headed sad sack. And the verdict it was Toby. And the sentence, death. Death to Toby! Death to Toby! Okay, that's hurtful talk. We've talked about that. You know, I don't interrupt your announcements. You leave these huge pauses in your sentences. - What do you expect me to do? - What's the case, Toby? Well, I really can't talk about it, but it's a very high-profile case. - Is it criminal? - Yes. - Have we heard of it? - I don't know. Is it the middle school teacher who tried to turn her foreign exchange student into a sex slave? - Come on. - Was it the post office guy who rubbed his penis all over the mail? Guys, it's a really big deal. He's rubbing his neck. He's rubbing his neck! - He's rubbing his neck. - Oh, Scranton strangler! I can neither confirm nor deny this. Let's just say I'll be up to my neck in jury duty. That was the worst joke ever. Corporate will be sending someone else to take my place. Okay, good-bye. Good-bye. Uh, Holly flax She comes from the Nashua branch. What? What? Yeah, she'll be starting next week. If you have any questions about the transition, just let me know. Hold on, Holly's coming back here? - Yeah. - Guys, who's Holly? That is a great question, Erin. How do you describe somebody who is at the same time an old friend, and was a lover And was a complicated part of my past, and maybe, just maybe - a part of my future? - Wow. She's one sassy black lady. Holly's coming back, everybody, and we have to have a party. I'm not sure the temporary replacement of an hr rep really warrants a party. You know what, we'll postpone this party until then. This is too important. Cancel this one. - Dwight, get rid of the tree. - Okay. Cancel. We're canceling it. - No, don't throw them out! - No, we have to cancel - We can save that. - No, no, no. We're gonna get fresh for Holly. - I bought these. - These cookies are fine! They're not. Fresh and new. Michael, wait. We don't have We don't have the budget for another party. Well, then, everybody will chip in It'll be fine. I honestly think you're idealizing people here again, Michael. I don't think that's gonna happen. You know what, I'll pay for it. I'll pay for the party. This is way too important. People, Holly's coming back, and this is the most important Christmas party of my life. - So back to work. - Oh, boy. Man, I worked hard. I worked so hard for this! I was after corporate constantly. I emailed Joe. I wrote letters. And you know who I end up owing this to is the Scranton strangler. Thank you. Thank you, Scranton strangler. I love you! You just took one more person's breath away. We have always had good Christmas parties here, as you know, but they've never been cool. The name is bondSanta bond. I'll have an eggnog, shaken, not stirred. Classic Brosnan. SantaWonderful tradition. Everybody loves Santa. Everybody can't get enough of the jolly old man. But that is a myth, because you know what, he is not necessarily a big fat guy with a beard. He's not necessarily an old guy. No one knows what the real Santa Claus God! Ow! Just stop moving your calves so much while you're talking. Well, this year's gonna be different. We're gonna have fun. It's not gonna be tacky. It's going to be You know what, the food is going to be austere. It is not going to be tacky, deli platter food. It's not gonna have a big, fat, gross Santa Claus. It's gonna be a cool, sleek Santa. Maybe I'll bring my boyfriend. - I'll invite him. - Okay. Sure. I mean, unless there's any chance there could be *pss at this party. You never know about the press. Well, I only ask because he's a senator. Could he help us with some parking tickets? I don't think that's appropriate. Well, then he's not a senator. - Yes, he is. - Okay. - Hey. - Hey. We still doing the gifts today? I mean, it is the Christmas party. Well, the classy Christmas party. Yes. But don't get too excited, 'cause I didn't have a lot of time this year. - Me neither. Whew. - Okay. I've been working forever on Jim's present. He always gives me the best Christmas gifts. He'll take a memory or a private joke, and he'll create something totally unique. I love them. So this year I made him something. A comic book. It stars Jimmy Halpert, a mild-mannered paper salesman who, while riding his bike through the forest, is bitten by a radioactive bear becomes a "bear man." Wreaks havoc on the office. It's really good. Okay Oh, no, no, no, no! Fake tree. No! - No, it has the little - Pam, no, no. Holly's coming from new Hampshire. Somebody from new Hampshire looks at that and thinks it's a burning cross. No, no. I want you to go and get a real tree. Take some money. Thank you. Hi, I'm looking for Michael Scott. Yes, that's me. Come on in. There's nothing classier than boring jazz music, I am here to tell ya. And I made a bit of a judgment call. I hired one musician, because I thought, what's better, to hire an entire quartet for half an hour, or one bassist for the entire day?   Hey, any volunteers to come with me to go buy a Christmas tree? I would, but I don't want to get dirty. There might be girls at the party. Why do you always think that girls are gonna be at the party? No one invited girls. It's just us. I will help. Although my 'bridMy hybrid My Prius hybrid, won't fit a tree. Which is ironic, considering how many trees it saves - on a daily basis. - Yeah. I do, however, have a hookup with a dude who has a pickup. Oh, do you mean Darryl? That's a great idea. - I'll ask him. - You know Darryl? Yeah. He works here. We all know him. I should come along, just 'cause he's my You know, he's my hookup. Cool. Come on, now, Justine, look Listen Look, I've been planning this, okay? - You cannot do this, Justine. - I'm not doing it! She told me she wants to have Christmas here. - She did? - Yes. She wants to be around family for Christmas. I don't know I thought I was enough family for my daughter. Don't come in, I'm busy. It's cool, Darryl, I'm here too. Hey, sorry, I really didn't want to come in. It's just that we have to go buy a new Christmas tree, and we're hoping we could borrow your truck. Uh, no. Come on, it'll be fun. We could do doughnuts in the snow on the way back. No. Thank you for your interest in my truck. Okay. Sorry. We'll leave you ale. Hey [Sighs you know what, I could use a breath of fresh air. Let's do it. When Holly gets here, I want you to be very helpful to her. I've looked her up online There's nothing about her. She's made no impression on the Internet. She doesn't need an Internet presence You just know. Oh - Hey. - Hi. What the hell are you doing here? You're supposed to be in the courthouse. We're on recess. I came for the party. Hi. - Hey, everyone. - Hi, Toby. What does the strangler look like? Is he gorgeous? He looks gorgeous in the drawings. - Yeah. - That scowl. I can't talk about it or I'll get removed from the jury. And then he will come back here and replace Holly, so stop asking him questions. I know people are only this excited to talk to me because of the trial. But they talk to me for a while, and maybe people realize I have something to say. And then one day, we're just talking. You've reached the voice mail of Dwight Kurt Schrute. Please leave Raaaaugh! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Stop! OhOh! I have no feeling in my fingers or penis. But I think it was worth it. Aah! Um, I was laying on the ground, defenseless, and he just kept throwing 'em until he exhausted himself. And, uhThen "How 'bout icing it? Lol. Dwight." - Hi. - Hello. Is there any way I can get a hand with these, please? I'm really sorry, I can't help you. I'm waiting for my boss' pretty friend to arrive. There she is. Hey. Erin, would you help her, for God's sake? Oh, you're Holly! Of course. Sorry. Hello. Well, well, well, if it isn't Michael Scott. You old bastard. Well, I never thought I'd see your face around these parts, you old bastard! Well, I did show my face around these parts, you old bastard. Why, you're some sorta wise guy, huh? I most certainly am. - Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk, nyuk! - Unnnnnngh! - D'oh! - Oh, Homey. OkayHolly's back. Hi. Hi. Oh, huggy monster! Oh, not the huggy monster! I don't want to die! I don't want to die! I don't want to die! Wow. Well, everybody, - you remember Holly. - Hi. Did you bring us anything from Nashua? Oh, yeah. I brought some maple candy. But I have to admit, I got a little hungry on the drive, - and I ate some of them. - That's adorable. - Would you put those out? - To throw out? Or put out, like, six pieces for everyone? Oh, it's so nice to be back. It looks beautiful in here. Super-classy. It's like a party for limousine drivers. Well, you came on the day of our Christmas party. Oh, it's fabulous. I love what you did! Isn't it wonderful? We love it here. Don't you love it? All right, let me show you to your desk. I show you to your dayyy-esk! Watch out for my guns. They're both loaded. What kind of guns do you have? - Six-shooter? - Aww This is weird. I can't believe you're here. This feels like you never left. - Doesn't it? - Yeah, kind of. Yeah. - Oh, God. - Oh, and you have a Woody. Bah! - OhI love - Aj gave me that. Well, that's understandable. Still raw. - Woody your favorite character? - Mm-hmm. You know who my favorite character in toy story is? - Andy's mom. - Why? Because without Andy's mom, there's no plot. And without any plot, there is no movie. That is a really good point. Aj said he hadn't seen any of the toy story movies. - You're kidding me. - No. I know. I'm going, "what? Are you serious?" - What a douche bag! - Get a life! Get a Yeah. Good riddance. We sat down and we watched them all in one day. Now he's the biggest toy story fanatic ever. - Good for him. - Next day I found him in my bed. Really? That's creepy. How did Aj get in your house? We live together. Oh, you do? He had a little note pinned to him that said, "you've got a friend in me." - Yeah, Randy Newman's the best. - Yeah. - I love him. - Me too.  Christmas tree, Christmas tree   won't you be my Christmas tree?  Hey, how about this one? Ehh, seems a little full of itself, right? Kind of a pretty boy. What if we got a really beat up one, like on Charlie brown. And we just loved it for what it is? Maybe. I mean No, she be talking to your mom or something. This is my daughter too, Justine! You seem to think Oh Pick a damn tree already. Um, hey, Darryl, listen, it's none of my business, but if I couldn't have Cece for Christmas, I'd be really upset too. I don't have kids or anything, but if my grandmother ever dies, I'm going to kill myself. Jada don't want to spend Christmas with me. She told her mom it wasn't as much fun. How could she say that? You know, I took her to the toy store to buy her own presents. Well, Darryl, no kid wants to buy their own Christmas presents. Her mom wants me to take her to mass. I guess that's something to do. No, you should have her mom do the boring Christmas stuff on her time. You should be associated with the fun parts of Christmas. How do I do that? Bring her to the party. Yeah, we'll have Santa, and we'll play games with her. It'll be a lot of fun. Yes! You'll be Mr. Christmas by the end of the night. Hey, guys, the tree's here. - Hey. - Nobody hug me I'm covered in tree sap, so Why would someone hug you? Hey there, Jada. Nice to see you again. I'm Santa Claus. Welcome. Are you serious? It's a sophisticated take. He doesn't look like Santa Claus. No, he doesn't. I told her Santa would be here. Yeah, well, I was told that Holly would be here, single and ready to date. - And we all got misled. - Who told you that? Nora Ephron, in every romantic comedy ever made. So is it an open relationship? Oh, God, no. Well, you're almost 40. Oh, do you not want kids? Oh, I want kids. I really want kids. But Aj and I are practically engaged. We talk about spending our lives together. - So where's the ring? - Kelly! Um, how are you adjusting to the move? Nobody cares about that. Look, you have to make him commit, or kick his butt to the curb. You guys, I don't think any of us are really qualified to be giving Holly personal advice about her love life. Yeah, I mean, maybe Holly's not in any position to be shooing guys away. I don't get it. I'm sorry. I just I don't get it. Okay, listen, I'm gonna tell him that if he doesn't propose by the end of this year, we're over. - Wow, an ultimatum. - Yeah. It doesn't really seem like you. That is a great idea. Ultimatums are key. Basically, nobody does anything for me anymore unless I threaten to kill myself. Don't. Stop Dwight! - Dwight, stop! - Oh, no. Oh, no! - Stop! - Oh, no. - Yes, taste my wrath! - Okay. Okay - You like that? - Seriously! Okay. Okay. Yes, I have a wig for every single person in the office. You never know when you're gonna need to bear a passing resemblance to someone. I just want it to stop. So cool, right? There's no connection between - the origin story and the quest. - Okay. We need to know who Jimmy Halpert was before he was bitten by the bear. Otherwise it's the bear's quest. Okay, well, I just sorta meant, like, cute, right? Well, did you come here for help, or did you come here for me to tell you how great it is? I mean, help, if it's something simple, like add page numbers or laminate it or It sounds like you know what you want. It's also a little derivative of a serial called bear man. Did you look that up? - No. - Okay. - Oh, Jim. Hey. - Hey, Toby. There's this female stenographer at the courthouse - No way. - Who looks exactly like you. - That's incredible. - Yeah. No, it's uncanny. You know what's crazy? I can't reconnect with you right now. Hold on one second. Oh! Excuse me. I guess there are just some people who you stay together with when you transfer, and some people you don't. And that's just the way it is. And I can be mature about that. It's so cold. Even with my coat on. Maybe your senator boyfriend has a blanket in his car for screwing Americans. Yet another opportunity where a blanket would have come in handy. You guys, this has to stop. Someone could have really gotten hurt. What if Meredith was taking her smoking break below that window? You know what would have happened? The shards of glass would have shaved her face right off. And, yes, it might have been funny, but it also would have been incredibly tragic. I could not agree more. And I just want to state for the record that I am intending to sue Jim for acute psychological distress. What are you talking about? You're the one terrorizing me. With snowballs, Jim? With Fluffy little snowballs? No. I thought we were just playing. Dwight's right. What you did was dangerous and inappropriate. Mmm, mmm. Mm-hmm. I'm really surprised at you guys. Last time I was here, you were both best friends. All this arguing reminds me of a very funny story. You see this on my desk? Know who gave me this? My girlfriend Tara, who lives in New York city. - Wait, what girlfriend? - I haven't told you about her. I find that unlikely. You email me when you get a new zit. I'm a man in my mid-40s and I still get zits. I think that's pretty interesting. But you know what, I am not on trial here. The Scranton strangler is. So anyway, we have this great weekend, and she drives me to the airport, and we get to JFK, but I'm flying out of Laguardia. So we laugh and laugh and laugh, and then we spend the rest of the day walking around slomo drinking latte. And at the end of the day, she gives me this, and she says, "Michael, maybe next time, you should take a cab." I didn't know you had a girlfriend. I do. She is. Did you see her face? Well, it seems to me that there is a person sitting out there in the annex that still has feelings for Michael g. Scott. And it ain't Tara. So you went homemade this year. - Yep. - Yeah. Money problems Is that what this is about? I mean, oh, dear, I don't think we can help you out. No, no. Jim had a great year, actually. I just wanted to get your opinion. Are you good at homemade? Look at this. Yeah. Who did this? It's obvious to me I'm not welcome here, but somebody better tell me who did this, or else I'm leaving. Well, I don't think Erin seems to like you. That's not true. I don't know her enough to make a decision even. What happened? What happened? Toby, what did you do? I think Toby's very jealous of all the attention you've been getting. No, I would never ever do anything like that. But it does seem like something you would do. Oh, really? Turn it on me. Well, isn't that nice? Thank you very much. Wait, wait, guys, listen. Toy story is all about toys that come to life when people aren't looking. You don't think It's not possible That Woody did this to himself? It is Christmas. No, it really seems like something Michael would do. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Well, the fact that you would think that points to the possibility that it is probably not me. And that I have been framed. Why would anyone frame you for that? Okay, I'm sorry, why are we discounting this whole "Woody came to life" thing so quickly? AaaaahhAhh, Ahh! Surprise! It was part of the party. - Pretty funny, huh? - You think this is funny? I don't. But someday I think we will laugh about this - When we tell our kids - Yikes. - Oh, my God. - All right! Shh. Okay You know what, Holly, I didn't mean to do it. It was an accident. An accident borne of jealous feelings. Michael, you have to let this go. I'm with someone else. I don't feel that way anymore. Oh, really? Well, you certainly seemed jealous when I told you about my fake girlfriend. That's what Jim and Dwight thought. Okay, hey, hey, hey No, fake girlfriends are always wrong. You made up a fake girlfriend to see if I'd get jealous? And you destroyed a gift my boyfriend gave me? What is the matter with you? When you got transferred, and I drove you up to Nashua, you said, "Michael, I love you, but I can't do this." But then, with this other guy, you don't have any problem with a long-distance relationship, do you? And you know what, that is what is the matter with me. Michael, I'm sorry. And we did this whole stupid party for you. No. You guys, it wasn't my fault. Nothing is ever your fault. Just like when you ate those maple candies that you brought for us! I really think you're better off. Mmm. Erin, would you do me a favor and find my street clothes for me, please? Yeah. Is she an amazing cook or something? "Hey, pickles, Merry Christmas. "Open immediately? Love, Swiss cheese. Damn it, Dwight! Didn't think your affectionate nicknames would be your undoing, did you, Jim? Let that be a lesson to you all. So do they bring in food, or do you get to go out? No, they bring it in. You lucky son of a bitch. I have been trying to get on jury duty every single year since I was 18 years old. To get to go sit in an air-conditioned room downtown, judging people while my lunch is paid for That is the life. Daddy, I'm bored. Can I read my book in your office? Sure, sweetie. Jada, Darryl, I'm so glad I found you guys. A Grinch stole the star from on top of the Christmas tree and is hiding it in the warehouse somewhere. You want to go help me find him? Oh, my goodness.   I am the mean old Grinch. The little girl who wishes to win back the Christmas star must first succeed at these challenges. Ohh, that sounds fun and christmasy, you mean old Grinch. What kind of challenges? Waahhh Something like an obstacle course, Mr. Grinch? No. You must answer topical political question something like an ob"how many congressmeninch? "Is the state of Pennsylvania guaranteed? And what other state has the equal number?" I don't know. Do you know the other state? Maybe the Grinch hid the Christmas star, and we could ask for clues, and he'll tell us if we're hot or cold. The star has been hidden. Is the little girl hot or cold? Well, it turns out she's burning up because the star is right behind her ear! And the game's over seconds later. I'm so glad you could come. It's nice. I know. Hey, everybody, this is my boyfriend, senator Robert Lipton. Hi. Senator, it's an honor. I'm Angela's friend Oscar. Oscar. A pleasure. Robert seems great. He's very handsome, firm handshake, he's gay, good sense of humor. - Hi. - Hello. I'm, uh I'm Aj. I'm here to see Holly. It's kind of a surprise. I know who you are, and I think you should go. I bet you didn't even bring us anything, did you? Was I supposed to bring you guys something? What? Aj! - Surprise. - What are you doing here? - Oh, my God. - I wanted to see you. - How are you? - Wow! Nice. - Oh, God, you look great. - Oh When did you get here? - Just now. Just now. - Hey. - Hey, Michael. - Good to see you again, Aj. - Welcome. - Pleased to see you. Thank you. - Good trip down? - Yeah, it was great. Good, good. Good to see you. Have fun. Enjoy the partay. I am dead inside. What do you want, baby? We got some granola, got some cupcakes, chips, apples, pies You have a whole room of vending machines. I know. Isn't it something? I can't decide what I want.   Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Thank you. - And Merry Christmas. - Thank you. And Merry ChristMas. - Thank you so much. - Merry Christmas. - And Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas to you. - Merry Christmas. - Oh, thank you. For your feet. It's amazing. 'S so great. Thank you. - For me? - Yes. - Thank you very much. - Mm-hmm. I don't know if you guys have had a chance to use the new parking meters that accept credit cards, but Robert was instrumental in that legislation. Wow, that's awesome! A real David and Goliath story. I'm just so touched that she's so interested in my work. I am. The real problem is the teachers' union. - Zip it, Meredith. - No. You tell me why my kid is 17 and still can't read. Hey, who's in charge of making drinks around here? Is there a bartender? You are. You make your own drink. I'll make it. What are you drinking? An "f" train to Brooklyn. Extra bitters. I don't know how to make that. Okay, well, I'll just stick with my Mohito. And you know those annoying geese at the park? Well, he's helping eradicate them as well. I mean, I think they've really become a pest. - Annoying. - Yes. I don't think he's in the ceiling, babe. Well, uhI don't think any of us really know. All right. Is it Is it pebbles from the beach in Jamaica? Ooh, go easy with the shaking. Oh, my God. You like it? I love it. Yep, I do make great Christmas gifts. But I couldn't make that. All right, my turn. Oh, um, it's just I didn't I didn't have a lot of time, so that's just a place holder. Right. Of course. "The adventures of Jimmy Halpert." OhMyGod. This is awesome! That's my bike. That's my desk. And that is my daughter. I mean Better office policy up there. It's not as fun as Scranton. But it should be the same policy as us. Michael, wait. Oh, hey, hey, no, don't run. You're gonna slip. - That's good advice. - Yep. I read this story about a woman who slipped on some black ice, and she hit her head and went into a coma forever. And then every day, her husband went and visited her in the hospital until she died. That's a sad story. Yeah, well, at least he was married. Oh, okay, Michael, slow down. Everything's gonna be okay. No, it's not. It's not. Oh, man, I can tell you confidently that it is not gonna be okay. I shouldn't tell you this, but Aj won't commit to Holly. And she's gonna tell him that if he doesn't propose to her by the end of the year, it's over. Really? Really. And I don't know about you, but I don't know of a lot of happy marriages that start off with an ultimatumDo you? No. So just be patient. Yeah. I mean, I can wait till then. Come here. I don't want you to fall. I surrender. I do not accept your surrender. There's only one way that I would ever relent. Anything. You got it. You hit Pam in the face with a snowball while I watch. You're a psychopath. I'll take that as a no. I was in the mall, and I saw that, and I thought it had your name written all over it. Michael, this is the gift that corporate gave us that I picked out. You're re-gifting this to me. No, that's not No, I went to the mall and I picked that out especially for you. Oh, yeah? Well, show me the receipt. From the mall. That This is a fast food receipt from April. WellThat God, how many number nines did you order? Is everyone here kind of mean? Oh, I think everyone's on edge because of the strangler trial. - Oh. - Hey I'm so glad you came down. It's been so much harder than I expected. Hey, what happened to Woody? Oh, okay, get ready for this. You're not gonna believe it. I was making salad, and he fell right into the dressing. I mean, there was salad dressing all over him. - He smells awful. - It was blue cheese dressing. Great. - Hey, Mike. - Hey. We wanted to give you something. - Oh. - Merry Christmas. Thank you. A hostess apple pie! This is my favorite breakfast. How did you know that? Thank you very much. - What do you say? - You're welcome. Oh, you know, I seem to remember that Santa promised that he would listen to all the gifts you wanted for Christmas. Didn't he say that? I think I know where he is. - A trampoline - Mm-hmm. - Video games. - Video games. - A horse. - A horse. Are you sure you don't want a pony? - You want a real horse. - Mm-hmm. All right. You have to pick up after them. Hey, sorry. I'm ready. I don't want to go. Oh Come on, bear man. Come on. Have you ever seen 'em do that? I'm sorry. I had no idea. No, it's it's okay. - Okay. - Oh, my God. Oh, my God. No, no, no, no. - Okay, this is it. - What? - Go! Go! Go! - What? What is it? What? Oh, my God! Honey? Jim? Jim! In the end, the greatest snowball isn't a snowball at all. It's fear. Next stop, secretary **, we'll read the minutes for Sunday's meeting. Minutes from previous meeting, oh, knights of the night - No! Jim, hey. - Oh. This meeting is for knights of the night only. Knights of the night are volunteer crime patrollers. We're often compared to the guardian angels, but we could not be more different from them. Seriously, we are nothing like the guardian angels. I mean, broad strokes purposes, sure. Think guardian angels. One of our many recent good deeds. We set out to capture the Scranton strangler. Mission accomplished. Not by us. I'm actually just looking for my BlackBerry, so carry on. No, no, no, no, no. I see how this movie ends. You make fun of me, everyone laughs. Ha, ha, ha. Screw you. Dwight, don't be bothered by your friend's presence. What are you gonna do now? You gonna make fun of our leader's weird voice, huh? Dwight, don't be bothered vah, vee, vah, vah, vah. Over the line, Jim. I'm just looking for my phone, so pretend I'm not here. Fine. Minutes from previous meeting of knights of the night. It's our official name, Jim. Sounds good. Reflective strips were glued to patrol jackets. Knights went outside with flashlights to test them. Smart. And the rest was just boiler plate stuff that's go ahead and read it, some people weren't here. Okay. Knights stayed outside to play flashlight tag. Oh, come on. That sounds awesome. - It was pretty cool. - Was it? - It was fun. - It was it was pretty awesome. Hey, yeah. No, I got it. Just leaving now. January three, 2011. A day which will live infamously. Holly partridge flax, otherwise known as Holly, otherwise-otherwise known as a living, breathing angel, is engaged to another man. This is freaking me out. I Okay, let's just switch to the happy video, okay? No, no, no, no. Let's push through. We'll do this. Today will either be the best or the worst day of my life. Holly gave AJ an ultimatum. He either proposes by new years or they break up. Now if she's engaged, I'm gonna go crazy. And I'm gonna start attacking people. If she's not engaged, in all honesty, I may just burn this whole place to the ground out of happiness. Either way, I am going to need some talking down. And nobody talks me down like myself in a video talking me down. Michael, I know what you're thinking. Holly is engaged to somebody else and you want to kill yourself. That may seem like a good idea, but it's not. Snot. Sorry, it sounded like you said, "it's snot." I'm so sorry. Okay, so killing yourself I was just thinking about snot. Good morning. Hey, guys. Uh, fun thing. The index cards on your desk are resolution cards. You write your new year's resolution on them, I'll collect them, and then display the cards on This Resolution board. Wow, did your baby draw that? The glitter is blinding. - Oh, I think it's good. - It's gonna be fun. I recently met sue, the office administrator at vance refrigeration. She has this awesome wall full of fun initiatives and morale boosters and stuff. Sue just goes for it. She's awesome. I know sue, she's not that great. And you know her husband's in a wheel chair, right? - Okay, champagne. - Happy. - Sponge. - Sad. To soak up my tears. Gummi bears and gummi worms. Bears sad, worms happy. C'mon, man. UkulelesHappy? Sad. Something to break. Chocolates. For you, job well done. Thank you. And two bottles of scotch. Both sad. And did you get the tickets? I did, I did indeed. Two front row center to Paula Poundstone, live in Poughkeepsie. Holly's favorite. I hope she doesn't call us up onstage, that would suck. Hey, you think you could do my job better? I don't know. What's your name? Michael. I'm really excited for Michael either way. Because if Holly chooses to be with him, he will be so, so happy. And if not, he'll be avoiding the biggest mistake of his life. Oh. Hey, guys. I'd like to introduce you to a new little friend of mine. His name is new year's resolution board. Shaaaaa shut up. Hello. - Good morning. - Good morning. What happened? Is there a ring? So, high five me. We're back. To a happy aaaah. Look at those. Mittens. Those a present? Come on. They're warm. Those are so fuzzy and warm. Aah, let me feel those. Let me feel that. Put her there. Give me a good firm one. Ooh, that's a good, firm handshake. You're hired. Yes, well let's get right into the Anderson account, shall we? Oh, definitely. Yes, yes, right away. - Okay. - Yes, yes. Right away. Okay. Hey, hey, hey. Want me to crank the thermostat to 90? Smoke her out? She can't keep those mittens on forever. Yes no, what? Stop. Yes. Congrat - wow. - Ooh. Oh, my God. That's it, that's it. Oh, I get it. Everybody knows about the ultimatum. Yes, I told everyone. Ha, ha! Ha, ha! Hey, right back at you, bitch. Happy, happy, happy, happy! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay, calm down! Breathe. I'm trying. I said breathe. I'm trying. Wait a second. Are you listening to music? What? Shut that off. I'm not listening to the music. Fine, just go crazy for a little while. Ha ha, whoo! Looking good. You're looking good. Mmph, mmph! Oh, I gotcha, I gotcha! I'm pulling you back! - Michael dance-off! Oh, that's nice. That's nice. Go! Me, okay! Mm, mm, uh, oh yeah! Nice! We're gonna calm down later. I'm doing it. Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah! Right there, right there! Oh, yeah! Hey, Dwight. I'm collecting resolution cards. - Not doing that. - Why not? I've achieved plenty, and there's no better than the best. Drink less caffeine. That's a good one, Pam. Here's mine. Learn to cook for one. Yeah, I love cooking. But I always find myself throwing out half the food that I prepare. So I figured it's time to start preparing the right amount of food for the right number of people, which is one. Well, maybe you'll meet someone. No, some people just don't meet someone. I'm fine with it. Really. This is not a pity party. It's not a party at all. It's just sad. - Angela. - Yes. "Make time for romance." Who's the senator? My boyfriend. Oh. Oh, you mean the state senator. I'm sorry, I was confused 'cause you accidentally wrote "the senator." Wait, wait, wait. It's that easy? That's not a resolution. That's just something I wanna do. Okay, fine. I can do that. My resolution is Meet a loose woman. Oh, God. - That's a good one. - Yeah? You know what? That's my new one. I'm taking that one, too. Awesome. You know what you guys should do? Go to the book store at lunch. There's tons of cuties and it's easy to talk to them. "Hey, what book is that? "Cool, let's hang out tonight. Sex already? Whoa." - The book store? - It's that easy? I'll come with you, show you how it's done. - Okay. - I'll drive. My resolution is to read more. And if someone else is driving me to the book store, I can eat my pb&amp;j; in the car. Hello. Oh, somebody's got a new phone. - Yeah. - That is neat. I got it for Christmas. I'm so out of my league here. E.T. Phone Holly. Holly like phone? Holly misses old phone. Why? New phone is confusing. Gets bad reception. Oh, bummer. Bummer. Reese's pieces. Reese's pieces? Oh, God. Please stop. I still have my old phone. This thing, indestructible. Oh, I should get this. Hey. Oh, no. Don't go see that one. I want to see that together. Yeah, go see that action one. Okay. I love you, too. All right. Holly doesn't seem to be engaged, but she's talking to AJ like she is. I can't figure it out. Do you think she's already dating a different AJ? I don't think so. When you broke it off with Roy did you still tell him you loved him? - No. - But you did still love him. - I'm not gonna have - Do you love him now? No! Just talk to her. No, she'd just resent me. Or worse, she would think of me as her friend. Oh, hi friend. Yuck. I'll talk to her, Michael. You think she'd talk to you? Why wouldn't she? That's true, she's really nice. She'd talk to anybody. Why don't you bring Erin to balance you out. There's a plan. All right. We should divide up by section. I will take romance and travel. I'll take the entirety of the second floor. I got that cutie behind the counter. - Well, if you read a lot you should check out our e-readers. They're really neat. Oh, I work at a paper company. Those things terrify me. They could put us out of business, you know? Heard those machines are, like, ten bucks a month. Actually, it's $10,000. Holy. What? Let me see that. So light. Like a croissant. - Hi. - Hi. Welcome. Let us know if you need anything. - Thanks. - Mm-hmm. Why did we pretend like we work here? Is that what we were doing? I don't know, uh Hey, how'd you do? - Good. - Good, real good. - Yeah. - Yeah. I think we kinda nailed it. Yeah, pretty much. But, you know, this place is kinda tapped out, so let's roll. - Cool. - Okay. - What'd you get? - A book about oceans. Oh, really? What else? Let me see. That's, uh, porn. Pornography. Old lady. Nasty porn. Follow my lead. Hey, want some company? Want some company? Oh, sure. Have a seat. How were your breaks? Oh, really good. I went to Portugal. I went to Portugal. Oh, wow. You went together? - No. - No. So, I just gotta know. What's going on with you and AJ? Nothing really happened. I mean, I know I made a big deal about this whole new year's deadline, but, um, it came and went and we're still together. You didn't break up with AJ at all? I mean, not even for a week to make him buy you a present? It just wasn't fair of me to give him an ultimatum in the first place. The whole thing is totally my fault. But we're gonna be just fine. Just fine. - Whoa. - Hold on. I am not going back until I fulfill my resolution. - Oh, no, no, no. Uh-uh. Come on, why not? I've never been in one before. I'm tired of being Mr. perfect role model all the time. I'm telling you, don't do it. I got nothing against strip clubs, but I do have something against them at noon on a Monday. The day shift at a strip club? You can't unsee that. Well, we can't just go back. I mean, we came out to meet women. Hey, there's a roller rink across the street. There's always chicks at the rink. What kind of chicks are you gonna meet there? I don't know. Single moms at a skating party? Sweet 16, ten-year reunion parties. Chicks fall down, need help getting back up. Roller derby practice. Aah! Rrrawr! We're going skating. The goal of this meeting is to get everybody excited about their resolutions. Who's been good about their resolution so far? - Me. - Mm. Erin, tell us about it. Well, my goal was to learn a new word every single day. And I must say that it is going immensely. Cool. Here's a little "way to go" gift from sabre. - Intercepted. - Hey. Huh? Whoops. Creed, I notice you don't have a resolution on the board. What's yours? I want to do a cart wheel. They're real casual, I think. Not enough to make a big deal out of it. But I know everybody saw it, just one stunning, gorgeous cartwheel. How's it going? I'm having a little trouble motivating. One of the hardest parts about making resolutions is keeping them. In fact, most resolutions are abandoned by February. - Or sooner. - Yeah. - It's not a joke. - But that's okay. Because it's not about being perfect, it's about trying. In fact, why don't we go around and confess some of the ways that we've already fudged on our resolutions? Well, I said that I would eat more vegetables, and I haven't yet. But it's okay. I still have time. Since last year I ate none. Okay, well, my confession is that today I had a sip of coffee. But that's fine. Is it? Yes, because with all of your support, by this time next year maybe I'll be down to one glass of iced tea a week. Next year? Come on. I mean, what is the point? What is the point of that? I made a resolution to floss. And I did it. Bam! Blood everywhere. Not all of us are Michael freakin' Scott. What is wrong with you people? Can't you stick to anything? Erin, I want you to go to the kitchen and get me some vegetables. Creed, you say you want to do a cartwheel? Nothing's stopping you. Come on, old man. Do a cartwheel! Well, I can't. I don't know how. You're just going to somersault around for the rest of your life. And you know what's gonna be on your tombstone? Loser. My tombstone's already made, thank you. Just do a cartwheel! This is all I could find. Eat it. You don't have to do that, Kevin. Oh, no. I'm glad this is happening. Thank you, Michael. Why are you eating stem first? This is a new food for me. How else should I eat it? Can I get some cheez whiz? Or hollandaise? No, no. No cheez whiz, no hollandaise, no chocolate sauce, just eat it. Come on, here comes the airplane. There you goOpen, open, into the hanger, there you go. - Oh, no. - Michael. Yeah, eat it. Put it in your mouth, and just eat it. God, I hate it. I don't care whether you hate it, you said you'd do it! - Michael, Michael. - All right. - Eat it, eat it! - Oh, my God. You're killing him, Michael. All right, all right, all right! - Michael! - Shh! Okay, I ate the Fluffy part. Can I be done? Let me see if you swallowed it. Open your mouth. Under your tongue. Oh, God! You guys are pathetic. Can I get some candy or something? - No, you can't have any candy! - I'll get him water. Okay, Michael. Just settle down. God! Yes, Michael? Not Michael, e.T. What's up? Well, I just want to talk about what happened in there. Oh. No, Michael. I don't want to talk about it with you. And I'm fine, I just I don't want to talk about it. Okay. Holly, come on in. Thanks for coming. I thought there should be an hr rep here for this. So Kevin and creed, things got a little bit intense in the conference room. - You think? - And I wanted to apologize. These resolutions should be about you, and I made it about me. And it was none of my beeswax. You were super mean. It was insensitive and I am sorry. It was traumatizing, Michael. I wouldn't be surprised if I never ate a vegetable again. I really wanted you to follow through on your resolutions. The cartwheel, the veggies. I I care about you. Very much. And you loom so large in my heart that I crossed the line. Okay, Michael, no offense. But you need to get your own life. You're right. And I hope that we can still be friends. I don't think I'm there yet, boss. - Well, I am. - Okay. All right. - I'm gonna help you. - Okay, okay. Hey, uh, it's just you. Anything you want to hear? Um, Dave Matthews Band. No hits, deep tracks only. Okay. I said, no hits. - Hey, Ryan. - Yeah. How's your fart project coming? That's real, real classy, Kevin. Hey, was it me or you that just shoved the butt end of a pound of broccoli into my mouth because Michael told me to. - Me. - Mm-hmm. - Kevin, don't. - Mm. Come on. Oh, Pam? SodaCaffeine. Yeah, just a little. I have a lot to deal with today. Well, if you don't have to do 'em Meredith, what are you doing? I could be pregnant. Okay, no. Oh, my resolution was to get more attention. Nope, she's lying. Hey, Ryan. One, two, three. I did it. I did a cartwheel. You, [Bleep] You! God! - Okay, that's it. - God! Lesson learned. - What's up? - Hey, where'd you go? - To the arcade. - Oh, cool. Why, did you meet someone? Yeah. I did, actually. - Oh? - His name is Andy. And he roller skates like a Greek God. And you know what? I kinda like hanging out with him. Right on, son. Gentlemen. And where did you go? Strip club. I was looking at the strippers at the strip club. - Right. - So that's it, guys? If you want I can put on the strobe. Yeah! Do you want to keep this? Do you want to keep this? Yeah. - Do you wanna keep this? - No, you can toss them. My resolution? I never want to make Holly cry again. Unless it's from laughing too hard. Or making love too beautifully. We're gonna be just fine. You know how you say something over and over and the words start to sound weird? Going to be just fine. Just fine, just fine, just fine. I just think we need to cool things down for a while. Yeah, a break. At least until I get back to nashua. Yeah, I'm sure. Look at where you're going to be doing the cartwheel. So look where you're going to be placing your hand. So pick a spot. - Mm-hmm. - You ready to do this? - Yes, sir. You know what? I'm gonna stay here as long as it takes. I really appreciate it. Go. I did it! You did? A perfect cartwheel. Okay, good!  congratulations. Well, alright, see you tomorrow. I'm not picking on you at all. You're English, correct? Yeah, big time, yeah. I'm working on an English character. Would you mind gi it's called Reginald Pooftah. Ooh! David Brent, my liege. How are you? - Michael Scott. - Oh, there you go. I do characters as well. I got a Chinese fella. He's called ho me [Bleep]. That's what it sounds like. [Laughing] - Herrow! Herrow! - I do ping. Herrow. I ping. You can't do that these days. You can't. No, no, no. And people don't understand that it has nothing to do with making fun of a different nationality. No, no, no. No, comedy is a place where the mind goes to tickle itself. That's what she said. [Laughing] Ohh! That's good. Pleasure to meet you. - Where are you working? - Dunder Mifflin. - Any jobs now? - No, not right now. - Just let me know. - All right. All right. See ya around. - Bye-bye. What a nice guy. [Elevator bell dings] [Cheerful music] [Door opens] Your first student is here, mister Bernard. That's actually "master of ceremonies" Bernard. Last year, I went to a seminar called "the ten secrets of real estate." Turns out it was just a ploy to sell me time-shares in Idaho. Cut to, you know, I'm spending a weekend in Boise, terrible time, super lonely. But I get to thinking maybe I should put on my own seminar to lure clients. Oh, it's [door closes] [Gruff, accented voice] Hello, I am here for the small business seminar. Michael? Neii'm Greek! My name is Mikanos. Ooh. Ohh. [Snickers] Wait, Michael? Michael? Okay. I am the plant. Every great seminar has one. My job is to make the speaker look good, and I do this through the techniques of leading questions and laughing at all jokes. And the character, Mikanos, is just a little added Flava. Mikanos is loosely based on another character I do, Spiros, who is more about the ladies. Thank you so much, tuna Turner. You are simply the best. Listen, this isn't a favor, all right? This is a good idea. We all win. Go higher. I get super flexible when I'm nervous. Wow. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Hey, Andy, I'm really, really sorry to do this to you, but I have a meeting today that I totally forgot, so I can't be a part of this seminar. No. What? You can't do that. You are a critical part of this seminar. You're the charming warm-up guy. - I know. - If the seminar was a meal, you'd be the amuse-bouche. You, like, signal the flavors of the whole night. I'm really sorry. I can't do it you can't. You can't. I can't have this go badly. I'm a terrible salesman, and I haven't been making very many sales lately, or ever. This is my only idea on how to turn things around. If it goes badly, I might lose my job, which would suck, because this is the only job I've ever been good at. [Slaps desk] Will you let me know when this whole seminar thing's over? What's going on? Do you know that guy? I just have a meeting, uh, outside the office. Hey. How are the marks? What are some of your small business ideas? I was thinking we could buy up a bunch of abandoned mineshafts. All: Oh. That's great. There's a big, big future in that. A lot of mines in Scranton. Um, what about you? - Uh, credit cards. - Uh-huh. My company will act as an intermedium for, like, 0.2 cents off every transaction. Wow! Or something with cell phones, like, every time you make a phone call, I'd make 0.2 cents. Or anything like, any online shopping, I get .2 cents basically. Right. Okay? Okay. Great. You promised us whales. These are worms. They're not worms, Dwight, okay? They're just people with tiny businesses. They're baby whales, which is even cuter. I'm out. Stanley, you're supposed to close. I'm out, too. What? I already lost Jim. Salesmen are supposed to help each other out. We're supposed to be a team. We're no more a team than the people staying in the same hotel are a team. You know what might be kind of fun? I was thinking, you know Andy's having a seminar today? What if we went in as a Greek couple? Mikanos and Oh, I don't know, Michael. I'm not feeling up to that. Okay. Holly broke up with a.J. Last week, which is the greatest thing that has ever happened To me. To Holly, it's been the worst week of her life, and I know for a fact that there was a week for her in High School when she got mono and her first period ever. Too much information? That's what I thought. But you know what? Here I am using it. [As mikanos] If-a you change-a you mind, why don't you talk to mikanos? Is mikanos Greek? He sounds Italian. Ugh. You're the fifth person to tell me that today. Maybe mikanos ran away to join the Italian circus. Okay, yeah, like a character history. Good. Tom Hanks does that. [Muttering] DownThere. Is "JLP" a word? - "Jelp"? J-e-l-p? - No, j-l-p. Like, "I JLP I JLP you!" I don't think that's a word. I'm playing scrabble with Gabe, and I've never won a game. The winner gets to pick the movie we watch. I have won no games. So far I've seen the shining, Rosemary's baby, the ring. Not really my thing. Although, I I do like the early parts of the movies where they have a perfect family and everything. You want some help? Really? - Mm-hmm. Yes. - K-a. "Ka"? What does "ka" mean? It means you're playing someone who's going to destroy you. Why did you play "moo"? Because I'm playing to win. I'm playing "moo," I'm playing "milk, whatever it takes. Okay, but look, you could have hit "mood." Would have played a Uh! A triple word. Like the cow mood yesterday. God. Or moon. The cow jumped over the moon. No, it doesn't have to just be cow stuff, right? Kevin, Jim dropped out of my seminar, and I'm just I was wondering if you could replace him as my charming warm-up guy. Andy, I'm no Jim. The only way that I'm Jim is in the movie version when Jim sees what his future would be like if he never met Pam. Hey, that's crazy talk. I think you're great. Then I won't let you down. - Cake. - In you go. Hi, Ryan, you went to business school, right? - Yeah. - I need someone to talk to this seminar about business. - And? - Can you do it? Okay. I don't I don't like committing to things just like that. So no? No, I don't like committing to not doing things, either. That's just as big a commitment. Oh, baby. What do I put you down for, bro hombre? Yes. - All right! - Yes, I'll do it. Okay, thank you so much. It's gonna be awesome. - And if I flake, I flake. - What? Kevin, you open it up. Yep. Ryan, you come in with your small biz expertise, right? And then creed, guest speaker extraordinaire. And then I come in and just close all the sales and stuff. Um, okay, here we go. One, two, three! - Go. - Creed! Ha! Welcome everybody. Awesome to see you guys. My name's Andy Bernard, but you can call me the nard dog. Hi, nard dog. I'm Lu Peachem. Let's get things started, shall we? You guys ready to hear from the dunder Mifflin business experts? [Clapping] Good. Well, as you can see on your program, first up is a speech called, "don't just dream it, do it." Yes! Please give a big hand to Mr. Kevin Malone. [On cd player] All aboard! Ha ha ha ha ha! [Ozzy Osbourne's crazy train]  Ay  [Echoing]   Three, four, five. [Electric guitar intro]   [Slaps blinds] Yes! There are some people who have charm and some people who don't. Guess which type I am. Charm type. [Out of breath] DreamBig. Right? So what I want you to do is dream the biggest that you cAn. [Coughing] And then double it! [Coughing] Are you okay? No. Yes! - Here. - N I'm fine. Okay, from here now. The first lesson that I'm gonna teach you, right, is about finding success. And the key to finding success is to picture a winner. [Coughing] [Vomiting] Okay, so then, what are you picturing right now, right this second? 'Cause the universe is yours, people. Get out of the way. [Vomiting] I'm really excited to introduce you guys to Ryan Howard. He has achieved a great deal in the last but perhaps no achievement is greater than his on-again, off-again girlfriend. What are you who am I? I'm Kelly Kapoor, the business bitch. It is important to brand yourself, so I have a couple of things in the works. The business bitch, the diet bitch, the shopping bitch, the etiquette bitch. I could sit here, and I could tell you the ten secrets of business, and you would have a great time, and you would learn a lot. But who better to tell you than the Yale university adjunct Professor in management, Professor Scott Powell, who I have on my BlackBerry. [Phone line rings] It's ringing. Hey, Kelly Kapoor. What a delicious surprise. Professor Powell, you are on speakerphone. Uh, why? Do you think you could tell us the ten secrets of business? Um, there aren't really ten secrets. Come on, Scott, please. It's me. Um, all right. Well, um, I guess know your market would be key. Practice fiscal discipline. - Mm-hmm. That brilliant little bitch. A little treat for our old friend, Gabe. Put that "q" right there. Wait. Why? Put the "q" there, sweetie. - I think there's better - Put the "q" there! [Phone chimes] Sorry I yelled. You could have just told us what you were thinking. There's no theater in that. There's no yelling in that, either. Well What do you do in your free time? [As mikanos] Practice Olympics. Mmm. Do you like movies? I like the musical grease, or as we call it "home." We have to try this out on somebody. [Both laughing] Hello. Look, you want to order something? She will have a greekaccino. I don't know what that is. It [with accent] It's a very strong coffee with milk from a goat. - [Laughs] I can't believe-ee. It's a miracle. She can talk! No more brain damage. No more brain damage! Ahh! I don't know. Ladies and gentlemen, our special guest speaker will provoke you. He will inspire you. He is Creed Bratton. [Applause] Two eyes, two ears, a chin, a mouth, ten fingers, two nipples. A butt, two kneecaps, a penis. I have just described to you the loch ness monster. And the reward for its capture? All the riches in Scotland. So I have one question: Why are you here? [Clapping] Okay! All right, ladies and gentlemen, it is now time for the rarest of things, an actual free lunch. There's sandwiches in the back. Certainly help yourselves. We'll meet back up in an hour. I picked out our movie. It's called suspiria. It pushes all the boundaries. All your preconceived notions about what horror can be come crashing down. - When I win - Ooh. - We're gonna watch wall-e, where all the boundaries of color are pushed. It is hard to explain why Erin is doing so well today. The only thing I can think is Erin is living out some slumdog millionaire scenario, where every word she's playing has a connection to her orphan past. It's possible. So what's your crazy business pipe dream? Well, I started my own golf supply company. Really? It's taken off faster than I expected, so I came here to learn about creating manageable growth. - [Quietly] Phyllis? - Hmm? Some of these people are for real. Hey, friend. How's it going? Oh, you know what? Let me steep that for you. Thank you. Hey, you know what? Good news. We're back in. Let's go sell some paper, buddy. Huh? Really? Ahem! - Excuse me. - I got it. I got it. Hey, do you need a lozenge? [Whispering] They're a bunch a jackals. What? They left you in the lurch, and if they want to jump in, it means you're almost there. You did this. Bring it home. Let me tell you what you can do with your offer to help. You can table it and offer it up another time. Just know that I really appreciate the gesture. Hi. Hope you enjoyed your lunch. Welcome back. Ooh. Well, hello. Welcome to the seminar. Hey, man. What's goin' on? [Whispering] You're gonna blow it. Maybe. Only maybe. I got it. [All laughing] Oscar, wait. I think the victory would be more meaningful if Erin puts the last word in herself. Yes, Pam. Yes, most definitely. Yes. Yes. Ah! No [laughing] Although I must say, I will have apoplexy if you lose. Do you understand? Apoplexy is what I will have. Apoplexy. - Yes. - Got it. [Phone plays losing sound effects] Oh, Oscar. Oscar? I played "ape." I just want to make a point to that last caller. I disagree. I don't think it is the running game at all. I think we do have to make a few moves in this off-season. Wow! What a day, right? Guess you guys are probably ready to go. And you got my business card, so [As mikanos] Dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah. You know, I like you. I'm going to give you my secret gyro recipe. Come out here since it's a secret, and I'll tell you. [Normal voice] All right, you have to close right now. Yeah, I mean, I'm getting to it. No, you're not. You're getting past it. You have to close. You can do it. Yeah, yeah. Andy, what's the problem? This is hard for me. I'm a nice guy. You know, Kelly and creed, Kevin, they believe in you. Don't let them down. Don't let yourself down, Andy. I'm gonna go back in. I'm going to stall them for a little bit. I want you to get your head together, and then come back in. I want you to close. [As mikanos] What is taking that guy so long? Psst. [Taps on door] You think this thing's gonna go much longer? I don't know. They're still in there. - Ohh! Good-bye. Stop. Out with it. Here's the story. That guy in there is Jim's childhood friend, tom. Tom Witochkin. One of my best buddies, actually. And when they were both in the third grade, Jim was placed in the top reading group. I was blue group, so it was second from the top. - And tom - Was in green group. And Jim's mom suggested that Jim spend time hanging with the kids in his reading group, because she thought that they would be a good influence. And that's what I told him. Right. But how'd you say it? "My mom thinks you're too dumb to hang out with." Okay, who would like to purchase this small business package from me right now? Yes, we got one. Okay, the snowball is rolling. Who else? You can put it off for a couple of days, but I guarantee you, eventually you're gonna realize you need this. So the only thing that's gonna be different is you'll be a couple of days behind where you would be if you bought this from me right now. So who's gonna buy one right now? I'll take one. Yes! Awesome! All right, anyone else? Sold! Anybody else? Yes! All right! - Yeah, bitch. - Good choice. The rest of you are dead to me. You made the stupidest decisions of your life. [Quietly] No, no, no. But it was a pleasure meeting you, and you've got my information, so feel free to call anytime. Whoo! Hey, you think it's cool if I grab a soda? Yeah. Whoa. [Deeper voice] Yep, absolutely, go ahead. Hey. Hey. How's it goin'? - Pretty good. - It's been a while. It has been, yeah. So you work here, huh? Sales. Must be a front for some kind of famous laboratory. [Laughs] 'Cause you're so smart. Oh, man. You remember that, huh? Oh, barely. I'm so dumb, you know, stuff goes in, stuff goes out. Not like you probably remember every paper sale you ever made. Paper salesman genius. - All right, good catch-up. - Yeah. - See ya. Where's your jetpack, Zuckerberg? Andy. I didn't think you had it in ya. Well, I guess when you looked in me, you forgot about my balls. They're on the outside. Don't know how you missed 'em. [With accent] Wonderful seminar! [As mikanos] Almost as good as the day when we first met. You are the love of my life. Come to me, necropolis. Put your lips on my lips. Come on. Michael, I should get back to work. What? Come on. It's time for grapes. Real fun day. - So, I won. - I know. You get to pick. Well, that's actually what I came to talk to you about. I know how much you want to watch wall-e. Yes? So I got us a compromise. This movie is called hardware, it tells the story of a killer combat robot, just like wall-e that the government invented to destroy humans. It's some of what you like and some of what I like. I heard you talked about movies before **** there's a Shrek 2? Oh, yeah. Nice guy. Everybody, can I please have your attention?  Ryan and I have a huge announcement.  Oh my gosh. Wow.  Over the weekend, Ryan Bailey Howard and I got divorced.  - Sweet. - Free ring.  Divorced?  Just so you know, it's totally amicable. We're fine.  We don't need people here to take sides.  The last thing that we want is any kind of drama.  Wait, I Can you back up?  What's the story?  We were having a beautiful weekend in the Poconos.  We were making love constantly.  We saw the sun rise, and Ryan was crying a lot.  - That's not a relevant detail. - And in the morning,  we walked by a chapel and we stopped suddenly,  and Ryan said  "I don't think I should be married to you anymore."  Wait, wha  Sorry, when did you get married?  Um, like a week ago.  We got really wasted, and it just felt right.  And you didn't invite any of us?  We are getting divorced, Andy!  This is such a raw time.  God, baby, you know, with people's reactions to this,  I wonder if we made a mistake.  No, with the messed-up laws in this country,  I don't want to be married until everyone can be married.  You know what, Ryan?  I talked to the other gay guys,  and we're okay with it.  We all agreed it's fine for you to get married.  No. No, Oscar.  Not not until everyone can.  Ryan, I changed my mind.  Okay, fine. You know what?  This actually isn't amicable at all,  and we actually do need people to take sides.  Who's on my side?  And who is on my side?   All right, bye.  - Bye. - Let's go.  Just a minute!  - How long do we have to wait? - For what?  You broke up with A.J. weeks ago.  Don't you have a sales call to go on?  I don't understand. I really don't, I mean  We know we're gonna start dating Why not now?  - We don't know that. - Sure we do.  Why is it such a certainty  that we're supposed to be together?  Why does the sun rise in the morning?  Why do magnets stick together?  Because everybody says so. Everybody.  Michael, I can't keep getting into a situation  where I date whoever I'm working with.  Well you can understand that.  Yeah, I understand.  I just don't agree.  Well, you don't have to agree.  Yes, I do.  No, you don't.  Yes, I do.  No, you can have your own opinion  I have my own opinion, and my opinion  is to disagree with you.  He's gonna be a lot of fun  to drive around in a car with.  Ah, you'll get through it, hon.  Just make a game out of it.  A funny Jim game.  That's it? That's all I get?  Even after all the hard work I put into  celebrating your talent today.  All right, what'd you do?  Well, those things that you consider doodles  I consider art.  Where'd you put it?  - Where'd I put what? - Let's go.  Oh, sorry. I gotta go.  - Say it. Where? - Okay, fine.  Three hints: One, when you're getting colder,  you're really getting warmer.  - The fridge. - Two!  You have a better chance if you think Bob Vance.  The fridge, got it.  - And the final clue - Let's go!  You know what? Just think about it.  - You'll be fine. - Bye.  Holly is ruining Michael's life.  He thinks she's so special.  And she's so not.  Her personality is like a three,  her sense of humor is a two,  her ears are like a seven and a four.  Add it all up, and what do you get?   And he treats her like she's a perfect 40.  It's nuts.  Cheer up. We made a sale.  Just drive faster. I wanna get back.  Well, I'm going the speed limit.  Okay, fine.  My feelings don't matter to you.  What matters to you is your precious speed limit.  Someone's in a bad mood.  No, I'm not.  I'm not in a bad mood.  I'm not, Jim. Hello?  Okay, fine, ignore me.  Have it your way.  Let's just talk about you.  As always.  Sex different after the baby, Jim?  All right, let me turn on some music.  - I need to pee! - No, you don't.  Yeah, I do. My word against yours.  All right, well, we'll be there in ten minutes.  What part of "I need to pee" do you not understand?  I'm upset, my bladder is full,  there is no telling what I might do, right now,  all over the inside of your precious little car.  All right, well, if I see a gas station,  - I'll pull over. - Well, I hope I make it.  Hello?  Hi, Jim, it's Helene.  Hey, Helene. Is everything okay?  Everything's fine. Baby's fine.  She has a tiny fever. I'm taking her for a checkup.  Nothing to worry about, uh  Okay.  A tiny thing. I locked her in the car.  - What? - She's smiling. She's happy.  - Oh, my God. - Jim, I Jim  - Oh, my God. - I don't have a spare key.  Just just stay there.  I'll be there in one second.  Michael!  Michael!  Excuse me, sir, there's a  There's a guy in the bathroom.  He's coming out, but I have to go,  'cause it's an emergency.  Will you just tell him to call the office?  Just call Call the office.  Thank you! Please?  Hello?  - This is Pam. - Hey, it's me.  So, uh, don't worry. Everything's okay.  - What's wrong? - Nothing, absolutely nothing.  But you're not holding a cup of coffee or anything, are you?  - Jim, what? - UhOkay.  So Cece had a little bit of a fever.  And your mom also locked her in the car.  - Oh, God. What? - No, no, no, it's okay.  So Cece's with daddy now,  and she is laughing and she's happy,  and we're on our way to see Dr. Barbara.  Okay, so she's okay?  Yes, and your mom got a very well-deserved day off.  So here's the thing, though.  I left Michael at the gas station  on Bennett.  Understood.  And his wallet and phone are on the seat next to him.  Got it.  I will put out an A.P.B.  otherwise known as an "Ask Pam Beasley."  Did the phone cut out?  Nope.  All right, just call me after the doctor.  - Okay. - All right, bye.  Bye.  I know, I know.  You have a phone policy. I understand.  But this is an emergency,  because my friend isn't here,  and I'm worried that he has been abducted.  - No. - And and  No, he ditched you, man. I saw him drive away.  There's no way he ditched me.  There's no way that happened.  He's my Okay.  May I please just use your phone? Please.  Just make it quick.  Thank you. Okay.  I will make it quick. I will make it very quick.  And you don't have my numbers on speed dial.  Aah, okay, what is it?  You don't know.  - Oh, co come - You don't.  You know what?  I could dial 411, get Jim's number  He left you here on purpose, all right?  I saw it.  He just drove away.  Actually, this is good.  I am going to take this opportunity  to go walkabout.  Good, good.  No, get away.  No. That's enough.  Okay.  Okay.  It's the gas station on Bennett Street?  Yeah.  You know what?  Why don't you stay and I'll go?  Oh, no, no, no, I'll be fine.  It's kind of a sketchy neighborhood, though.  I better come along.  Problem solved, everyone.  Space Orphan and Princess Nincompoop  are off to rescue Michael.  Unbelievable. I'm going.  You drive. I got a car full of fox meat.  Cute.  Very funny, everyone.  Who wrote captions under my doodle?  I'm not even kidding. They're pretty good.  - Which one in particular? - Yeah, which one?  Well, the first one has a surprise factor.  "I'm a suck-suck-suckety Sabre."  Boo-yah!  No. No, no.  No, no, no.  But, uh, I suppose the second one  is the better written line.  - You suppose? - What's it say?  "I'm supposed to be wearing red gloves,  but my color cartridge portal got jammed again."  Okay, no, no, no, no, no.  Gloves.  Keep it real.  You guys, if I knew you wanted to do a caption contest,  I would have drawn something more challenging.  - And I will take you all down. - You?  I been reading the comics to my daughter  since she was three years old.  Not once have I used the real captions to Family Circus.  That crazy family is hilarious to her for one reason  Me.  Oh, it is on  like Genghis Khan wearing Sean John in Bhutan.  Yes. You guys, I have the perfect idea.  Okay, it'll just take me ten minutes.  - Whoo-hoo! - All right.  I want to do it.  Male, Caucasian, 40s, black hair,  facial type marsupial.  He answers to Michael, Michael G. Scott,  Michael J. Fox, Mr. Fox, the Incredible Mr. Fox.  - Yeah, he just left. - Which way did he go?  Hey, hey, hey, hey, let me answer this.  Stupid question. He went back to the office,  obviously, which is that way.  Oh, really?  You don't think he walked by that bakery  just for the smell of it?  She's right. He went that way.  All right.  Don't get a swelled head. You're no tracker.  Let's ride.  Hey, you guys. Listen to me.  Don't get hung up on just one girl,  because there are a lot of other girls over there.  Look over there. See?  They look cute.  Hello.  You guys are so beautiful.  You're so colorful.  I wish I could understand you.  That's a metaphor, I guess.  You are disgusting.  You'll never find love.  Lecch.  Do you think she needs more time,  or it's just never gonna happen?  I'm being serious. Seriously.  Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam.  Has Michael checked in?  - Oh, hey, Dwight. - I asked you a question.  - No, he hasn't. - Okay, bye.  No, wait, um, hey, while you're out,  could you pick up some paper towels and chocolate syrup?  We have ice cream, so I thought we could  Pam, this isn't a shopping trip.  This is a manhunt-slash-rescue mission.  Okay, I just  When you're done, or any time it's convenient,  I just thought since you're out  Pam, I'm obviously gonna get that stuff for you,  so just shut up. God.  Okay, well, it wasn't ob  No word from Michael.  Tada.  Okay, it's two giant dogs with two giant palm trees  on a regular-sized island.  - Oh, I got one. - Yeah?  - Yes. - Okay, I'm sorry,  but I'm gonna have to shut this down.  - Boo. - Why?  Unless we can all agree to some ground rules.  It's either that or I can fax this to Jo  and let her decide how to proceed.  Gabe, tell us your stupid rules  so we can start the game.  Number one, and this should be obvious,  no captions that insult the company we work for.  Irony is such a critical  Number two, no pop culture references.  - Seriously? - Wow.  I think we can all agree  they tend to alienate those who don't get the reference,  making them feel like the other.  Wrap it up, Gabe.  Okay, final thing, and this is a fun one,  instead of writing the caption directly under the picture,  let's all try using sticky quips.  All right? New from Dunder Mifflin-Sabre.  Sticky quips are fun, they're safe, they're handy.  I like to use sticky quips as regular post-it notes  when I'm in a fun mood.  Not every day.  Go get 'em. Start quipping.  Pam, I think I'm gonna send you an I.M.  Oh, okay.  Send me one too.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, put me on that.  - C.C. - Ditto.  Hello.  I would like a hot dog, please.  Now, I don't have any money,  so here is what I would like to do.  I leave you here with my watch,  and I come back later and I pay for the hotdog.  I'm not a pawn shop.  Well, I understand that, but this is a $45 watch.  Wow.  With that, I could buy  Half the menu.  I can't just go giving away hotdogs.  All right.  What do you do with the hotdogs that you don't sell?  Throw 'em away.  Well, okay, instead of throwing them all away later,  why don't you just throw one away now into my mouth.  No.  Okay. You've just lost my business.  Hey.  Hey, you were in there forever.  There's too many brands. Where's Holly?  She wandered off like an idiot.  - Hey. - Hey.  What are you doing?  Oh, just changing my cell phone plan.  Okay. Okay. Here you go.  I'll take my free stress ball too now.  Sure thing. Here you go, miss  Okay, Fanny Smellmore.  - Real original. - What?  You know what? Say hi to Orville Tootenbacher for me.  Tootenbacher.  Orville Tootenbacher,  that's Michael's millionaire character that  Farts popcorn.  Of course. He was here.  She's the key. Amazing.  Holly.  Hey, where would you like to go next?  Holly?  Are their egg rolls really that big?  Oh, boy. That was yummy.  Thank you so much.  You know what? I think I left my wallet in my car.  Do you mind if I run out and get it?  - No problem. - Okay.  I'll be right back.  Okay, you know what?  I'm sorry. I'm sorry.  I don't have my wallet. And I was  I was gonna try to dine and dash,  and that was stupid,  and I realize I can't do that to you fine people.  So you can't pay for your food?  Well, I can, but I will have to come back later tonight  and pay you.  But the point is I did the right thing.  You did not.  You have no money,  but you dined, and you dined so much.  Well, the number three is not such a giant feast.  Mr. Chu!  Okay, all right. You know what?  You're trying to steal food from us?  I am not.  I just have had a bad day,  and I Okay.  I'll be back later with the money.  I'm just gonna leave right now.  You can't. We'll stop you.  Well, I think I can get through the door.  Excuse me. Do you speak English?  We are looking for a man,  Michael, this tall, black hair, Caucasian.  It's Michael!  He just left.  - You knew! - What?  No. Dwight asked if I wanted an egg roll.  What What are you implying?  Uncanny. Put a pin in that.  Which way did he go?  That guy! When he leave here,  which way did he go? We looking for him.  This way, this way, this way? I don't know.  Do you know?  I think he was heading downtown.  He's heading downtown.  So what, no one's even gonna try?  - Guess not. - Oh, come on.  My rules could not possibly have been that oppressive.  You crushed our spirits, Gabe.  Congrats. You're a big man, huh?  Takes a lot to destroy the creativity  of a whole group of people.  Hey  Click the "x".  - I'm clicking! - In the box.  I am clicking.  Woman, you've had a computer for years!  - Phyllis! - Too late!  Oh. Ha. An I.M. chat.  Very clever.  I'll just print that out.  Come on, guys. Grow up.  I don't want to be your babysitter.  Ooh.  "Darn it, Bob, I told you not to buy  a Sabre brand lifeboat."  - Nice! - No, not nice.  Terrible.  Doesn't even include the fact that they're dogs.  - Do the next one. - "Wake up, Fred.  "The power cord on your Sabre printer  "shocked you into a coma,  and you're dreaming you're a dog on a desert island."  Dreaming he's a dog on an island.  Uh, excuse me, excuse me.  How does the speaker know what the guy in the coma is dreaming?  Well, if you think it's so easy, Gabe,  - why don't you try it? - Um  You don't have to sniff my rear end anymore, Bob.  I'm the only one here. Ha.  That's tasteless, Gabe.  - Tasteless? - Tasteless.  More tasteless than this?  "Is that a palm tree,  "or did Gabe get skinner?  Either way, let's pee on it.  Ladies and gentlemen, I think we have a winner.  - Yes. - Yes. Well done!  Whose is it? Who wrote that?  Yeah. Who wrote it?  Please. It was easy once I decided  I wanted the dog to piss on Gabe.  Where did he go, Holly?  I have no idea.  Do you see a little clown that you wanna follow, huh?  Is there a little bird that's chirping to you,  "this way, this way."  I don't know.  Okay. Close your eyes.  We need you to think.  What is Michael seeing right now?  Can you tell him that we miss him?  Michael, we're coming for you!  Will you stop?  There have been a few coincidences  That's all!  All right, then.  - Someone propose a plan. - Okay.  - We fan out - Not you, Erin.  Stop looking at me like that.  Okay, look, let's just go up somewhere high  and see if we could spot him on the street below.  That is the stupidest idea I've ever heard. No.  Tap into your common mind and tell us what he would do next.  Look, I'm not playing. I'm gonna go look for him.  - Good. We don't need her. - Right.  I can do this on my own. I can think like Michael.  All right  I'm deep below the ocean's surface in a submarine.  A torpedo's coming right at me.  No. Damn it, that's just my own imagination.  Maybe he's bowling.  Michael?  Hi.  How did you know I was up here?  What are you doing up here?  I got turned around.  I thought I could see Dunder Mifflin.  Dunder Mifflin?  Yeah.  Wow!  I just miss you so much.  I missed you too.  Really?  Yeah.  Can I kiss you?  - Yeah. - Okay.   Maybe that's not the best one. Keep reading.  - Yeah, it was. - Maybe it wasn't.  Oh, thank God, I had a horrible nightmare that I was stuck in America with Gabe.  No, that's not the one I was thinking of. Keep going.  I know what it smells like  but I didn't roll in anything,  It's from listening to all of Gabe's bullshit.  Isn't this the perfect romantic getaway, Erin?  Sitting on a desert island in dog costumes?  I'm Gabe and I'm a weirdo.  Gabe's mom  Mm, Gabe's mom?  Wait, tall woman? Looks like Gabe?  Yeah, I banged her.  Yeah, there you go. Hey. How are you doing? Been thinking about my grandmother a lot. Yeah. She was about to turn 97. At least she lived a very long and I'm sure very happy life. Got you this card. When you're ready, we all signed it. We just wanted you to know we're thinking about you. Thank you. "Congratulations, Darryl. Let's get wasted. "Have fun today, big guy. "Aww, yeah. Party time." It's possible that some people thought it was your birthday. "Hooray. Live it up, big d. "Days like this don't come often enough. "Time to celebrate. You deserve this"? Birthday punches! I'm so sorry. So I got an early res at blue wasabi and I'm taking Rachel. She's picking me up after work. Rachel from the party? Oh, yeah. Nice. Do the damn thing. Pow! Blue wasabi is so good, but get the cheeseburger. They say they won't do it, but they will if you make a scene. - Okay, bye. - Okay, bye. - I'll miss you. - Miss you. - Mwah. - Okay. I'll be in my office if you need me. Mwah. Bye. - Okay, bye. - Bye. - All right, bye. Bye. - Bye. Okay, one more quick one. Don't go. I don't want you to go. - Oh, don't go. - Mwah. Don't go. Holly and I are dating. It's been a week, and I still can't believe it. It goes to show that everything you want in life, you get. And you can't work for it. It just comes to you. And what do we have here? From my secret admirer. That's you. Come on. I dominate Valentine's day. I practically make romance into a science. "Roses are red. Violets are blue. Look in the vase to find your first clue." Oh, my gosh. It's a romantic scavenger hunt. Oh, close. It's a romantic treasure hunt. A scavenger hunt is where you find items from a master list. This is where you follow the clues that lead to a prize. Common misuse. Good luck. But there's no clue. Well, get to work. I can't, 'cause there's no clue. The puzzle is the clue. Are these numbers correct? The numbers are correct, Michael. Okay. Are you are you sick, Oscar? Do you need to go home? 'Cause you're grossing me out. I just need a signature. There you go. Thanks. Thank you. How much did you give him? - Big tip. - Wait. I don't have my scarf. What? I'm missing my scarf. We decided to have a Valentine's day lunch and then that way we can spend the entire night with Cece and avoid the Valentine's day dinner thing. It's a whole thing. - Yeah, lunch was wonderful! - Shh. Um, there was an amazing buffet and there was a chocolate fondueStation. And what else was there? Um, bottomless champagne. Yes. Never found that bottom, did we? No. What's up? Are you good at jigsaw puzzles? Are you kidding me? It's all I did every summer when my brothers were out sailing. Okay. But if this is a romantic thing with Gabe, I should probably oh! No, no, no, no. It's not weird at all. You have your new girlfriend. I have Gabe. This is just as friends. Well, okay then. Yes! At least until Stanley calms down. - Oh, is he - D-d-d-d-d-don't look. I accidentally did his sudoku. Andy. All right. I will fax over it to you. Whoop. I will fax it over to you. Okay. Thank you. Okay, my name is j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-Jim Halpert and I will fax it in to you under you. I'll fax it under you. Oh, excuse me. I just p-p-p-p-pissed my pants. Not really. I didn't really. Wait. You're just filling that out right now. That wasn't meant for me. I will not be your Valentine. Aww, nuts. I don't know if anyone else feels this way and don't get me wrong I love Michael and Holly. And maybe I'm being overly sensitive But the PDA. Yes! The freaking PDA! - Uh-huh. - Thank you! I mean, I'm thrilled for them. No one is more thrilled for them than I am Yes. Yes, absolutely. But it's totally inappropriate. Yeah, it's a little much. Obviously so happy for them both. So happy. Yeah. I don't know, guys. I, for one, enjoy watching them, because - No, stop. Just don't. - Kevin! Can I finish? Can I finish? Is that okay? I was saying I enjoy watching them because it makes me horny. God! Kevin! So tell me about your new girlfriend. She's neat. Uh, I met her at Darryl's cousin's party. We were the only two white people there. Aww, cute. Hey, look at that. Done. That's Gabe's boom box. Come on. We have to go find it. I wish you well on your quest. - No, come on. - Aww, I mean come on! - Okay. - Ha! I hear them kissing all the time. It's this horrible plipping sound. You know, it's like Chinese water torture. Just Like it's coming from my own head. Sit. Okay, just close your eyes. Ohh. Can you get lower? - Oh, yeah. - A little lower. I cannot keep myself from Michael. Everything he does is sexy. He has this undeniable animal magnetism. He's a jungle cat. The man exudes sex. He can put both his legs behind his head. Thank you all for meeting on such short notice. Yes? Yes. Michael Scott, Dunder Mifflin. What is the purpose of this meeting? Seeing as it's Valentine's day, I felt it would be apropos to have a little refresher course on romance in the workplace. Perfect. Yes. It is quite apro-propriate. Carry on. First things first. An office romance is permissible. Not something you'd expect to hear from corporate? Well, guess what. Sabre is 100% tolerant of office romances. Speaking of, Gabe, I don't see Erin at this meeting. Uh, I also don't see Andy. Boom! Face! I get it. Andy's slamming my girlfriend. Very funny. What I do not approve of, however, is public displays of affection, or PDAs. PDAs are totally superfluous to a happy, healthy office romance. Perfect example. Look at Jim and Pam. Yeah? What? Us? They don't touch. They don't kiss. You would hardly even know that they were husband and wife. - Did it. - Yeah! Love it. Keep going. Okay. So, PDAs. That's gonna include behaviors such as hugging, kissing, Booby honking. Yeah, booby honking. Sure. Butt honking. Butt honking. Yeah, all the honkings. The one where you start in a crouched position, then you leap Sure. Basically, there's no precise definition, but you know it when you see it. Are you guys listening to this? What, are you talking about me and Holly? Yeah! Maybe you find your own chair. So we kiss occasionally Occasionally? All the time. Yeah, and it's not just the kissing. It's the flirtatious whispering. The flirtatious tickling. Whispering and tickling have their place in business. That thing where you softly exhale on her neck. Okay, yeah, that's pretty hot. I will give you that. Look, you are all hypocrites. You all do it. Michael. I have done PDA in the office. Thank you. I've had intercourse in the office. - All right. - As has Angela. - Dwight. - As has Ryan. As has Kelly. As has Meredith. As has Phyllis. As has Darryl. As has creed. As has Michael. And as has Holly. As has Kevin. With who? She goes to another school. Okay. Fine. No more PDA. - Good. - You win. But here's what we are gonna do. We are going to designate one of our closets as a hook-up zone. - No. - Anything goes. Just leave it how you said Michael, that's absurd. What if two couples want to go at the same time? Okay, then we have two closets. No, no, we're gonna have three closets, one for each base, no homers. Yes? - And what is the hook-up zone policy on masturbation? - Pro. - Yes. What? Problem solved. No, no, it's great. I love working at Dunder Mifflin, a division of Taliban enterprises. That is weird. I mean, that's weird to have sex in the office. That's where you work, right? You know, you're in a meeting, and nobody knows that you've had sex there, except for you and him. Don't mind us. You keep working. Okay. I'll keep working. Oh, my God. It's a song. What do you think is on it? We should actually probably talk about it outside or we might make Darryl mad. Not if we're talking like this. I think it's okay. He doesn't seem to hear us. I think he's just being nice. That makes sense, 'cause I feel like I'd be able to hear us at this level. Darryl. Darryl is a jerk. - No, he's not. - No, I'm just testing if he can hear. I can hear you. - Oh. Okay. - Okay. Then no more talking. Let's just play the song.  The temp at night   the temp at night   the temp at night   the temp at night  Temp at night? What do you you got it. Pick it up. Take it out. Pi - pick it up. - Okay. Take it out. Pick it up. Pick it up. Pick it up. Take it out. Right. Okay. Sorry to interrupt. Forgot to collect my things. Ah, the old "leave behind." Oldest trick in the book. Good thing it's working. Oh, no. Michael, I don't want to make people uncomfortable. Since when is comfort the most important thing? I mean, I don't sit on your lap because it's comfortable. I sit on your lap because I like the way your thighs feel on my butt. Yeah, but if they're uncomfortable, it makes me uncomfortable. Oh. Okay. Well, if it makes you uncomfortable, then we'll stop. Okay. Holly and I are like Romeo and Juliet. And this office is like the dragon that kept them apart. Hey. You know the only reason why people here are complaining? They are jealous of two people in love on Valentine's day. Two people in love? I love you. Wait, wait, wait, what do you mean you love me? We've only been dating for a week. Do you mean you love me like, "oh, hey, there's Holly. I love that girl," or do you mean you love me like you love me-love me? - I love you-love you. - Wow, you love me-love me. I love you-love you. I am really disappointed in the office's policy on PDA at this moment. I love you. I love you. Yeah, whatever. No big deal. Just the hottest girl in the world loves me. Okay, Ryan's the temp. What does he do at night? I guess we just have to wait until night and see. Oh. Or maybe not. Cool. - How romantic is this? - Super romantic. Right? Do you see a clue or Yeah. Did you not see it? - Oh, my gosh. - Hanks. Hey. No time to chat. - Sorry. - Well, we were just looking for Ryan, so he's not here. Hey. You're looking for me? Oh, yeah, we were. We were just looking to say hi. So hey. - No, you weren't. - No, we weren't. You wanted to have sex in my office. - No. - Definitely not. That's disgusting. It's cool. Just try to put everything back where you found it. Text me when you're finished. I'll be out here. Hey, you don't have to That was so embarrassing I'm gonna die. That was really rough. Let me make something clear. Jim and I have never and will never have sex in the office. No, because the office isn't what I'd consider a romantic place. Besides, we have something those other people don't have, which is a home and a bed. And a shower. - Hello, Holly. - Hello. Here, shake no! - No, don't touch. - No, we can't. - No touching. - No touching. Ah, I'm trying not to touch you. - Almost got you. - Oh, no, so close. Oh. No, we can't do that. We can't do this. Ohh. You're not touching me. I don't know what your body feels like. 'Cause I can't touch it. Okay, this is much worse than before. Yeah, I agree. This is nasty. - Grab you here. - And here. And I will grab you here anyway. You have to cut it out. - Never. - Okay. You said you would. I did say I would, but I was wrong. I can't stop. You don't know what it is like to love a woman and have her love you back. It is a feeling that cannot and will not and frankly cannot be contained. No one is a bigger fan of sexual touching than me. But with you two, it's reaching the level of a complex. I can think of three explanations. You're taking MDMA street name, ecstasy. I've done it, and I know the feeling. No. I don't think so. You're desperately trying to fit in a whole relationship before Toby comes back from jury duty and Holly has to go back to nashua. You're at an age where your sexual climaxes aren't as powerful so you need to overcompensate with foreplay, taboo behavior. Yes, it was that. It's that one. Yes. Number three. Give me all your money and take off your clothes. We're not supposed to PDA. Come on. Nobody's looking. What's wrong? I hadn't thought about you having to go back to nashua. Maybe we didn't want to think about it. We can make it work. We'll date long-distance. That's what we said last time. Remember? We broke up on the drive. How's this gonna be any different? We weren't in love last time. I was in love with you. I'm not saying it won't be hard. But we can make it work. That's what she said. One Erin special, please. Here's your bottle of sparkling cider. That's my favorite. I'm now supposed to tell you to enjoy a mid-hunt break and look for a heart or some [Bleep] In the break room when you're through. Hey, buck up, buddy. Make that face he likes. Hey. Hey. Come on. You're hurting him. It's like a time bomb - Shh. - Is ticking down. When it goes off, no more kissing. No more hugging. Just hush. Sexual time bomb. Just rock. Shh. Boner bomb starring Jason Statham. Or we go against type with an Eisenberg or a Michael Cera. - Movie idea? - No. Saving the world has never been this hard. Okay. Shh. Have you talked to her about our feelings? Women really go for that crap. No, I can't talk to her. I can't even look at her without thinking about it ending. Kevin. Do more stupid faces. Which one? I have a lot of stupid faces. - I don't know. - Do the monkey face. - Do a monkey face. - I love that. I love that face. Good. He loves it. Good. Jump. Jump up and down. - No. The monkey! - Go back to the monkey. Don't do the squirrel. Throw your poop. Hurl your feces. That's good. - Good. - That's good. He's throwing it. They really do that. I know. - B-9. - B-9. Like benign tumor. Maybe it's just more like, "be mine." Oh, yes. There's a note. "A little cookie for you, my miss. But the real treasure is your Valentine's kiss." Oh. We're supposed to Holly. Hey. - Hi. - Holly, I love you so, so, so much. And I think that we need to break up. What? What are you talking about? Actually it's Valentine's day. Shouldn't be doing this today. I'll talk to you tomorrow. No, we're gonna talk now. You're not breaking up with me. You're gonna go back to nashua eventually, and I can't handle it. So let's just let's what if I said it wasn't up to them? - Who? - The company. Nobody knows our future, but it's not gonna be decided by the company. It's not gonna be decided by anybody but us. What we are is up to you and me. Okay. Okay. Ladies and gentlemen, I have an announcement to make. As of today, officially, Holly and I are moving in together. Thank you. Thank you. Oscar, this must be tough for you, watching this go down. You could not stand in the way of true love, my friend. Are you kidding? I wasn't trying to break you guys up. Better luck next time, pal. Well, the point is, there will no longer be any need for PDA here at the office between us because, when we get home, we are going to make love to and with one another, and that, to me, is the best Valentine's day present that a person could receive. So I bid you all adieu. - You do? - I do. Go on. Kiss each other already. Suck it, Oscar. This must kill you. I just told them to do it. - What? - No. No. We took a walk. We took a walk. My perfect Valentine's day? I'm at home, three cell phones in front of me, fielding desperate calls from people who want to buy one of the 50 restaurant reservations I made over six months ago. Anybody can be prince charming one day a year with the dinner and the flowers and all that. But you know what impresses me? When a guy can do that no days a year. Flowers, diamonds, three course meal Violinist comes to my table to serenate me Pizza, soda, the moon, someone to share it with What are our plans for tonight?   I got a delivery for you. Leave it at reception. I'm supposed to deliver this one in person. Clean up on aisle five. After three years of writing, one year of shooting, four years of reshooting, and two years of editing, I have finally completed my movie, Threat Level Midnight. [Cheerful music] - Erin, Erin - Yes? - What are you doing? - Guys Did you guys know that our own Michael Scott has made a movie and that he maybe will let us watch it, but only if everybody's dying to see it? That's Well, don't put words in my mouth. Threat Level Midnight is the great lost film of Michael Scott. We're all in it, from, like, years and years ago. It's like a home movie. Yeah, if Michael Scott did your home movie. Michael screened a work in progress for us years ago, and it didn't go well. We thought it was a comedy. Everything pointed to it being a comedy. - Yep. - We'd love to see it. Sweet. I will go invite Holly. Okay, everyone, I know we're really excited to see this movie that everybody's in, but we have to remember that Michael is sensitive. So let's stay positive And no laughing, no comments, just positive energy, and we'll have a pure fun day, okay? Thanks, mom. You never told me you made a movie. Mm-hmm. It's got action. It's got heart. It's got symbolism. - It's got you. - It's got a lot of me. I can't wait. Ladies and gentlemen, Threat Level Midnight. [Upbeat dramatic music, cheers and applause]   Michael Scarn? Well, that is an interesting story. He was once the best secret agent in the business. That was years ago. Where is he now? Well, that's also an interesting story. Master Scarn. Master Scarn! I play Samuel, Michael Scarn's robot butler. I wanted Samuel's voice [Robotic voice] To be like this. But Michael thought that Samuel should be a very advanced android, almost indistinguishable from a real person. Dwight does not play a robot. - I'm up. - It's the president. - He needs you for a mission. - Tell him I'm retired. It's Goldenface. Goldenface This makes it personal. [Dramatic music]   Scarn, you're right on time. [Cheers and applause] - Hail to the chief. - I gave up a lot of weekends because I thought it would be good for my daughter to see a black man as president, even in a silly home movie. What a stupid waste of time. It's your old enemy, Goldenface. He's after the NHL all-star game. He's hidden a bomb somewhere in the stadium. Scarn This one is personal for me. I own the stadium. I can't see it blown up. It's my retirement plan. We have to search the stadium. Not so fast Goldenface has taken all of the concession-stand workers hostage. Scarn, will you find these hostages and save the game? Heads I do it, tails I don't. Best out of seven. Heads. [Dramatic music] Tails.   Heads. Tails. Heads. Tails. Looks like there's gonna be a clean up on aisle five. [Cheers and applause] Well, the hostages were scared. Don't you guys get it? Nobody's coming for us. Oh, someone's coming, all right. The only man who would care, Michael Scarn. [Cheers and applause] See, I'm gonna lure him here. Then I'm gonna kill everybody. Then I'm gonna dig up Scarn's dead wife, and I'm gonna hump her real good. [Laughing evilly] I did not love the dialogue Or the character. I took the role to impress a receptionist who will remain nameless. Well, the all-star game was three days away. The only way Scarn was getting in was in a uniform. Just one problem with that Scarn didn't know a hockey stick from a slim Jim. So he went to meet with the famed trainer, Cherokee Jack. Mop the ice. I'm not here to learn how to mop, I'm here to learn how to play hockey. Mop it. [Inspirational rock music]  Oh   I get no traction 'cause I'm running on ice   it's taking me twice as long   can't have a reaction 'cause I'm running on ice  Come on. Come on.    You got to run, run, run, oh   oh-oh-oh-oh-oh   you run, you run, you run, run, run, oh   oh-oh-oh-oh-oh  - Now take this. -  Running on ice  What am I supposed to do with this? -  Running on ice  - Mop.  Running, running on ice   running on ice  Well, Michael Scarn was quickly becoming one of the hottest hockey players in the country. Each year the national hockey league accepts one civilian amateur to play in the all-star game. It's down to the three of you. The final test is speed skating. On your marks Get set Die. [Gunshot] [Dramatic music]   [Breathing heavily] Nice try, Goldenface, except you forgot one thing to kill me. Oh, I wasn't trying to kill you. I was trying to slow you down. No! - Oh, by the way - Yeah? How's your wife doing? [Laughing evilly] Congratulations. Hey, you came in second Not bad either, champ. I'm so sorry I have to do this. Shh! Shh, shh! [Choking] [Grunts] I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm intercepting a name Jasmine Windsong. She works for Goldenface. But what I can't figure out is, who is the Funky Cat? Not who, what. The Funky Cat is the hippest jazz club in town. Oh! Oh, n [jazz music]   He cut the part where my circuit board malfunctioned? Then what was the point of spilling the drink on me?  They call me   Jasmine Windsong  Bingo. He finished his movie? No kidding. Wow. That's great. Yeah, good for him. [Singing unintelligibly]   [Click]  The hostages are under the stadium  Ooh, ugh! [Choking] [All murmur] Ugh. Check, please. You have to let us go, Goldenface. - We have families. - Ha, this is gonna show them That I mean business. See ya. Far and away the most expensive shot of the movie, but it was "intregral" to the story. Ha! It's Scarn! Sorry about your friend, Scarn. The joke's on you, Goldenface. That man was a wanted animal rapist. We've searched the whole building, Goldenface. - Where is the bomb? - Hmm? We've searched the whole building, Goldenface. - Where is the bomb? - Hmm? We've searched the Okay. He said, "Where is the bomb?" In the puck. But why are you telling me this? Because I'm going to kill you, unless You forgive me for murdering your wife. [Soft emotional music]   - Hey, Goldenface. - Yeah? Go puck yourself. No! That was not scripted. [Gun cocks] [Gasps] [Gunshot] [Soft emotional music] [Weakly] More Tylenol. You've already had four. Oh, God! So good. You're lucky to be alive. It'll take a lot more than a bullet to the brain, lungs, heart, back, and balls to kill Michael Scarn. Let's just make sure that everything's working properly. [Monitor beeping slowly] [Beeping quickens] You just said the bomb is in the puck? Both: Yes. Is that where you hid the bomb, Goldenface? But why would you blow up the stadium? You own the stadium. For the insurance money I knew it all along. You will never get away with this. [Chuckles evilly] [Gunfire] Where had I gone wrong? All I wanted was to start a family with my beautiful wife. But somewhere along the way, things got messed up. It wasn't easy for Scarn to admit that he'd lost his self-confidence. And he hadn't, of course. He just wasn't using it right now. All: Mike! Beer me, Billy. You don't look so good. What's got you down? I got problems, Billy, big problems. You got problems? My TV don't work. I pay 30 bucks a month for the damn satellite "Whatsahoozit." I can't even get the damn game. Now, you tell me, what's worse than that? [Chuckles] Don't ever change, Billy. [Chuckles] Goldenface is going to blow up the NHL all-star game tomorrow. I see what you mean about problems. I know what'll cheer you up. That table of bachelorettes over there bought you this drink. All: Hey. Ever banged an entire bachelorette party, baby? Why are you singling my line out, like, a million years later? I'm too depressed to save the big game, Billy. I'm gonna cheer you up the only ways I know hows. Hey, kid Hit G-9 on the jukebox. No, Billy, I haven't done that dance since my wife died. There's a whole crowd of people out there who need to learn how to do the Scarn. [Funky music]    Well, my name's Michael Scarn   and I'm here to say   I'm about to do the Scarn in a major way     you jump to the right, and you shake a hand   then you jump to the left, and you shake that hand   you meet new friends, you tie some yarn   and that's how you do the Scarn  All:  You jump to the right, and you shake a hand   then you jump to the left, and you shake that hand   meet new friends, tie that yarn   that's how you do the Scarn   you jump to the right and  [Chuckles] Shh. Stop. All:  And you shake that hand   meet new friends, tie that yarn  -  that's how you do the Scarn  - Boom! If doing the Scarn is gay, then I'm the biggest queer on earth! - [Laughs, snorts] - You guys, I think I have - I'm really sorry. - My self-confidence back. [All cheering, video pauses] - Hey, hey. - Michael! Michael, I'm sorry. I'm really, really sorry. I think I was just relieved to see that Michael Scarn got his confidence back. Yeah, Michael, the movie's amazing. It's, like, one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life. You should enter it in festivals. - Or carnivals. - Yeah. Well, that's a pretty good reaction. That's pretty cool, right? Did you like it? Did you like that? Which part? Okay. - All right. - Oh, come on. No. All: Michael. - No, come on! - We have to see the end. No, it's not good enough. It's not good enough. Some people are really popping on-screen. - Hey. - Hey. - Good movie. - Mm, good? Everybody out there says it's great. - I loved it. - Did you? - What did you love about it? - Um I loved that you got to work together with all your friends. - Mm-hmm. - Isn't that so great when you can all work together like that? No, no. Holly, this isn't Oean's Eleven, where you get together with all your friends, and you just have fun, and you don't care about how it turns out. What'd you really think, honestly? Um Is it is it because you're afraid of where this is gonna take me? Because, see, I need you to keep me grounded. I'm not worried about that. This is 11 years, okay? This has been my dream for 11 years And if you don't think it's great, then you're basically saying you don't believe in my dream. It's your dream? You never even mentioned it before. We talk about a lot of things, Holly. You know, I was eventually going to get around to my dream, obviously. that I could've been working on the Scarn Nebulus. Well, why do you have to make a movie at all? Because if I don't have this, what do I have? - I have nothing. - Really? You can't think of anything else that you might have? I have my book on business, somehow I manage. I have my HBO Comedy Special, here I go again, dot, dot, dot. But you know what? When I think about it, when I really think about it, none of those things are as real to me as my movie. I'm real. Yeah, you're a real pain in the ass. And now I'm gonna go watch the movie with people who think it's great. And I'm sorry I called you a pain in the ass. I'm angry, and I love you. I love you too. I'm a huge Woody Allen fan Although I've only seen Antz. But I'll tell you something What I respect about that man is that when he was going through all of that stuff that came out in the press About how Antz was just a rip-off of A Bug's Life, he stayed true to his films Or at least the film that I saw, which, again, was Antz. Thing is I thought Bug's Life was better, much better than Antz. Point is, don't listen to your critics. Listen to your fans. Who likes Threat Level Midnight? [Cheers and applause] Okay, well, then who wants to watch the rest? [Cheers and applause] [Dramatic music] Michael, you have to get to that puck before halftime, or the whole stadium will explode. I know. It's a good thing my trainer and mentor - is here to cheer me on. - Cherokee Jack? Michael, he died. [Sad music]   This one's for you, Cherokee Jack. We filmed this during an actual Scranton High School hockey game. They were trying to qualify for States. Shh. It's fine. It's great. No, no, actually it was really screwed up, because they they were trying to qualify. They were disqualified. They had to forfeit the game. Undefeated season That's why there were so many people there. [Sad music] - Why is your face gold? - Why do you care? I'm just making conversation. I worked in a gold factory. We had a boss who only cared about money. He wouldn't give us lunch breaks, so we had to - Hey. - Hey, I'm sorry. - It is good. - No, no, it's not. It's not. But they really seem to be enjoying it. - [Laughs] - Come on. Please, Goldenface, let us go! [Dramatic music] Cherokee Jack. I want you to take all your frustrations with women, the system, with everything take it out on the puck, all on the puck. [Laughing] [Dramatic music]   [Laughing] - Yah! - Aah! - Oh! - Yay! - Yay, they're saved! - Whoo!   Hey, we got sports games again. [All cheering] [Laughing] Oh, sh [explosion] [Cheers and applause] Some breakfast for me, some breakfast for you. [Laughter] Aw. Oh, yeah, I guess I did let him be a robot. [Phone rings] I'll get it. Man, I love being retired. Scarn here. - Michael, it's the president. - Hello, sir. I need you for another mission. Uh Yeah, I'm in. [Cheers and applause] Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. Isn't the president evil? Oh, yeah. [Laughs] Yes, he is. No, no, he's doing it to catch the president. No, no, Dwight, he's just being stupid. [Laughter] Well, Michael Scarn was back in the game. And I bet you're wondering why do I know so much about Michael Scarn? Well, because I am Michael Scarn. All: Oh! [Applause] That was so good. [Groovy music] Aw, yeah!   I have the best stock survival shelter in north eastern Pennsylvania. But everything is a **life. So I must eat and then replace everything that is about to expire. It's nice not to have to plan my meals. You're eating eight-year-old tomatoes. They're still good for another week. You know, I think I might have some type of cheese in the back of my fridge you might like. I've got some cheese you might like too In between my toes. Hardy-har-har. All right, picture this. Snowy Ash drizzles from the sky. A rabid pack of dogs surrounds you as the flame at the end of your stick dies out. There's only one hope left for you the door to my shelter. You pound. You beg. "Dwight, please let me in." But I ignore your cries and do not let you in. You want to know why? Because of the sign that says, "no pounding. No begging." No. Because you laughed at me. Kevin will be eaten. Pam will be taken slave. Jim will be made a warlord's Jester. Meredith will do okay. Be assured this day will come. It's just a matter of time. Could be one month, could be two months. Three months. - Could be. - Four months. I could see that happening, yes. Eight months? That's a realistic timeline. Perhaps. Okay, wait, now really think hard about this one. One year. I could see that as a very real possibility. I could see that happening. That's just I really thought I was becoming too much of a womanizer. I realized I had shirts in five different women's houses. Still not seeing the problem there. All right. Truth is, I got a couple love bumps on my ding-dong, so I was like, "oh, game over." It was the best of times. It was the "awesomest" of times. And now packer wants to come home. And, oh, look who's here to sign off on it my boo, Holly. Hi. Hi. You must be Todd. Whoa, I'm sorry. Michael, I thought we were meeting Holly today, not Jennifer Aniston. Very funny. Okay, let's get started. After you. Okay. Oh, Michael, this'll be just us. Ah, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Just so you know, he's at his funniest when you've given him, like, five shots. - Okay. - And it also helps if you've had five shots. I already have. Why is packer back? Oh, is packer here? Why is he talking to Holly? Don't know, don't care. Michael loves you, and your sales speak for themselves. So Oh! Yes! The pack is back. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to introduce you to a man who needs no introduction, probably because most of you have done it with him. Just kidding. He wouldn't be interested in any of you. In all seriousness, Todd packer is a permanent salesman at this branch. And I would like to invite you now to welcome him with open arms. Yes! What? It's great to be among friends. And until then, you suckers will do. Nice. We got burned. You did. You got burned, because packer's back. Packer is turning in his car for a desk. He is turning in his condoms for a condominium, although he's probably going to have to use condoms from here on out. Holly You approved this? Yes, I did. I think Todd's gonna make a great addition to the staff. - You did approve it? - Yeah. What don't you understand about the word "approved"? It seems a couple of you don't know what the word "approved" means. I have very little patience for stupidity. Sorry we're late. Gabe fell in the shower. Such a klutz. Yeah, and it took the fire department forever to get there. Oh, my God. Where did this come from? Who did this? I got Erin a new computer because the one at reception sucked. I should know. And I don't want to say the other one was old, but its I.P. Number was one. Right? Thank you, Pam. Aw, you're welcome. My pleasure. Can I do something for you? I just helped someone out. It feels good. Nice. You know, I cleaned up our daughter for, like, an hour at 4:00 A.M. This morning, so So you know the feeling. Special delivery for Dwight k. Schrute. I didn't order anything. And I don't have anything for you. But I do want to talk to you about something. We have been thinking about where packer should sit, and we can't just sit around waiting for creed to die. Well, there's a lot of seats in the annex. So you wouldn't mind permanently relocating so that packer can take this desk here. Thanks, man. It would mean a lot to me. I've been sitting here for ten years, Michael. Well, I was there for 12 years. Plus, my name's carved under the desk. - No, it is not. - It is too. - Where? - Right there. Check it out. Michael, I don't want to move desks. Don't be a baby. We're okay, there it is. "Packer was here and so was your mom." - Yeah. - Do I have any say in this? No! It's $20 to watch, Halpert. Oh. Hey. Whose dirt box is this? That's our zen garden. What do you grow in here, bull crap? Hey, Holly. Hey. What's up, guys? Don't "what's up?" Us. You think you're so cute with your pretty blond hair. Whoa, whoa. Pull it back. Um, why did you hire Todd packer? He's seriously awful. Michael's recommendation was glowing. Honestly, he's been nothing but nice to me. That's how he gets you to take off your panties. - Why are you nodding? - United front. Okay, look, we can't fire someone because we don't like him. Right. This isn't the U.S. government. What are you referencing? Everything. Everything. Do any of you have any concrete complaints about something he's done? Well, I mean, he humped Michael. Well, if that's the case, I guess I've got to be fired too. Hey. Hey, you guys. The yarmouth regatta video is up. Gather round. Check it out. This guy's on a full beam reach. They're hiking out like mad. Luff him up. Luff him up. Nice ah! This computer's a hunk of junk. Hey, sailor, come watch your regatta over here. Where did you get this? Pam gave it to me. This is a sick computer. Gwen Stefani has this computer. Uh, Pamela. Yep? What does a guy have to do to whom to get one of them? You have a computer, Andy. Yeah, but if you donated my computer to Africa, it would become famous as the slowest computer in Africa. Okay, listen, we just don't have the budget for it, okay? Reception needed a computer, so we got one. Well, Andy's desk needs a computer. And, I mean, it's just kind of a coincidence that I work there, but Yes, but reception is a one-person department. If I get you a new computer, I have to get one for everyone in sales for Dwight, for Stanley. It would be crazy. So something good happening to Stanley is crazy now. They're not asking for one. I am. I-I need it. If you're just handing them out, I want one too. Phyllis, nobody's handing anything out. See, that's what I'm talking about. What, are you gonna play mah-jongg faster? I'm sorry, Andy. Hey, what's going on, you guys? Yeah. Three muske-queers. Mean, but good. So, Todd, this must be nice for you, getting off the road. You get to spend some time with your daughter. I don't know. I love her and all, but she's turned into a bitch. Most days she's great, but some days she acts like her mom. Well, some girls go through a phase. Yeah. Your life is so insane. You should write a book. Since when did you learn how to read? I do know how to read, though. Yeah. You know how to read a menu. This guy. I He's right. I mean, I could lose some weight. Kevin, in sumo culture, you'd be considered a promising up-and-comer. What the heck? Why do you have Erin's computer? It's crazy, right? Erin just wanted me to have it, so we switched. What? Erin, is that true? I just thought he seemed to really need a new computer, and he knows so much about that one. Erin, it's not up to you. This computer was for reception, okay? It's not yours to give away. Pam. When I'm freaking out, I just sort of step back, take three deep breaths. I'm not freaking out. Okay? And then I ask myself, "is this worth freaking out about?" Andy, why should she have your crappy computer? Oh, that's interesting. So you also think my computer's crappy. Switch the computers back, Andy. - Seriously? - Seriously. Pam, come on. Now, please. Fine! Please make sure nobody is humping me. Oh, if you're going back to the annex, could you take these to Dwight? I think the ants are waking up. They need to start farming soon. Thanks. Best day ever. Best day ever. So much is happening. Oh. Question should I get stripes shaved into the side of my head? No. No. Please. Did Todd tell you to do that? - Yes. - Yeah. You love him, right? You love him. I can tell. - I love you. - No, no, not me. Him. What? He's certainly opinionated. If you're not gonna take the ants over, I should probably just do it myself. - Oh, I'm going. - Whoa, no. Are you jealous of him Because you think he's funnier than you? Honey. I don't think he's funnier than me. Oh, he's funnier than me. He's not funny at all. So I'm less funny than not funny at all? Uh-oh, I think the ants are starting to eat each other. No, what I'm saying is he's not funny, but you're funnier than he is. Um Okay, bill cosby, Steve Martin, Charlie bit my finger, Michael Scott, then all the way down here, Todd packer. That's insane. Honey, he's a jerk. Oh, for Pete's sake, it just needs to be done. So you two are married now, right? - Yeah. - That's sweet. How's the sex? - Yeah. - Hey, packer I made you some hot chocolate. Why? 'Cause I want to let bygones be bygones, show you I'm cool. You're the new guy. It's cold out. I made too much. I got this awesome hot-chocolate recipe from my wife. That's a lot of reasons. Drink it. I think I'll pass. The only hot chocolate I'm into is Vivica A. Fox. Can I talk to you for a second? - Here. - Okay. Okay. So this hot-chocolate thing with packer None of your business. Well, you know you can't actually poison him. Right? It isn't poison. It's a laxative. People take laxatives all the time. This is just a lot more of a laxative. Let me handle it. I really think we should join forces on this one. - Really? - What do we think? What would drive him crazy? - I know. - Here we go. Pepto-bismol in his hot chocolate. You have got to stop with the hot-chocolate stuff. Okay. I was thinking maybe we could jam his drawers so that they only come out two inches. Then, that way, you can see everything in them, but you can't get at it. Does Edgar Allen poe know about that one? So sinister. That wouldn't annoy a person at all. Where do you come up with this stuff? All right, well, this isn't my best, but call froggy 101, say that we're the tour manager for Justin Bieber, and we're giving away free tickets. We give 'em a number to call for the tickets, and it's his number. Who is justice beaver? He it's a crime-fighting beaver. Why don't you write up your best 40 ideas and email 'em to me can you do that? Absolutely. I'll email you 100. Yeah. Write up your list of 100, edit it down to your top 40, and I'll read it over. Pam, can I talk to you in private? I don't know if there's really a private place in this office. Well, I put a sign-up sheet in the conference room, and I signed us up for three mods. A mod is five minutes, and it started two minutes ago, so You did that? Can we talk about this in the meeting? 'Cause we're already late. Okay. Wow, when did people sign up for that? - Mind if I close the door? - No. What you did out there earlier was totally uncool. Well, what I was supposed to do, huh let you walk all over me? You humiliated me in front of everybody. Okay, well, I didn't think about it like that. It's just I can't do anything about it. I can't replace your computer unless that one breaks. Well, I mean, it's pretty broken already. Well, if it breaks all the way, I can get you a new one. Pretty sneaky, sis. Hey, cats, we got a jam session in mods 6, 9, and 12. There are 400 of these. Yeah, I couldn't cut it down. They're all good. So good. "Number three eat a frog." That sounds promising. "Number four eat a dog." I don't know, um, from a practical standpoint Did you like 135? "Eat a brog." Maybe it's 'cause I didn't understand it. I just had a couple of notes. Let me grab a pen and Damn it. Ah, just when we were just when we were getting going. Allow all cookies? Why, "soitenly." Pop-ups? Yes, please. Bit torrent streaming from a Somalian music website? Yeah, why not? Oh, I hope you don't get sick, Mr. computer. Why are you doing this to me, Andy? Because I hate your broke ass. And a 76ers fan to boot. I like that. And you made Hank smile. That doesn't happen often. You're very charming. You know what? That is something that you should take upstairs and use on the people that really matter. - Why? - I don't know. Holly mentioned that there were some complaints and that you had said some things about Kevin. - Holly said that? - Yeah. She was laughing hysterically the whole time. I guess you said something weird about your daughter. She asked me, Michael. It would have been rude not to answer. You've been on the road a long time. And you've been an outdoor cat. And now you have to be an indoor cat, so you can't be peeing all over the walls. Michael, can I open the kimono with you? I've been on the road too long. But I want to connect with my daughter. And it's not right to call her a bitch in front of strangers. No, it isn't. You're right. I got to I got to watch my behavior. Yeah, a little bit. Don't give up on me. I won't. Okay. Everybody? I need you to see this, because maybe there is somebody here that you underestimated who will surprise you. Todd packer is going to apologize. Kevin, front and center come here. I got a lot of numbers here to put together. Kevin, we know that you are just trying to save face. We know that you are hurt and embarrassed. That's silly. I should be apologizing to packer, 'cause everybody knows that I can dish it as good as I can take it. Okay, sweetie, no, you shouldn't be apologizing to packer. That doesn't make any sense. You ready for this? Are you ready for this? - Mm-hmm. Gentlemen, start your engines. I'm sorry if you were offended by my comments earlier. Well, like I said, I wasn't offended, but I'll stand here for the big show. Kevin, do you accept the apology? Don't do it, Kevin. That's that fake kind of apology. - Okay, go back to the annex. - This is textbook. It's so uncool. Ryan does this to me all the time, like it's some offense to have feelings. Don't do it, Kevin. Sometimes you overreact. Michael, how is this supposed to work? Packer's gonna keep saying terrible things, and then he's just gonna make half-ass apologies, and we're back to square one. Okay. You want an apology? Here goes. Kevin, I am so sorry. You are skinny, and you're a genius. That that was maybe too much. Packer is a survivor of divorce, Stanley. Packer doesn't speak with his child, Meredith. Packer never lived up to his parents' expectations, Andy. Angela loves pussycats. Packers loves - No, don't. - I was going to say "dogs"! Okay, you know what? This is over. Apology has been issued, and we're through with it. Packer's going to be here until the day he dies, just like the rest of us. So, listen, we have to really scuff this up. No, no, no, we can say that the previous owner was a neat freak or an elegant old lady, and she just kept it around in case her grandkids came to visit. But they died, and they never came. I'm gonna make myself cry. Andy, this is the deal we made. That's probably good. That's enough. We should break this hinge maybe. Let's not go crazy. Well, thanks. Will do. Absolutely. Now, when you get down there, Jo's a little bit, uh, forgetful, so she may have locked the gate, but what you're gonna do is, go ahead, hop it, and just head back to the pool. That sounds weird. It is weird. Look at you perceptive. Now I know why jo has kept her eye on you. And you make sure to get down there and check out the Harry Potter world. Whatever you want to do in your spare time is up to you. Harry Potter world is supposed to be fantastic. Apparently, as soon as corporate found out I wanted to come in off the road, jo offered me a cushy new job in Tallahassee. And here's the best part. I'm a huge alligator nerd. I can name you every genus, every subspecies. Also, I'm a huge boob nerd. Check it out and have a free butterbeer on us. Keep the receipt, and we'll get you back. What are you doing? Shh, this is a very important client. All right, so just pack your bags. And, uh, be sure to bring those swimming trunks. Bye, now. Bye. I cannot believe this. You're sending packer to Florida? Why? Because he's a jerk. - You gave him my desk. - Okay. So you're tricking him into flying to Florida. This wasn't my first choice. Jim had so many better ideas. You have to tell him. You have to tell him what you did. No, no, no, no, no, no. That that is not in the plan. That is actually anti what we're doing. He is my oldest friend. I am going to tell him. Wait. Why don't we come up with a plan that we're all happy about? Yeah, that Pam, how is this thing even any better than my old computer? Come on, Andy. I mean, you said you wanted a computer this is the best I could do. Where'd you even find this thing like, in the corner of the warehouse? Yes, I found it on a shelf in the corner of the warehouse. All right, well, thank you for my garbage computer. You're looking at the new face of corporate. Gonna put the "ass" in Tallahassee. Yes, about that Oh, man, we got to go out and celebrate tonight. Well, I don't know if that's a good idea. - The old ball and chain? - No. No. Nothing like that at all. Listen, I'm gonna tell you something that none of these people have the stones to tell you. It's your girlfriend. She's uptight. Sorry? I know this stuff can hurt, but I wish someone had said something to me about my ex-wife. All I'm saying is, in about a month or so, have you down to Florida, introduce you to all the local talent. Sounds great. Yeah. It's gonna be so good. That is. It's gonna be awesome. I think you're really going to enjoy it down there. I'm sorry about your friend. No. He's an ass. You are. You are. What are you, wicked smaht? No, you are. Saw Andy's new computer you found in the warehouse. Yep. Lucked out. Yeah, you really did, 'cause I know every inch of that warehouse. Yep. Super lucky. Maybe you could go back down there and see if you can find me some extra sick days. Yeah. You know what? I think I saw one sick day I think maybe I saw five. Three. I'm full on corrupt. Race fan, huh? No. Everybody assumes I am. I always get them as gifts. Oh. Dunder Mifflin is having our first ever garage sale. Like many Americans, we realized we had a lot of things that we didn't really need. And $.10 of every dollar is going into the party fund, so we can throw parties for ourselves. People, look alive! It's showtime! Doors open in three Two One! [Door buzzer] [Applause] Ooh, yikes. It's cold, Dwight! Just shut the door. Let people come in the front. It's good that it's cold. It'll drive business inside. The signs will drive business inside. The warmth will lure people inside. - Close it. - This is how business I'm not closing the doo Close it. No. Stop it. Just stop. Kevin, shut the door. [Cheerful music] Uh-oh. Looks like someone's sign's a little crooked. Ugh. It looks awful. You need a thumbtack? - Sure. - Not so fast. Schrutes are farmers by hobby, and traders by trade. Through the art of the swap, I will walk out of this garage sale with the finest item here. I will trade you for the used candle. Forget you. Come on. It's trash, like your sign, unless you have this. Fine. Just give it. That's how it's done. Whoa. I love her. How much for that? I, uh I actually don't know why I brought that, because it's kind of priceless. $10. Mmm, no. I paid $500 for that. - 200. - 500. - 20. - 45. - Get lost. - Damn it. And that is how you do it. You know, we don't have to sell that if you don't want. If it's a problem with the neon, I can have my neon guy take a look. No, you know, it's really more for a bachelor pad. I just want to get a fair price. Well, we could put it in storage in case. In case? In case of what? Well, you know, in case Maybe something changes. I don't have an "in case." Do you have an "in case"? No. How much for the slip n' slide? Get lost. Yes, hello, Mr. flax. This is Michael Scott, your daughter's boss. I am calling because I am going to have to fire your daughter Holly, because she's such a terrible employee. I'm just kidding. [Laughs] I'm kidding. I'm actually calling Because I'm in love with her. I love your daughter, and I have for some time. And I would like to discuss my intentions with you, which are to ask her to marry me. And I was just hoping that you would give me your approval. And this isn't a joke. So call me back when you get this, and I look forward to speaking. Thank you. Mmm. Are you serious? A half-used candle? Get out of here, Dwight. You're blocking my table with your giant body. Oh, 'cause there's a huge line of people who want your spinster tchotchkes. Screw you, man. People like my stuff. People like Ryan? Let me tell you about men like him. He comes over, and you're, like, "hey, baby, let me light a candle," and you pull out this one. Half-used. He's like, "who else is she seeing? I better lock her down fast." You can take my Helen fielding collection. And the Jennifer Weiner collection. Oh, my gosh. You have the Dallas board game? Yeah. When I was a kid, I was on Dallas. - Really? - Yeah. We missed our connecting flight, and we spent the entire day on Dallas. Then we spent a week on Hawaii. I was on heaven. We should play it. Well, there's no instructions. It's Dallas, the game. We can figure it out. Yeah. I'm pretty good at board games. Well, shall we make it a little interesting? Sure. What is this? How did those get out? I'm sorry. "Professor Copperfield's miracle legumes"? I was in Jamaica, and I got lost. And it was getting dark this one night, and then out of nowhere, this guy comes with a cart, and he's selling these. Dwight, he told me things about myself that there's no way he could have known. That's a common swindler's trick. Probably. Probably. So I buy some. I turn the corner. I feel like an idiot. So I go back to get my money. He was gone. So you want to sell me magic beans? [Laughs] Correction. I do not want to sell you Professor Copperfield's miracle legumes. Nice try. No, correction. Terrible try. Michael called dad? Your friend Michael, yes. What's going on? Um, I think I know, but I'll sound stupid if I'm wrong. Uh, is dad there? - Hollis? - Hi, dad. There was a program on tv about India. Oh, okay. Um, did you connect with Michael? You want to watch it? I I'm not there, dad. I'm in Pennsylvania. What what are you doing there? I live here. Um, can I talk to you about Michael? I'll I'll put your mother on. No, no, no, dad. Holly? Mom, dad can't seem to focus on the subject. Don't you worry about him. He's got me. Well, who do you have? I have your father. He's right here. I'll put him on. No, mom. Oh, which one's decaf? Michael! Michael! Hey! - Hi. - Hi. I'm just coming out to see what you're doing and maybe stop you. Oh, you know what? Do you have a siphon? I think I'm gonna run out of gas. Why do you need more gas? Well, I'm Writing a message. Is it a good message or a bad message? I'm asking Holly a question in fire. Are you proposing? Maybe. [Gasps] - Oh! - Wow. You know what? I've got gas on my hands and my shoes. Would you would you light it? Do the honors, please? Yeah. Yeah, no problem. - Pam? - Yep? Could you light this, please? Michael, you've had two ideas today And one of them was great, and the other one was terrible. I am not in the mood for riddles, Pam. This is terrible. No, this is romantic. You know what? I'm gonna get a hose, and then we'll talk about it. Okay? We'll figure it out. I'll be right back. Just stay there. Free sample? My mom makes the best Pesto in the world. And I always tell her, "mom, you should sell this. You'd make a fortune." And she always says, "no, it's just for family." Well, finally, I was like, "fuck it, I'll sell it." So I'm like, "mom, I need you to make a ton of Pesto for a Pesto party for all my friends." She's like, "uh, okay." Pesto party? Really? Anyway, she makes, like, It's so good. And Phyllis just had that "mom" look I wanted. You got this kosher certified? No, I meant like, "it's cool. It's kosher. It's all good." Ryan, you have such an interesting mind. So creative. All these new business ideas and artistic projects. [Chuckles] Thank you. What you got there? Oh, it's just Stanley's old photo album. I was thinking about throwing it in the garbage. I mean, why would I want some random black man's old photo album sitting on my bookshelf? I'm not James Franco. Things are going very well. I traded a thumbtack for Meredith's junk, for Kelly's crap, for Phyllis's garbage, for Oscar's trash, for Stanley's crap, for Ryan's junk, for creed's garbage, for a very cute squid that Erin happened to have. Jim, put those away. I'm really sorry. Pam must have put those out. All right, just out of curiosity, what were the claims for those beans? They're legumes, Dwight. And you're just gonna make fun of me, so why would I? [Scoffs] You know what? This ends now. Hey, Michael. Everyone's in the conference room. Why? You called the meeting. I don't I did? Okay. Thank you all for coming. I would like to talk to you today about Recycling. - Michael? - Yes. We are a family. I could not agree with you more. And I've always believed that we should all be very involved in one another's personal lives in a very major way. - Yes, thank you. - So about this proposal thing. No, no, no, no, no. My mind's made up. I am not going to change my mind. You can't talk me out of it. Michael, she's perfect for you. - She's the one. - She's amazing. This is very exciting. [Chuckles] So we just we want to help you plan the proposal so that it's safe and responsible and realistic and doable. I had a great idea until you ruined it. You want to know how to do it? Here's how you do it. Take her out to dinner, go down on one knee. If you are in costume, you did something wrong. If at any point you find yourself tying the ring to a dog's collar, stop and look at yourself. Hmm. [Speaks in texan accent] I'm gon' play me a little old blackmail card Nice. And call a proxy meeting and take control and take control of ewing oil once and for all. No, you can't do that. You can't play a blackmail card and call a proxy meeting in the same turn. Why not? Seems to me we're just making up rules 'cause somebody forgot to staple the rule book to the inside of the game like a normal human being. And I'm gonna play this here "share the wealth" card. Ooh! Which entitles me to half of both of you all's money. So if you don't mind no, this card is from the wrong game. This is from the game of life. It was in the box. - Well played. - Thank you. We must honorably adhere to the rules that we are making up on the spot. No, but that's not fair. Well, that's Dallas. Dallas, indeed. What? Ryan, where did you get this picture? My mom also makes the best salsa. This is your mom's old stuff? Yeah, mostly. How's she doing? It didn't go down easy, but she's made some friends, and it's already better than it was. How do you know when it's time? I don't know if you ever know. And if you wait for the day when your parent comes to you and says, "I can't take care of myself," it's never gonna happen. I have a box of bras under the table if you're interested. Let me see. Okay, I think animals in proposals are out. Right, Ryan? Didn't you read in one of your blogs that animals are out? Blogs are out, but people are texting each other, "no more animals," yeah. How about this? I throw a corpse dressed like me off of the roof. It hits the ground, the head pops off. This leads to me saying the line, "I lost my head when I fell in love with you." That's a guarantee. Easy enough to get a corpse. You just go to a med school. I already have the ring. Don't think you need the corpse then. There's the ring. Holy [Bleep]! Is that real? Yeah. They say, "three years' salary." No. Is she not gonna like that? No, she's gonna love it. So I think you can keep the proposal simple. You know, like when Jim proposed, he just he got down on one knee, and he told me that he loved me and he asked me to marry him. And it was perfect. Where was that? At a gas station. [Laughter] A gas station? Well, it was when she was working in New York, so it was halfway between both of us. That must have been a surprise, when, at the gas station, you proposed. No, it was really it was really sweet. It was raining and oh, yeah. You didn't say that the weather was bad. That sounds perfect. I want this to be an event that everyone talks about always and forever. Totally reasonable. I'm just it's terrifying. She's not gonna say no. I know, but I'm still scared. I don't know why. 'Cause it's a big deal. I mean, I knew Pam was gonna say yes, but I was still scared. You were scared? Yeah. It's scary. Get this. Kevin thought I was gonna sell my Bowflex for $200, and I told him, "dude, this was a prop in my movie." Look, I need to talk to you. Okay, it's because we haven't sold anything. You know what? We just wait till the end of the day. People get desperate, and they're gonna pay anything. I think I need to go home to Colorado. My dad isn't doing so well. Oh, okay. For how long? I don't know. - Is he all right? - Yeah. - You okay? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. I just you know, I just don't want to go home when he's on his deathbed, you know? I want to be there when he's still my dad. Yeah, yeah. Well, you definitely need to do that. And I want you to come with me. Now, I I know that's a lot to ask of a boyfriend. Okay. And I was thinking, you know, maybe, since given our last conversation, and that we're both ready Michael Scott, will you no, no. Shh! Shu shut it. [Chuckles] Oh, God. Nope, nope, nope. UhWhat? No, I am not going to be proposed to in the break room. That is not going to be our story. Mm-mmm. Should have burned this place down when I had the chance. Hey, guys! It's mu turn. You can't go. You're dead. I shot you five moves ago. Yeah, I told you you can't shoot people. I told you we're way past rules. We have been for some time now. Start having rules now, everything we've built collapses. Well, this is stupid, and I want my money back. Where's the money? Yeah, where is it? Okay, you know what? I am never ever playing games with you two again. And that is Dallas. - Nice. - Not bad, right? I can't really tell. Nice. I know, right? What the oh, my God. That that's impossible. It is, right? I mean, it's impossible. [Sighs] All right, I'll take 'em. - They're probably worthless. - Probably. Leave the telescope. I started with a thumbtack and traded my way to a telescope. But in a way, the most valuable thing here wasn't the telescope at all. No. It was this packet of beans, so I traded the telescope for it. And I can I can just go buy another telescope. Hey. How'd we do? $13. That's great. And we still have most of our stuff. Good. Listen, about earlier no, no, no, no, no. Let's not talk about that. I was wrong to put you in that position. I Michael, you're my life now. I'm not going to Colorado. Shh. You know what? Let's go for a little walk. I want to show you some stuff. So this is one of my favorite places in the world. Why? This is where Toby announced that he was going to Costa Rica. It was the happiest day of my life Until the day you came to replace him. Let's go in here. And this is where we first kissed. I remember. And this is where we first made love. Remember what I tried there? [Whispers] Michael! [Chuckles] Through these blinds is where I first saw you. And you had all these boxes, and I thought you were the prettiest mover I had ever seen. And I was sitting at this desk When I called you to tell you that I had herpes, and that I was still in love with you. And you said that it was over and that you didn't love me. And thank goodness none of that was true, including the herpes. It was an ingrown hair. Yes. Right in here. This is where we co-ran our first meeting. Remember? Obesity awareness? - Mm-hmm. Saved a lot of lives that day. That's where you first met Michael Klump. Oh, I say I say I sit on you. [Laughter] And right over there, that's where you realized that Meredith was prostituting herself for outback steak. And I will never forget that you had the cutest look on your face because you couldn't believe it. You thought it was so wrong. And over here what happened here? Well, nothing. Nothing really. I would just find an excuse to come here So I could stare at you through that window. This is what I'd do. [Chuckles] Nice. Let's go in here. Here? Hi, guys. This is where our love faces its toughest test. After this, just smooth sailing for the rest of our lives. Holly, will you marry me? No. Marry me, Holly. No. That guy's got more than he can handle as it is. Will you marry me? No. That marriage would be a sham. - Will you marry me? - No. Easy no. - Will you marry me? - No. That would be hot. I would pay to see that. - Will you marry me, Holly? - No. Only one that I was kind of worried about. This is where I fell in love with you And this is where I ask you to marry me. It started with a broken [fire alarm beeping] [Gasps] [Both laughing] - Aah! - Yeah. [Gasps] [Imitating yoda] Holly flax Marrying me will you be? [Imitating yoda] Your wife becoming Be will I. [Laughter] [Cheering] That is so awesome. - Congratulations! - Congratulations! Thank you! Thank you. So, guys, guys, guys, guys We're moving to Colorado. All of us? - Yep. - Wait. What? Holly has to go back to Colorado. I'm going with her. I'm leaving. - A sombrero, please? - All right. - So just you tonight? - Actually, I am meeting somebody, but I'm a little bit early. Leaving my company. After 19 years. I'll drink to that! - I'm starting at a company this week. - Oh, really? To beginnings and endings. And to middles, the unsung heroes. And to moms. To moms of the troops. Do not tell my fiancee I'm drinking on a Wednesday. I won't. I don't know her. Moving out to the 'burbs. Actually, I'm moving further than the 'burbs. I'm moving to Colorado. - Colorado? - Yeah. - Sunshine state. - Yep. Don't mess with Colorado. No, don't. Doing some skiing? No, no, I don't want to end up like Sonny Bobo. Well, that's just that's just good sense right there. Yeah, everyone I know who skis is dead. You know what, I would like to try the luge though. Try it once, you're hooked. That's my guess. That's what I've heard. - I'm an Olympics nut. - Oh, yeah? Me too. Summer or winter? Summer. Knuckle. Actually, I gotta come around to give you yeah, come on. You know, it's funny. I actually tried to get an animal Olympics going. Really? What happened? You know, life happened. What are you gonna miss most about Scranton? Oh, wow. The mountains, where things are. That's the way it goes. Man, he is late. I'm gonna call him. Do you mind? I'm sorry. No, no, no. Where is this guy? Excuse me. I need to take this. Hello? - This is Michael Scott. - Yes, yes. You running late? I'm here. - No, I'm here. - Oh. - I'm at the bar. - I'm at the bar too. - You are? - Uh-huh. What bar? I'm at the the bar the bar that's located in the lobby of the hotel. I do not see you. How long have you I've been here about, gosh, over half an hour. Okay, yeah, me too. Sorry. Sorry. What are you wearing? I am wearing a gray suit, red tie. Are we both at the right place? Which place? - I hear your voice. - I hear your - I hear your voice - I see your lips moving. - In the phone. - And, oh, brother. And that's man! Michael Scott. D'Angelo Vickers. - Wow. - Ah. That is insane! "That is insane" is right. That's the right term. Bartender, let's get some vodka up in this cranberry, and one for my friend. There we go. Ready? - I am ready. - All right, here we go. Well, this is it. What do you think? She'll do. Oh, she'll do just fine. I am very much looking forward to tomorrow. Uh, it is, uh it feels like the culmination of a lot of hard work, a lot of good fortune, and, uh Hey, come on. Did that did that just happen? We should write a movie or something. I'm serious. Michael is leaving, and apparently they already hired a new manager. And we're meeting him today. That's a lot to process, paperwork-wise. No, it's not Ashton Kutcher. It's Kevin Malone. Equally handsome, equally smart. Okay, everyone, as you know, one of my favorite things is fanfare for its own sake. So without further ado, let's all start clapping. Presenting D'Angelo Vickers! Hi! Hello. - Come on out! - Oh. Hello. Hey. How are you, sir? I'm well, sir. How are you? Uh, can I just say, I am so excited to be working here. A little bit about myself I love the American southwest, for starters. You may call them Arizona, new Mexico, Nevada, Utah. I call them heaven. I have a peanut allergy. Something I live with. It's a part of me. I've learned to cope with it. What else I'm just as comfortable at a ball game as I am at the opera. I was a did I want to be made manager? Sure. A great opportunity squandered? Absolutely. A crushing blow? Yes. Will I get over it? Mmm No. But life goes on. Not for me. I'll get that, guys. No, I'll help you. Here. You know, it's just you know? Oh, hi. Hello. Hi. Have we met before? No, not officially. I saw you coming out of the bathroom earlier. Well, I guess I'm gonna go back to my cave. Okay. It was really great meeting you. And that Is what they call a "meet cute." So we talked for, like, 20 minutes. No clue it's D'Angelo the whole time. That's kind of embarrassing. No, no. Yeah, that story makes you sound stupid. I happen to like the hilarious hijinks that I get myself into. There he is there D'Angelo, I was just telling them about last night when we met. - Oh. - Remember that? That was crazy. That was great. "Uh, let's see. Where's my replacement?" "Where's the guy I'm replacing?" I don't know. Why don't I look to my left? - I know. - You're sitting right there. I know. Well, that's that's what I was just saying. That's the that exact situation is why I always carry around a couple of these. Just in case, 'cause, you know, sometimes you need to I.D. Yourself. Office funny guy. Always glad to have an office funny guy around. I wasn't even trying to make a joke. But I guess I've always been sort of quirky. Offbeat. A little twisted. This is Jim and Pam, aka "Jap." What started as an affair has blossomed into a family before our eyes. Well, it was it wasn't an affair. - Yes, it was. - But, no but we are a family. We made that. - Cecilia. - Aw. - Congratulations. - Thank you. I have four kids of my own. - Really? - Yeah. Oh, my gosh. Well, we just have the one, but she poops for four. Uh-oh, someone started off on a good foot with the new boss. Yeah, they don't ever talk about careers that were made because of unplanned pregnancies, so. Psst. Thanks for meeting me. Are you kidding? I would come anywhere to see a turtle. - Yeah. - Where'd you find him? There's no turtle, Michael. I just wanted to get you here. You know me very well, Dwight. - That's because I'm your right-hand man, Michael. But I can't do it. I can't do it again. I can't be a right-hand man to a whole new guy. Now I'm gonna have to go online and look at turtles, or else I'm gonna be off the whole day. I want to be manager. I just don't understand why I wasn't even interviewed for the job. You know, what's wrong? I'm totally qualified. You were pushing for me. That apple looks delish. I do a lot of portion control. Try to keep my daily caloric intake under 1,200. D'Angelo, you're going to starve to death. So you decided to have an orgy and not invite me? Come on! I call middle. It's cool that you like the southwest. It's one of my favorite regions. "It's one of my favorite regions." Did I just sound totally lame? No. I sounded good. I love the desert. It's one of my favorite ecosystems. Here's the great thing about the southwest. There is so much more than desert. Along the north rim of the grand canyon is a forest as lush as you've ever seen. Burned. It's lush, dummy. Hey, uh, D'Angelo. What do you think about bald people? I hate them. D'Angelo, I forget, did you mention you liked politics? - I did not. - Because I was thinking, you should meet my boyfriend. He's a state senator. I really think the two of you would hit it off. He's a great person to know. Sounds very interesting. Thank you. Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin. Okay, let me transfer you. Why do you use your name when you answer the phone? Oh, that's how Pam does it. I just copy her. She's she's sort of a living legend. Try it without using your name. Dunder Mifflin, this is. Oh, yeah. I like it. Dunder Mifflin, how may I assist you? Oh, assist. I sort of like the old way. I just prefer it without the name. I thought Okay, no, no, no. I gotta start doing some managing at some point, right? I know, I know. I'm sorry. But if it's not a big deal, we should just do the old way. - And it really isn't. - Okay. That good? Yeah, okay, good. Well, I'd like to change it, actually. Well, you know, whatever. - Yeah. - Whatever you think would work. What do you think? I think a change would be nice. You could do the old way, or the, you know, whichever one you want to do. Change it. I'm so sorry. Sorry. Hey, funny guy. I'm having a little mid-day lull here. Make me laugh. Huh? What do you got? - Uh - I can't even look at you. Here we go. Okay. - Okay, what do, um, African-Americans call the - What? - Um. - D'Angelo. - Yeah? Did you order a barber? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Come on back here. Put a pin on that. I can't I can't wait to hear the punch line. Finish the joke, Andy. What do African-Americans call? I don't know. Help me. - That is so bad-ass. Just so hardcore. Yeah, very cool. Real power move. Yeah. Saw a hawk today. Just sitting right there on the overpass, looking at me. Shave me. Well, this is going to be funny, because it looks like we're gonna be shaving buddies. Okay, all right. I love it. - Ha, ha, ha, ha! - I love it. Michael, this is Reggie. Hello. - He's the number-one yelp-reviewed shaver in Scranton. It's not even close. And this is Erin, and she's going to shave my face. Here we go. All right. This is how we do it. - Mmm. - Feels nice, doesn't it? It really does. This is luxury. Here we go. Okay. Oh, that is nice. You wanted to talk to us, D'Angelo? Oh, yes, yes. Please cozy up there. I just thought we could have some rap sessions with smaller groups. You know, we don't really do rap sessions. We kind of do God! We sort of do more of like pow-wows or whatevs. - Okay, well, pow-wows then, fine. That's Hey, D'Angelo, my mom just sent me this picture of Cece. It is so adorable. - All right, wait, but a little bit of back-story. She loves dogs. She calls them "da-das." - Da-das. - And what happens is you know what? Enough about your baby, okay? Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, we were just I think she was just trying to no, no, no. I know what you're doing. Just quit it. I want to hear from the rank and file. How can I be the best manager for you all? You know, what can I do better? Okay, you know what, everybody? There's you have to be honest here. You you can't say that everything is perfect, right? So, you know, come up with something. Well, D'Angelo, I'd say communication could be improved. People stopped reading memos, so everyone marks them "urgent." Okay, you know what, I mark it urgent "a," urgent "b," urgent "c," urgent "d." Urgent "a" is the most important. Urgent "d" you don't even really have to worry about. Okay, um, Michael, can you stop talking now? I have to do your lips. Don't shave my lips. What's up? I don't mean to go off on a rant here, but I wrote the perfect joke. Topical, edgy. Funny. I saw this thing in the news. Democrats want electric cars. Republicans don't. Right. I'm thinkin' how crazy is it that we got a car debate goin' on in a city known for gridlock? UmLet's not talk politics in the office, okay? I like you better as the funny guy. I wasn't taking a a position. It was just sort of one of those things. Now, that's funny. That's funny. You walk much? Yeah! Right? I meanAh! - Little click. - Mm-hmm. D'Angelo, this box came for you. Great! Thank you. That's my stuff. - Oh! - Yeah. Michael, take a look at this. - Need a hand? - Oh, that'd be great. Thank you. Hey, you know what? This office sort of has a perfect fung shooey to it, andYou know, let's not go overboard with the redecorating. I'm still here, so Wow! - Right? - Nice. I still have to look at this stuff, guys, so - So this is a ten-gallon hat? - Yeah, you like that? Ten-gallon hat. Technically, it only holds about three quarts. Little factoid. Interesting. D'Angelo's great. I love the guy. But I'm not sure he's a good fit for the office. And also, I'm not sure if I love the guy. All right, see you later, girl. Hey, hey, hey. Naw, I'm good. Keep that. Hey, funny man. What you got for me? Make me laugh. Let's see Let's see if my favorite tea is in here Oh, jeez! That's hot coffee! Drink some soap. Drink some hand soap. I guess this is my life now. How do I become a manager at sabre? Well, first things first. Thank you for coming to me directly, you know? I know you could have called Tallahassee, but they would have just looped back to me, so It's cool you recognize my role here. I left a message at corporate. UhThere you go. Get a recommendation from Michael. That'll put you right on the short list for next time there's an opening. Can't you just use the recommendation you already have on file? What recommendation? From when he recommended me to replace him. I'm so I'm sorry, I never know how to act in these awkward-type situations. Best whale watching. Easily the west coast. If you're gonna go whale watching on the east coast, you might wanna bring a magazine called west coast whales. 'Cause you're not gonna see 'em. Snack time. It's the witching hour. It is the sandwiching hour. - Awesome. - Mmm. What ya got? Pb and j. My mom's recipe. Michael, D'Angelo has a peanut allergy. Okay, I need a wide berth. I need a wide berth from those nuts. What are you doing? Have you lost your mind? I think Kevin wants one. Kevin here ya go! Oh! Michael, this is serious. Do you know what happens if D'Angelo touches a peanut? - What? - Michael, the last time I was exposed to a peanut, I was itchy for three days, okay? Had to take baths constantly. I missed the oj verdict. Had to read about it in the paper like an idiot! Wait. So you don't go into like shock or die or anything. No, Jim. Not everything's life and death. I wanna feel comfortable. Oscar, here you go. You're getting nut particles all in the air! No one had a problem with the air here until you came around. Everyone, mandatory meeting. Multipurpose room, now. No, that's good. You just stay in there. Stay in there by yourself, loser. Nobody go in. What? - Nobody go in there. - What? - Stay where you are. - Michael, this is insane. No, it's not insane, Oscar. I've been here for 19 years, and just because someone else is called the boss, you're gonna throw it all away? N-no. Listen, you're the one who decided to leave. Come on. He's our new boss. You know we have to do this. Ooh, well. Who needs 'em? Looks like it's just you and me, Dwight. Correction. Just you. All right. Meeting, multifunction room. Hey, Michael. Michael, wait up. Hold up, hold up. So so for these meetings, do you just do you just jump into business, or do you start with some chitchat or I start with some chitchat and maybe a couple of jokes. And you might wanna develop a couple of characters. Go on, you just you'll be fine. Maybe. Maybe not. - No. - You know, it is too bad for this place that you're leaving. Bring it in. Come on. Bring okay. Okay. Why did you have to be so damn good? I I'm adequate. I-I'm half as good as you. - No, no, no. - Oh, come on. You are good. They know it. Come on. I just didn't expect you to get there so fast. Would you do me a favor and enjoy this time, okay? You've worked so hard. Get your senioritis on. It's lake Havasu time. Guess I been working so hard, I Forgot what it's like to be hardly working. Okay. What is the Native American girl's name? You'll figure it out. Thank you, Dwight. - Um - Listen up! Hey, D'Angelo. Want to meet Cece? That's a cute baby. Very cute baby. Adorable, very cute. Thank you very much. See? We knew it. If he just met her - he'd understand. - We're back in. Right? I'm telling you, that baby could be the star of a show called "babies I don't care about". It is 6 AM, and Deangelo and I are about to go house to house to give everybody their Dundies nomination certificate just like the oscars. Yes. And this happens every year? Every year this happens. You have a lot to learn, my friend. Well, you know, why don't we try it, and if it goes good, it'll be part of my tradition. Why are you even saying that? You're gonna love it. Here we go. This one. This way. Nice house. - Surprise! - Congratulations! Yep. You and Pam have both been nominated for Dundie awards. Okay. - Rawr! - There we go! Have Pam come out. No, no, she's not here. What's going on? Stay in bed. - Congratulations. - Stanley, we love you. Have you lost your mind? Get off my property before I call the police. All right, we got it. Good. - Leave it at the door? - Yeah, that's fine. Okay. Hey, Toby, you suck! Is this an employee of ours? Go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Gosh, I've never seen this place in the daylight. This reminds me of Katrina. Here we go. All right. You got it? Are we set? Hello? I'm so busted. Walk of shame. Do you usually leave your door unlocked and ajar? Nice! I got a Dundie nomination. - Yes, you did. - Yes, that's right. No big deal. Congratulations, Meredith. All right, well, we should head out. No, no, no, you gotta stay. No, no, no, I have vienna sausages and I have napkins. Let me fix you breakfast. I'm not going in there. Go. Good morning, Erin. Oh, hey, didn't see you. Any big plans for tonight? I don't know. Maybe volunteer at the women's shelter, go to bed. Or, I don't know, maybe I'm going to the Dundies! You are getting so funny. Very good. The Dundies are my baby, and they need to go on. When Larry king died, they didn't just cancel his show. They got piers Morgan to come in and do his show, and that way Larry lives on. Anything can happen at the Dundies. They're like the golden globes but less mean. And I just want us to all have a good time. Just a little announcement, folks. Remember, the Dundies is a black tie affair. Black tie optional. Every day is black tie optional. Fyi, tonight we will be hosting at Louie Volpe's. - Nice. - I love their breadsticks. Oh, their breadsticks are like crack. I love when people say "like crack" who have obviously never done crack. Well, their breadsticks are like what then, Ryan? What can I use? I don't know, something from your world. "The breadsticks are like scrapbooking." You're right. No, I'm a middle class fraud. Shh, okay, okay, okay. Everybody's right. They're like breadsticks on steroids. Right? Yeah, that's great. So as you know, the Dundies are my legacy. So I'm going to need to train a replacement. So this year I have decided to have a co-host. And that person is Deangelo. Always the Padawan, never the Jedi. Thank you, Michael, but I will have to pass. Think of it as part of your training. I'm not much of a performer, unless you count singing in the shower. Boy, okay. Okay, well, we'll work on it. Look, I'm very, very bad. Very bad. You're doing it. Guys, I want you to help us work on some banter. Yes, I love banter. But I hate witty banter. Here we go. So, Deangelo, you and I have a lot in common. You lost 200 pounds, and I lose my car keys every morning. That is true. We do share some similarities. I know how you can fix one of those problems. For me, it was portion control. For you, you need a key chain. Maybe hang it on the-- Okay, okay, you know what, I didn't actually lose my keys. - So this did not happen? - Mm-kay. There needs to be what you call a rat-a-tat. And right now it's all rat and no tat. Ryan, come on up here. Deangelo, if you would just-- Tap Deangelo out. - If I can see it-- - Just watch us. Okay, Ryan, how are you today? Why don't you ask my therapist? My mom certainly pays her enough. There you go! Lovely. Regis and Kelly. Nice. Use that as an inspiration. - Okay. - Just be funny. Uh, you sir, are we having fun tonight? - Having a great time. - Oh, good, good. Where were you on September 11th? No, gosh. No, no, stop, stop. What? This is so weird. If I'm conducting a meeting, good to go. But if I think of it as a performance, I fall apart obviously. Why don't you think of hosting the Dundies like you're just running a meeting? No, no, no. This is the performance of your life. Why don't you just privately in your own head think of it like a meeting? Jim, please, no loopholes. Mike, why do you have to control how he perceives it in his mind? This is my last Dundies ever. If I want mind control over him, is that too much to ask? Me, mo, me, mo. Good. Good. Good. Good. Now tell me something terrible that happened in your childhood. When I was very young, my mother divorced my father and I had to go to court to choose between them. Too personal. I don't wanna hear about that stuff. Let's try this, put this on. I am going to turn this on. And turn the volume all the way up so you can't-- That's right! You're not going to be able to hear yourself. Read this and it's going to sound perfect. "The Dundies are com-- "All about coming together! "And recognizing the indomitability of the human spirit!" Say it with an accent. - "The Dundies--" - The Dundies! - The Dundies! I just don't understand the desire to push sweet potato fries on me. I just want regular fries. Yeah. Hey, Erin, everything okay? Get away from the car. He's gonna see you. Who's gonna see us? Just get in, get in. Just get in. Get in the car? Please! Sorry. Get in. Sorry, sorry, sorry. What's wrong? I eat lunch in the car now. It's my alone time. It's just nice to have some time away from Gabe. Why don't you want to eat lunch with your boyfriend? I really don't like spending time with him. Don't you think it's better to tell him the truth now, you know, rather than waste more of his time? - I think I'm gonna go. - What? - I think you got this. - Okay. - Okay? - Yeah. - All right? - Okay. - Feel better. - Thank you, Jim. I'm sorry, that just wasn't interesting to me. I can't just dump him, Pam. I'm not like you. I can't be mean. - Wait, when am I-- You just have to be clear and firm. You know, just tell him you don't love him. Just be honest with him. - Hi. - Appalling. Eyesore. Surprisingly adequate. Okay, everyone, the festivities commence in four seconds. Deangelo, Jo's on the phone for you. Hello? Deangelo, we're in serious horse manure here. The Dundies are tonight, and we ain't got no host. Oh, no! Luckily, I have someone for you. - Billy crystal? - Better. Neil Patrick Harris? He's in little shop of horrors on Broadway. No, we need Michael Scott, the best darn Dundies host both sides of the Mississippi. I gotta find Michael Scott. Hmm, and then I gotta Get him to the Dundies! Hey, can you help me find Michael Scott, Angela? My boyfriend can. He's a state senator. - Mm-hmm. - Oh, no, he can't help, because that title has no meaning. Try Jim, Deangelo. He'll be able to help. Jim, do you know where I can find Michael Scott? Oh, I totally don't know where Michael is, dude. Hey, you want to listen to some records? No one's listening to me! I'm running out of time. What-- What are you talking about? I've fallen and I can't get up. Maybe I just need to look into my heart. Deangelo, where is Michael Scott? I'm here. In a good way. I've been here the whole time. The analytical part of me wants to examine it. But I know it has no content. Ladies and gentlemen, please stand up for your co-host of the evening, Michael Gary Scott. Please remain standing for your other co-host and new manager, Deangelo Jeremetrius Vickers! Is that part of the-- Hey. Deangelo, what are you doing? There's a live audience out there. Just go do it by yourself, or get Ryan. No, Ryan would never do it. It's too on the radar. Look, look. The boss hosts the Dundies. It's sort of our perk. This was not part of the job description. Okay, listen to me. You're not doing this for me. You're not doing this for you. You're not even doing this for them. What am I doing it for? You're doing it for all those kids out there eating off the Louie Volpe's kids' menu, who are wondering, "does it get better?" What I want you to do is I want you to say "it's showtime." Get out there. I can't. - Say it. - Stop hitting me. You can do it. Just say it. Hit me again. Now hit me. One, two, three. It's showtime. All right, here we go. Okay, okay, sorry about the delay, everybody. But we were at the DMV waiting in line. Fall asleep right after sex, huh, guys? Nope. Go back to the script. There are a lot of great salesmen in this office. But one of our great salesmen is also a great dad, and a close personal friend of mine. Jim Halpert, best dad Dundie! Wow, I do not parent for the awards, but I gotta tell you, it feels pretty good. Um, Cece, if you're watching this at home, it's way past your bedtime. By the way, how did this get televised? Thanks. - Well done. - I don't know. Maybe being a good dad is just following your own compass. I don't know. I don't know. Thank you. Didn't think to mention me, huh? Didn't I? Which moves us to best mom Dundie. This person, well, I guess we all sort of consider a mom around the office-- Meredith Palmer! I'll tell you one thing, I'm not gonna be a good mom tonight. Excuse me. Can I get a photo of the best mom and the best dad, please? Step on up. Well, I gotta go do this. Why? Big smiles, folks. There they are. Year after year, I catch a lot of flak on this particular award, because year after year, I present this award to a guy instead of a girl. Hottest in the office goes to Danny Cordray! How do I feel about not winning hottest in the office this year? Um, I'm very relieved. How do you-- How do you judge something like that? What is his criteria even? It's-- It's so subjective. Stanley Hudson is a grump. Everybody knows that. But did you know that Stanley Hudson is also the face of a debilitating disease known as diabetes. The diabetes award goes to Stanley Hudson! Come on up here, you sick bastard. We're proud of you. I have diabetes too, but you don't see me making a big deal about it. They say he's going to be my right-hand man. Ad lib masturbation joke. Nope. I hate this. I hate it so much. Dwight Shrute, please accept this promising assistant manager Dundie. Thank you. Thanks so much. Um, I want to dedicate this award to something that, uh, we take for granted in our daily lives. And that is the humble trash can. This is for you, trash can! Who gave you those crayons? I brought them from home. Do you have a red? This is a cloth tablecloth. You can't color on it. Oh, really? Did you know herpes affects one out of every five sexually active adults? Pippi Longstocking. Ronald McDonald's wife. Ron Howard. Ron Weasley. What do they all have in common? Redheads. Erin Hannon Come on up here to receive your cutest redhead in the office award! This is bull! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! This is the first award I've ever won in my entire life. People were right about the Dundies. They are magical. But I don't feel it, and I think that's because I'm not with the right person. Gabe - What? - We should break up. What? I'm not attracted to you. I just--I cringe when you talk. I have to be honest. Right? Right, Pam? Thank you for hearing me. Okay, well, this is embarrassing. Um, I'm obviously really angry at Erin. Here comes that quarter-life crisis everyone's talking about. All right, I'm gonna-- I'm gonna go. Let's-- There you go. Damn, that was cold. It is difficult to recognize the person who will be replacing you. But he is a good guy. So the Michael Scott award for best Dundies host goes to Deangelo Vickers. Speech, speech, speech, speech! Hold on. Hold on one second. Okay. Crank it. I want to--I want-- I feel truly blessed, uh, to be working with all of you. You know, before this all started, uh, funny story, I was in the bathroom vomiting and vomiting. The men's room. That's why it's been shut down for most of the evening. That's it! This is important. He's expressing himself. - No. - Hosts don't get Dundies. This-- This is truly special for me And, uh, anyway, it's so much lighter! - We're done. - That's it. - Michael, are we-- What? - We're done. We're done. My last Dundies ever. I was hoping it would be more like Godfather III. That wrapped up the whole franchise in an extremely satisfying way. But instead, it is Godfather I. That was very confusing, had maybe three big laughs Oh, well. Hey, Michael. We were thinking maybe we could keep this thing going. What? I know I'm the cause of this royal screw-up, but I would like to see the show go on. No, don't. You're being too hard on yourself. We had a very truncated rehearsal time. Let's grab some ice cream, go back to the office, and finish what we started. - Yeah. - Mm-hmm. So what you're saying is you kinda liked it. I've fallen and I can't get up! The Phyllis bit, that was pretty good, right? - I don't know that we need to dissect it all right now-- - But that got a big laugh. - It did. That actually got a big laugh. We were laughing, right? I was. Oh, you know what, I have to go to the bathroom. We're really close. You know, I can just run over to the gas station there. We should just wait here and not get good seats in the conference room? That's true, we wouldn't get seats together. Okay, yeah. I'll hold it. I'm fine. You know, despite a couple hiccups, I thought that went very well. I thought it was the worst Dundies I've ever been to. Man. Maybe you should have won the kind of a bitch award. Oh, gladly, I'd accept that award, because a bitch is a female dog. Okay. What? What are you doing? Please don't stop so suddenly. Seatbelt's pressing on my bladder. Why are you even wearing a seatbelt? You're sitting in the back seat, baby. What is your problem? I just don't see the point to the Dundies, okay? The jokes were terrible, the venue was bad, the fashion was boring-- Okay, that-- That is unfair. The clothing was safe but tasteful. And next time, why don't you pick a co-host that doesn't have microphone-aphobia. Look, whatever you're going to do, how long is it gonna take? Ballpark? 'Cause I just-- I've gotta make a decision here. He-- He is in an all-out sprint. Please, excuse me. Here, okay. By his own admission, this person actually tried marijuana in college, so the doobie-doobie pothead stoner of the year award goes to Andy Bernard! There's a lot of people I'd like to thank. But I think we all actually want to thank you, Michael. Oh, thank you. I mean, we actually really all want to thank you for everything. Oh, my God, something's happening.  we actually sat down and did the math  that's how many minutes that you've worked here  email forwards you made us read  that's like watchidie hard  I forgive you for kissing me  oh, you got to remember to call  love is a gift from up above  yeah yeah you got to remember to call yeah, okay. Well, this is gonna hurt like a mother. Suffer from extreme repulsiveness. Someone in our midst is bringing that problem to light. Toby Flenderson, please come up here and accept the extreme repulsiveness award. Oh, that's so mean. No, it's fine. It's his last Dundies. You gotta play along, man. Come on, Toby. Here he comes! All right. You deserved it. I really disagree with this. I think it's kind of hateful. Although I am a little happy right now to have a platform to talk about the outcome of a case that I was recently a juror on, The Scranton strangler. A man's being put to death. I was part of the verdict, and I'm not so sure he's guilty anymore. Well, I'm moving to Colorado to start my new life with Holly. Just up here getting used to the altitude. - Michael? - Yes? I've got a treat for you. Thank you. Like a butler. Colorado specialty-- Rocky Mountain oysters. Wow, those do not taste like oysters. That's because they're not oysters. They're bull testicles! I cut them off fresh this morning! Sick freak. What is wrong with you? What is wrong with you. I'm the sick freak? After what you did, you expect to be buttled? After you didn't recommend me? Dwight, I don't own Dunder Mifflin, okay? The job was not mine to give. Look, I need your advice on something. I am told that there are bears in the rockies. Where did you hear that? Obvious XM radio? Well, I was just thinking that maybe I should keep a salami in my pocket Great idea. In order to feed the bears. Especially if you think that life would be better without legs! How do you mean? Black bears can smell a salami at five Miles, Michael. What are you thinking? And they run faster than a horse. So if you were thinking about outrunning them on a horse, I would try a cheetah. You in tight pants, Michael, are a salami to a black bear. - Do you understand? - Mm-hmm. You're like a giant walking salami. Okay, so no salami in the pants. How about a pepperoni? Any kind of meat you can possibly name. Okay. You're not gonna take all your toys, are you? I mean, you don't-- You don't have a job lined up, so It's not like you have a desk to put 'em on. Well, I have interviews. That's nice. What about that truck? Can I have this little truck? Was thinking thinking I might glue a stapler on top or put a hole here and stick pens in it. You okay? Yes. Yes, you know what, take my favorite truck, sure. You know what, uh It's your last couple of days. I'm gonna get out of your hair. Oh, you don't-- I will be in the break room. Okay, that sounds good. Thank you. Dead man walking. Sad? No. No, no. I don't leave till tomorrow, so tomorrow I will be a wreck. - Stay away from Erin. - Hey. I'm your boss. Why don't you, uh, stay away from me? No, I'm gonna stand where I want, okay? You don't want to get on my bad side. I've seen some horrible things. I own over 200 horror movies. Okay, that's so weird! Just go away! No, you go away. Hi, Jim. You guys are filming people when they go to the bathroom now? How about cupcakes? Please. - What's wrong with cupcakes? - Everything. There they are. The party planning committee together again. Well, we all wanted to plan your good-bye party. We thought this would be easier. We thought. It's an experiment. The three of us have all been chairmen before. So this is the dream team. Hey! What are you saying? The dream team and Meredith. We decided on the ice cream. Mint chocolate chip-- Your favorite. Yeah, that was a surprise. You know what? I'm thinking maybe we should get ice cream that everybody will like. How about vanilla? Let's get vanilla. Okay. Tomorrow, I want everybody to have a good time. No drama. And as for today, just a typical day. All right? Should we get toppings? - What do you like, Pam? - What? What kind of topping would you like? Hot fudge? Sounds good. Fudge it up. I bought this for myself. And yesterday, they gave me this. I still need something to drink out of, though. Attention, everyone. Before I leave tomorrow, I would like to reveal a secret that I have kept for over 20 years. Secret about Phyllis. Please, Michael. When Phyllis was in high school, she was so cute. And she still is. I thought he knew about the baby I gave away. Look, Michael, it's a going-away present so your hands won't get cold. It's almost done, but you can't get them wet, and they can't be dry-cleaned either. You have to hand wash without water, wring dry gently, and use a hair dryer on cool. Sounds great. I just think it's great. Oh, I have gifts as well. And I will start by giving the first gift to Phyllis. Phyllis, you are shy and sweet, and you don't often speak your mind, but you should, because you have great ideas. So, Phyllis, I am giving you this so you can always remember to speak your mind. Gee, thanks, Michael. - You're welcome. - It's cute. Stanley, you love your sudoku and your puzzles. I bestow upon you My felt. May you never lose the fun-loving quality in life. Where's the rest of it? It's got no balls. Well, okay. And Andy. Andy, who needs confidence that he is a great salesman, I give you my clients. Our ten most important accounts. - Wow. - Yeah, wow. You know I'm the worst salesman here, right? But you're the best salesman on the inside. What does that even mean? You sold us all on Andy-- A product that nobody wanted. I'm gonna lose 'em. You're not going to lose them. I promise you that I will. Just do your best. I have faith in you. Gimme those clients. No. Do you believe that? I've given up expecting Michael to do the right thing or the decent thing or even the comprehensible thing. I used to be obese. Once you've conquered obesity, everything else is easy. Life literally moves in slow motion. I'm not saying I'm superman, but let me just put it this way, if I were shot in the head, I'm pretty sure everything would be fine. I almost welcome it. Kevin, I have something for you. You know who that is? Don't be a caricature, Kevin. Never be a caricature. How did that feel when I tore that up? - Better? - Good. Stand up. You will be thin. You won't drool over pizza like an animal anymore. But, I-- You will find love. Michael, I'm pretty much okay with who I am now. Don't be. You should never settle for who you are. Oscar, Oscar, Oscar. Oscar, you are a-- Michael, I just lost Porter hardware! I just-- I lost 'em. Okay, you know what? Just do your best, buddy. Okay, Oscar, you are very smart, and you have a gigantic education, and I think of you as my scarecrow, because you gave me a brain. So that's why I made you this. Thank you, Michael. It's beautiful. It looks like It looks like it was made by a two-year-old monkey on a farm. And he just He just accepted it, that I That I put all this work into it. Oh, man. He-- He has the lowest opinion of me of anybody. Was it just me, or did you think we were gonna have sex at some point? It was just you. How would you have wanted to do it? I--don't. Okay, you know what? Inappropriate, because I am engaged happily, and you, you have landed yourself a senator. State senator. Mm-hmm. Bravo. - Brava. - Bra--? Do you want to see some pictures? I just got these. Sure. Um, these are-- Okay, um, this is us at the theater. Ohh! And, uh, antiquing. Oh, rollerblading. Rollerblading. Who's that? Who's that guy? Oh, that's Thomas, Robert's aide. I guess this could be the one, huh? Yeah. Yeah. - Hey. - Hey. Um, I'm gonna be dropping in on one of our biggest clients this afternoon, and I could use some backup. Let's rip it up, homes. All right. Boom. Walk away, bitch. - Oh, um, Michael. - Hmm? Uh, where do you want your last paycheck sent? Last paycheck? Do you have an address yet in Colorado? No. What town do Holly's parents live in? I'm not sure. Um, MountainTon, I think. Sounds beautiful. You should do more stuff like that. I'm going to. Hey. It's almost your last day. Come on. Sit with us. No, I'm almost done. - You sure? - Yeah. So I'm going to Carbondale this afternoon to get a new bulk shredder. Finally. That old shredder sucked. It's a good shredder. It just keeps breaking. Yeah, and it won't shred magazines. It's not supposed to shred magazines, Kevin. I know. Did you break the shredder, Kevin? No. It's just that old shredder sucks. Just get one that'll shred magazines. I don't think any of them are supposed to shred magazines. I can't-- I can't do this. All the channels are gonna be different there. I'm not gonna be able to find my shows. I'm not going to start improv at level one. I don't think my credits are gonna transfer. And you know what? I just figured out where I was supposed to go to vote. I gotta call her. And I'm going to tell her that I cannot come. Hello there. Hi. What is the name of our town? Boulder. Is something wrong? Are you okay? No. No, I just needed to hear your voice. Oh, you mean this? Yeah. Yes, my hero. I'll pay the rent. Okay, my mom's looking at me like she has no sense of humor. It's a joke. Oh, I miss you. Well, I'll see you tonight. I'll pick you up outside baggage claim. Okay, I'll see you tonight. I love you. I love you, too. Yeah, so I know I told everybody that tomorrow is my last day, but I'm-- I'm gonna be leaving tonight. I, uh, head to the airport at 4:00. And, uh, I have said good-bye to half of them. Well, you know Michael, I have a brother, in Boulder. Rory Flenderson. You should look him up. Okay. Okay? Ahem, Kelly? Kelly? Kelly? What? If I just went away right now, would that be the best gift that I could give you? Yes, please. Please go away and stop using that weird, slow voice. She was once my girl, and she is your girl now. Wow. Yeah. This is totally unnecessary. You're not prone to seizures? No. So Michael said we can do whatever we want cake-wise. What do we want? - Erotic. - See? This is what happens. You can't let a street dog into the house. Mmm, let's hear her out. I would, uh, like to hear more about these cakes. I know these Ethiopians that run a cake shop. Good God. They make these cakes that are wild. I mean They show everything. I don't--I don't think we want a-- No, I know what you're thinking, but it's not just black. They do it all. And the women on these cakes, they're not just guys' fantasies. They have real, full women. It is refreshing. Okay, don't turn this into some feminist issue. As a person who buys a lot of erotic cakes, it just feels good to be represented on one. You know what? I think we should get some other input. I think we should do cupcakes. I am one of the few people who looks hot eating a cupcake. Yeah, cupcakes, that's what I said. No. I am not cleaning up a bunch of uneaten cupcake bottoms. You know, we don't really care about your opinion. You're just a tie-breaker. Um, Pam? Oh, hey, Michael. I'm just gonna go to Carbondale to price some shredders. I'll see you later. Okay. Gabe! I need to talk to you. You can't be in here. This is a ladies' bathroom. No, Erin, I respect your privacy, but I will follow you in here Every time you go if that's what it takes. Hey, creed. Not cool, man. I really think you should leave. Someday, you are going to tell our grandchildren about how their grandfather won you back in a women's room. Gabe, can we talk about this later? I have to go. I have to go. Just read the letter under your windshield wiper. It explains everything. - Okay. - Okay? Do you want-- - Gabe! Well. Here's the thing, Rory. I think you guys would hit it off in an odd way. I could bring him a welcome basket. I'll surprise him. Okay, well, you should give him a little time to settle in, but Does he like jams? My shelves are overflowing with preserves. Well, no, he hates jams. Darryl. Hey. I would like to give you the only copy of somehow I manage, unfinished. If there's anybody here who can finish it, it's you. That's sweet, Mike. Let's see here. Here's a chapter called "gum." - Mmm. - With one sentence. "Everybody likes the guy who offers them a stick of gum." Mm-hmm. It's true. Darryl, I have one last wish. I would like to use the baler. No. Can't let you do that, Mike. - No problem. - Sorry. - Worth a try. - All right. Darryl said I could use the baler because I'm leaving. No. All right, guys, well, see ya later, warehouse. Catch you on the flippety-flip. All right then, see you guys. Catch you later, warehouse. See you on the flippety-flip. Catch you on the flippety-flip. Catch you guys on the flippety-flip. Come on. Okay. So what's our approach? You a veteran? Do I have a month to live? You gonna get married tomorrow? What? I thought we'd just talk about our customer service and exceptional paper quality. That's stupid. Well, what do I know? I know. What you know? We gotta get psyched up. Okay, guy? Let's get psyched. Is there an animal shelter on the way? Yeah. Awesome! Ani-ani-shelto. Here we come. Andy, do you know how to high-five? Yeah. 'Cause if you do, now's the time. All right. Not while I'm driving. Catch you guys Catch you guys on the flippety-flip. Flippety-flip. Flippety-flip. Really? Okay, see you guys. You know how I met Bennet and got started on my ladder of success? No, I don't. Walkin' along, out of workAgain, thinking to myself, I've only got enough cash to buy a sandwich or get drunk. And I see this guy trying to steal this lady's dog. So I grab the dog, he runs off. She's so grateful, she hires me. Aw, wow. Gimme that dog! It's not your dog! Yeah. - Again. - Oh, okay. Gimme that damn dog, you [Bleep] Thief! It's her dog! Don't ever do it again! You hear me? You feel that energy? - Mm-hmm. - Yeah? Whoo! Yeah. Okay, again. I know that Gabe is young and hot and everything, and he's begging me to reconsider, but II just think I'm in love with someone else. Kevin? Andy. I wish I knew who my birth mother was so she could just tell me who to choose. Maybe neither. I'm not attracted to Kevin. Erin, listen to me. You shouldn't rush into this at all. And you know why? Because you are beautiful, and you are fun, and you are smart. And when the right guy comes along, you'll know it. You will. Hey. And you know what? You don't need a mom, because you have my number and you can call me anytime. Extension 147. - N - I know. Okay. Okay. Did you want the 2726 or the 2730? Phyllis? Phyllis, are my mittens done? - No. No. I'm on a sale-- Okay, listen, it's 2:00 P.M. From now until 4:00, your priority is knitting. Knit like the wind. Okay. Dwight, I will be leaving tomorrow. Yes? So I wanted to give you that. It's a letter of recommendation. This is gonna be good. Ahem. "To whom it may concern." Good, real personal. Thanks, Michael. "The dictionary defines 'superlative' "as 'of the highest kind, quality, or order, surpassing all else or others; Supreme.'" that's great. If I wanted the dictionary definition, I'd buy a dictionary. "I define it as Dwight Shrute. "As a sales executive, as a leader, "as a man, and as a friend, "he is of the highest kind, quality, and order; Supreme." Lots more like that. Really repetitive. What's this? "2:45 behind the building, paintball." Come on, come on! Give it up! Yaah! I would like to start by just saying that I have not worked with Mr. Andy Bernard here for very long. But I can say that he is no Michael Scott. I can't sit here and tell you that he's gonna be a success. Uh, I can't sit here and tell you that he's even the best man for the job. But I can say this. He's got potential. Sure. You know, I always say, "go big or go home." You go with this guy, you could be making the biggest mistake of your life. Or the biggest good decision of your life. It's either gonna be the best thing you ever did, or the worst thing you ever did. If you want some boring, white bread clock-watcher, who's gonna get you your paper when you ordered it for the agreed-upon price, Andy's not your guy. You ever play Russian roulette? Time to spin the chamber, Boris By signing up for another year. Uh, what happened to you? You should see the other guy. Jim, where is Pam? Uh, she's still pricing the whatevers The shredders. But it is already 3:00. Right. Whether you're scared of dying or dying alone or dying drunk in a ditch, don't be. It's going to be okay. Yeah, I was tripling up. There's not enough time in the day to have a special moment with everybody. And you, why are you still here? I'm either gonna quit today or stay to make sure that Andy's career is destroyed. No, you are not going to quit today. For goodness sake, this is not going to be your last day at the office. Everybody gets dumped, Gabe. Can I give you a piece of advice? A little cover-up on your Adam's apple will make it appear smaller, which will make you look less like a transvestite. That is cold, sir. Absolutely cold. You know what? It was a complete waste of my time. Uh, Deangelo, I'm, uh I forgot my bag, so I'm gonna I'll meet you in the car. Okay, whatever. Sir. I'd just like to apologize for that. I could tell you that he has a steel plate in his head, or that he's crazy, but the truth is, I think he's just a terrible salesman. And I want you to know that if you re-up with us, anything you need, day or night, I will be the one to take your call. Keep talkin'. Yes. Okay. All right. No. Well, thank you. Thank you. All right. Take care. You'll never guess. We did it. Hey! Ohh! All right. All right. Good job, boss. We did it. Yeah. Okay, everybody, come on. Conference room, five seconds! Here we go! Hurry up! Let's do this! Yes. What is this about? - What is this meeting about? - Mm-hmm. All right. Well Okay. Here we are in the conference room. Once again. And I just wanted to call you all here together because I have something important Well, there's two things, actually. Okay, first, I would like a whereabouts on Pam, and, secondly, Phyllis, how are those mittens coming? Because I would actually like to bring them home and pack them, and I am leaving for the day at 4:00. They're almost done, but my knuckles are swelling a little, and I can't-- Well, power through the arthritis, Phyllis. You can do it. Is that it? Is that it? No. No. There's a special guest that I would like to invite to say one last goodbye, so here he comes. He's coming right in. Hi, everybody! It's ping! And I'm here to say goodbye to all you wonderful people. Thank you, everybody! You've been so wonderful. We were such a good-- I "rove" you all. I "rove" you very much. Hey, can I talk to you for a second? Sure. See you later! So I've been meaning to tell you. I want to take you out for lunch. For your last day. What do you think? Tomorrow? Lunch? You and me? Okay. You're not leaving tomorrow. You're leaving today, right? Maybe. Wow, so that's it, huh? Just 4:00 and you are gone for good. Why am I so sad? Am I doing the wrong thing? Absolutely not. It's just that sometimes goodbyes are a bitch. T-shirt idea. "Goodbyes stink." Okay. All right. So James Halpert You started with this company As a fine young man. You know what I think we should do? I think we should just save the goodbyes for tomorrow. At lunch. Oh. Okay. And then tomorrow I can tell you What a great boss you turned out to be. Best boss I ever had. Oh, shoot. That's my cab. - All right. - All right. Listen, Michael, I really-- I did text Pam, but I know. It's okay. Just give her a hug, all right? I will see you tomorrow at lunch. I am looking forward to lunch. And hearing about what a great boss I am. You got it. Okay. Okay. Phyllis. Mm-hmm. Oh, they're still not done. Oh, no, no, no. Let me see. Oh, Phyllis. Nice try. I love 'em. See ya tomorrow, boss. Later, guys. Well, got almost everybody, so Holly's my family now. She's my family. And the babies that I make with her will be my children. The people that you work with are just, when you get down to it, your very best friends. They say on your deathbed you never wish you spent more time at the office, but I will. Got to be a lot better than a deathbed. I actually don't understand deathbeds. I mean, who would buy that? Well, I guess this is it. Hey, will you guys let me know if this ever airs? Thank you. All right. Oh. This is gonna feel so good getting this thing off my chest. No, he wasn't sad. He was full of hope. About Colorado. And he was hoping to get an upgrade as an awards member. And he said he was just real excited to get home and see Holly. Well, if he's not gonna make it, at least we should go ahead and eat the cake. Yeah. I, for one, love the corners. Why did I just do that? This is not even that good. I don't even-- I don't even want it. I had cake for lunch. No, you know what? I've been good. I deserve this. What am I doing? Come on, Deangelo. Hey No! No! The Office is all new for the rest of the season, so let's see what's new next week. So, coasting time. It's officially over. Big changes are coming, and they're coming fast. And if you don't like them, this is called a door, you can walk right through it, all right? I'm not here to be your friend. I like my life outside of this place. I live to leave at 5:00. Change number one: Darryl. Per your request, the company is sending you to business school at night. Full ride, deal with it. Seriously? Stone cold seriously. They are trying to figure me out, and I don't like it. Once they figure me out they start to tell me what I want to hear. And I need to quickly figure out who's a good worker, and who is simply a good mind reader. Because as soon as I'm hearing what I wanna hear, I'm not gonna care. Toby. You're getting a new chair. - Nice. - Don't thank me. Hey, don't thank me, guy. Okay? And I don't care if you like it. These sound like good ideas, why wouldn't we like them? I don't care what your favorite flavor is. Here's a bowl of ice cream, you either like it or you don't. That's my attitude right now in this room, that's my attitude on ice cream Thursdays. All right? Clear? Any questions? This all sounds great to me. But I could see how some people might think that they're bad. I don't know what to think. That is a-- An astute observation, Kevin. Kev's got me pegged. It blows away Vermont in the fall. Snap, for real? - Not even-- - Good morning, Deangelo. - Hold on, Pam. - Okay. And if you're really serious, you should go in the spring. - 'Cause of the flowers. - No. Because the entire state smells like earth. Dogwoods, or just the earth? Yes, Pam. Hey, well, good morning. I think I have good news for you today. I found your new executive assistant. My friend Carla. She's got great experience, we even considered making her Cece's godmother. But she had this boyfriend at the time. But here's her resume. Put it with the rest. Okay. Hey, dudes. Hey. Hey. - Oh, my God, he hates me. - No, he doesn't. You just get so nervous and hyper around him. I know. Every time there's a silence, you're brain's, like Is that what he tells you at your little inner-circle meetings? Careful, there is no inner circle. Oh, there's an inner circle. Oh, yeah. There is no inner circle. Deangelo just prefers to delegate a few things to a few guys. Jim only says that because he's in the inner circle. I also say that, because I am also in the inner circle. Did you get that, ma? Your boy, Kevin Malone, is in the inner circle. Which doesn't exist. There he is. Got you a coffee. Oh, wow, thank you, that was so kind of you. Not a coffee guy I take it, huh? It's just that I own the coffee shop. So once you've seen sausage being made, all you wanna do is make sausage. 'Cause it's so much fun. Listen, I've got a sixer. "Automatic for the people," on the jukebox. Let's hit the park after sundown, come on. Pick up some sausage if you want. I think you'll find what you're looking for over there. No matter how many times I reach out to Dwight, he doesn't seem to want anything to do with me. It reminds me of my relationship with my son. Except there, I'm the Dwight. Who's the biggest client in the state? I say we go get 'em, whatever it takes. Huh, what do you guys say? - Yes. - Yeah. - Huh, right? - Let's do it. Or my other idea, Yeah, I say that we just go for it. Whoa, is that ball lighter than usual? Is that a Chinatown knock-off? That's "toys r' us" I think. No, that's definitely a knock-off. You can feel the center of gravity is off. Feel that, what do you think? Oh, yeah, totally. Jim, you got ripped off big time. Deangelo! See what I did there? Oh, that's what you need to do. Just add a little English. The British are coming. - Yes. - Deangelo's open! Hey, Ry. Your department's killing it, baby. Hey! My pleasure, my treasure. Keep it up. The problem with having "it," or, "the x-factor," or whatever it is you wanna call it, is that it's impossible to put into words what you're bringing to the table. So to make things simpler for Deangelo, I just, without lying, strongly implied that I'm Kelly's supervisor. It's not even that much of a stretch. She pretty much does whatever I say. What? I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Why should I pretend that you are my boss? Because what would you have done in that situation, Kelly? I'll tell you what I would have done for you. I'd lie for you. Yeah, but you lie all the time. You lie for no reason. Ryan, you just like to lie. I'd die for you too. You really would? Hey, Kelly Kapoor, if I don't have those call logs on my desk, we're just gonna have to evaluate your future at the company. - Sure thing, Mr. Howard. - Whoo. Glad he's not my boss. Ooh, you're the best, thank you. You know I have a cousin who cracked the secret formula for a certain popular cola that I shall not name. So I've never had to buy it. True story. I just drink my cousin's. Congratulations on your one cousin. I have 70-- Each one better than the last. You know what? Straight up, why don't you like me? I'm just not a suck-up like everyone else around here, okay? I do my job well, so why don't you just leave me alone, and let me do it. Okay? Oh, no. - Wha--? - Okay? I'm gonna win you over. No, you're not. - Yes, I am. - No. - Oh, yes. - No. - Yes. - No. - No. - Yes! - Yes! - No! - No. - Yes. - Yes, yes, yes, yes! - No, no! Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! Uh-oh, this former administrative assistant misspelled "administrative," and "assistant." The winner. Under "special skills," Mr. Don finer put "juggling." What's wrong with juggling, Darryl? I'm a big juggler. I actually perform a motivational juggling routine. - Seriously? - Oh, yeah. I'd do it for you here but, uh, what would you say this room is? It's a little cramped. How many square feet out there? Oh, I think it's 18 hundo. Give or take. Sorry, gang. Thought my juggling stuff was in the trunk of my car, but it's not. Oh, no, do you think it was stolen? I got you covered, boss. Used to play with the parabolas myself. Got some extra balls. Hey! Whoa! Sorry, I never touch another juggler's instruments. You know, we're all here, I've got the music cued. Why don't I just do my routine without the juggling balls. Prepare to go into the danger zone. Oh, wow, you weren't kidding. No, never. Can someone please throw me a fifth ball? If you dare. Incoming! And we're on. Remember, nothing's impossible. - Phyllis, where's Phyllis? - Here. Do you believe in me, Phyllis? - Yes. - 'Cause I believe in you. Oh, okay. Feel that connection? Don't move your head, please, thank you. Aah! Big hand for Phyllis. That took a lot of guts. I'm Deangelo Vickers, thank you so much. Hope you learned something. - Whoo! - Whoo! He didn't drop a single ball. Look. I'm juggling eggs and bowling balls. I'm juggling with one hand. No hands. What could he possibly stand to gain from a fake juggling routine? What could he possibly stand to gain from a real juggling routine? How can you keep defending him? He's good at his job, and I like working for him. Of course you do, Jim. You're a man. Deangelo is a huge sexist. Whoa, whoa, whoa. I think if he was a sexist I'd be able to tell. I took a crapload of women's studies courses at Cornell. And I wrote my own companion piece to the vagina monologues called the penis apologies. So I know a thing or two. Okay. Then how about I'm the head of the accounting department, but he only ever talks to Kevin. What about Pam and Kelly? Also department heads, but has he ever met with you? Or even asked you to do anything? Huh, how could I not see it? You're so right. Why don't you talk to him about it? And say what? Hey, Deangelo, are you shy or just a sexist? Why don't you just tell him how his actions are being perceived by the women in this office. And if he doesn't listen then he can kiss his penis goodbye. Snip snip. Am I right, girls? Hey, do you have a second? Yeah, I got tons of time, this job's a joke. So what's up? Um, really, it's nothing. I was just talking to Angela. - Mm-hmm. - And she was-- - Hey. Saw Jim come in, are we meeting? Yeah, sure, let's make it a meeting. If it's all right, can I just have, like, one minute alone, just to go over-- What's the big secret? Why are you even whispering? Come on, it's the guys. I know, just the guys. Well, maybe that's part of the problem, I think. So what happened was, I was talking to some of the department heads. Right. Uh, some of the female department heads. - Uh-oh. - Yeah. - Right? - Hot. Maybe there's a vibe out there with certain members of the office that you are a little sexist, or-- - Damn! - Whoa. Whoa, wait. Are you serious? Who feels this way? - Oh, like, nobody, it was-- - Uh, Pam? Was it Pam? Oh, my gosh. That sounds like Pam. Yeah. You know how she gets. Deangelo, she can get really bitchy. Kevin, wah-wah. - Guys. - Hold on. Doesn't matter who, okay? I'm just happy that Jim brought it to my attention. Because honestly, I had no idea. - That's awesome. - Thank you. Mom, Ryan's taking us out to dinner tonight. No, no, he's not gonna stand us up like he did last time. He won't ever stand us up again. So I am the new customer service supervisor. When deangelo's around. - And I'm also a very dutiful boyfriend when-- - All the time. - All the time. Erin, do you mind running down to the lobby and bringing up my brand-new executive assistant? Absolutely. Hey, who'd you end up hiring? I'm glad you asked, Jim. Because apparently there's a rumor running around here that I'm a sexist. I can't work here effectively if you guys think I'm something that I'm not. I'm not a sexist. Raise your hand if you have a vagina. Raise your hand if someone you love has a vagina. Yeah, yeah, okay. Just about everyone. What about deangelo's hand? Oh, wow. He's got 'em both up. Yeah. Uh-huh, yeah. So it bothers me when I hear that there's gossip around here that I treat women lesser than men. Okay? Frankly, we all look a little ridiculous when that happens. I'm not a feminist, but I think that the men in this office are being given chances that the women aren't. Dwight. What's your take? What's the argument here? NBA, WNBA. One is a sport, one is a joke. I love sports, I love jokes. Room for all. Man, your smart. Oh, hey, hi. Hello. Hi. Welcome. Uh, everyone. I'd like you to please welcome Jordan garfield. This is everyone. Hello. So Jordan, uh, where did you work before? Uh, a law office? No, anthropologie. "We don't have this and that size." Pretty--pretty lame. - Hm. Lame? You worked at anthropologie? - Yes. - That's, like, my dream job. How did you even get that job? Well, I, um-- You chose this job over that job? Okay, okay, back to work, Kelly. We have a lot to get done today. So, um, is this your first office job then? - Yeah. - Yup. Wow. No corporate experience whatsoever. I didn't want anyone with any bad habits. Jim, you coming? Oh, yeah, did he text us? Yeah. No! Jim, what are you doing? Get in there. This is not the time to take a stand, at least he likes one of us. He didn't text me. Yes! I'm in. Andy, what are you doing? Uh, I'm going in to the belly of the beast. I'm gonna infiltrate and change from within. What's up, man cave! - Just go in. - Hm? Just go in, he probably just forgot to text you. Internally for office use. Where do we get our paper from? Do we go and--do we have that system? Don't worry, the first day's always the hardest. Yeah. - Hey, Jim. - Yeah. Can I help you? Nope, just Okay. So, he kicked you out of the inner circle, huh? No, there is no inner circle. Dwight? Deangelo wanted me to ask you if there's anything I could help you with? Really? Anything? Do you need anything? Deangelo? Tell your whore to leave me alone! Okay, I do not wanna waste your time, so I will keep this brrrrrrrrief! Now, word on the street is mercy hospital. Back on the market. Deangelo would like you to put together a sales pitch for next week. Deangelo has also recently learned about the barnacle project, which is a non-profit organization based in mystic, Connecticut, that assists in the scraping of barnacles-- So this is my life. Until I win the lottery. Or Pam finally writes that series of young adult books. So one afternoon while walking home from school, quirky tenth grader Becky Walters finds a wounded Pegasus in the woods. And she becomes "the horse flyer." Hey, Kelly, that's the last time I'm gonna talk to you about your paycheck, okay? We pay you a fair salary here and if you're only here for the money, maybe you shouldn't be here at all. No one likes a money-grubber. I'm sorry, Mr. Howard. I apologize for grubbing for money-- I can't do this, I can't do this. I--I'm sorry, I just can't do it. Deangelo, Ryan is not my boss, okay? Frankly, he hasn't had a real job here in years. Oh, that's hilarious, Kelly. No, he's just a big fraud, Deangelo. He's like Rango. He doesn't work here, basically, just like the way Rango didn't save those animals. It was just a big misunderstanding. Is this true, Ryan? I did not see Rango. Okay, I don't have time for this "he said, she said." He's not saying anything! It's too murky. I like Ryan, you seem kind of hysterical to me. Ryan's your supervisor. Let's just leave it that way. But it's not fair, I've been working here for such a long ti-- Close call. Okay, why don't you just finish this up and leave it on my desk and I will see you at your place around 2:00 A.M., huh? Oh-ho-ho, yeah! Oh, angry, angry dunk. Hey. It sounds like you guys are having a lot of fun, but it's really loud and some of us are trying to work, so Okay. Do you think you could do it a little more quietly? Well, that's gonna be tough because we're getting a dunking clinic from magic Jordan himself. Oh, you mean, uh, Michael Jordan? Total brain-burp. I'm no MJ. Please. I can do his dunk, from the free-throw line though. Damn! Mad respect from a brother! The man is paying me to take Chinese. I will say what I need to say. And soon, I will say it in Chinese. Okay, well, it's just really loud. Okay. We'll keep that in mind. All right, ladies. Back to the game. Do it! And Jim. Come on in. You're back in. You know what? Instead of a game, why don't we do an exhibition? Love to see that dunk of yours. Yeah, we'll set that up one day. Today. Now, maybe. 'Cause we have a hoop downstairs. And a real ball, so you don't have to mime it. Yeah, I don't know. Why not? Only because no one has called NASA to request a lift-off. - Let's go downstairs, okay? - Let's definitely do that. - Let's do it. - Pass. If I wanted to see a pissing contest I'd lock Mose in the chicken Coop. Damn it, Dwight, enough! Get your ass downstairs, or find a new place to sell paper! Okay, a little about me. I respond to strong leadership. - All right, there you go. - Seems a little close. You're sure that's the real foul line? So you need me to move it in? Nah, that's 15. Yeah. Okay. And, uh, you know what, to make it interesting, Jordan, why don't you sit underneath the basket? - Seriously? - Yeah, come on. I'll dunk over you, best seat in the house. - I don't--I don't think I can do that. I'm holding your jewelry. Right, yeah. Okay, fair enough. Kevin, you do it. - Yes, okay. - Why don't you? Here? Someone wanna sit in Kevin's lap? - Angela? - No. - Oscar? - No, thank you. Okay, Jimmy, this is for you, to show you that anything is possible. - Fantastic. - All right? - Yup. - This is also for the troops. Doctor is in! Now what? - Deangelo? - Tablab. Oh, my God, are you all right? Erin, would you call 911 please? Who should I say is calling? Erin. Chea three thead twa to bar. Scoince? Paunch and loud. Paunch says to barter how's gonna tha. Barte sayce four tha pa. Everybody tine, everybody tha. Everybody tha. Dra tweb. Yeah. Dra sweb. Treasure, yeah, I get it. Okay, we're gonna work on treasure. We can get Deangelo flowers. No, you can't get flowers for someone who's in a coma. They'll wilt before he wakes up. - Yeah, that's true. - Good point. All in favor of the baskets full of chocolates, Teddy bears, and balloons. Wait, wait. All in favor of the knapsack filled with canned goods, chainsaw, gasoline, and emergency radio in case he wakes up post-apocalypse Nope. Baskets have it. So as it turns out, unless you're a young child or a prison inmate, you don't need anyone supervising you. People just come in and do their work on their schedule. Imagine that-- People like us allowed to sell paper. Unsupervised. And yet, somehow it works. It must be because the stakes are so high. Well, I really appreciate the offer, but I'm just happy the way things are. Okay. Thank you. That was Jo asking me if I wanted to take over as acting manager while they find a replacement. I told her I don't want to mess this up, right? There's a consensus. People are happy. [Telephone rings] [Ring] Dwight Schrute. Yes, I would. Thank you. Jordan. Gather my things from my desk. Wait [Door slams] What have you done? Mose You'll never guess where I am right now. Aaaaahhhhh! [Cheerful music] [Knocking at glass] Can't stay there all day. I'm coming. Do I at least get to go with you in this fantasy? You'd slow me down. Dwight has been acting manager forThree months now. No. A week. Just feels like three months. Let's see We all have to punch into a time clock which is very old, very strong, and has a slot about the size of a finger. We were all given new business cards big enough to set us apart from the competition. Which is how I learned that our titles are all now junior employee. Our lunch breaks are staggered to prevent wasting time. Mine's at 10:30. And I find that the first hour of the day goes by a lot quicker than the second seven hours. Stop stalling. Come on. All: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. - Amen. - Excellent. Morning announcements. There's been a problem with some people sharing copier codes. Your copier code is a distinct 21-digit number that is unique to you and you only, okay? Don't share it. Jo Bennett, our ceo, will be here today for a high-level meeting involving Gabe and myself. Ooh. About what? That's on a need-to-know basis. I thought I needed to know for your calendar. General meet and greet. So I expect you to be on your best behavior, which means none of you will be insubordinate nor will you foment insurrection. Question. If we've already fomented insurrection, may we be grandfathered in? - Define foment. - You define foment. [Ahem] Please take note of the new color-coding system. Aha! Oh, my God! What is wrong with you? Gotcha! Why are you late? It's none of your business, actually. It's very medical and personal. All right. You stop me when I reach the diseased area. In fairness, Darryl did tell me that joke, so Oh! Darryl's funny. - I know, right. - Hey, Andy? - Yeah. - Can I talk to you a second about these client memos? Sure. What's going on? Are you still in love with Erin? What? Because I am. I need to get her back. [Crying] I can't be alone anymore. Andy, do you like being alone with me right now? No. This is horrifying. No. I don't like being alone with me either, okay? [Crying] I have to get her back. Are you still gonna date her? We're just friends, okay? Do you promise that? Yeah, fine, I promise. We'll never date again. Can we go outside now? No. Just give me a second. I don't want anyone to know I've been crying. Hey, hey, hey, hey. What do you think you're doing? What's this? What's the fist? Oh, it's just a social club. You know, like the French revolution or the black panthers or communism. It's just a club. Guys talkin'. You know. You expect me to believe that you're starting a rebellion? Nope. Social club. God, I hate when everybody calls us a rebellion. Okay, you know what? I would love to join the fist. And we would love to have you-- But not today. Unfortunately, it's a bad day, what with operation overthrow and everything. But I have noted it. [Beep] One [Beep beep] [Beep beep] [Beep beep] Pam, I have to show you this video. You're gonna love it. It's Beyonce falling With a fart mixed in. [Buzzer] I will never be happier than I am right now. I will also be never less happy. I will be at my current maximum happiness for the rest of my life, because I am manager of the Scranton branch of Dunder-Mifflin. Acting manager. No food now! Someone has to do something about Dwight. He put some snacks in the freezer for us. You mean the frozen mice for the piranha? No. The blueberry slurpee pouch. Hmm. He means the ice pack. be okay. I can either take your number or-- I'm sorry. This can't wait. He's just gonna call back. Erin. I am in love with you. I don't believe in much, okay? I don't believe in horoscopes. I don't believe in Christmas. Uh, uh, I sure as hell don't believe in God. [Quietly] What? Or maybe there's a God. I don't know. I mean, it's just not a guy with a long white beard. Or it could be. I mean, it's possible that that is exactly what-- What God is. But for all of the disbelief [Telephone rings] I believe in us. I believe in love. [Ringing] You have made me believe that for all of the hokum [Ringing] OutThere Uh, do we not have voice mail? Dwight doesn't trust robots to give us our messages. [Ringing] Well It's just [Ringing] It messes up my rhythm. But I'm taking a break from dating. Gabe was a great guy with so many wonderful qualities, but it was a challenge being touched by him. Wow. You've really embraced the whole bond villain aesthetic. Ah, Jim, Jim, Jim. The gun is a beaumont-Adams. Jo collects them. I thought we could have some nice small talk about it. And the piranha's a rescue. And the desk. The desk is a replica of Uday Hussein's desk. I saw a picture in newsweek. Listen, I'm a very busy man. Let's get right down to business. - Okay. - Jo is coming later today. I cannot have a subordinate trying to make me look stupid. Okay? I need you to promise me that you'll be on your best behavior. I promised other people that I'd be on my worst behavior. And I gave them my word, so Don't make me fire you. You can't fire me. You're acting manager. Not office manager. So you have no firing powers. Don't make me pre-fire you. You wouldn't dare. Watch this. You're pre-fired. And when I'm promoted, you'll be full fired. [Quietly] If you get promoted, and if you haven't fallen in love with me by then. What? If I had thought that there was a real chance that Dwight would be permanent manager, I would have pre-quit. And you might be saying to yourself, "well, that's pretty premature to think," but I always say it's better to be pre-pre-preprepared. - How you doing, Jordan? - I'm good. Everyone here thinks that you're a joke. They think that you were hired because of your good looks, which won't last long anyway. As your pale skin and severe bone structure imply, you'll age swiftly and poorly. Why are you telling me this? Now I want you to find out what people are saying about me, things they don't want me to know abou-- Ohh It's a holster. Yep. Yep, yep, yep. Lookin' good. [Grunts] Ohh Oh, what a day. What a day. Dwight, are you carrying a gun? The holster was a gift from my great-uncle honk. Um, I don't know. I guess he's saying that he's proud of me. Dwight, guns make me really uncomfortable. The gun is just an accessory to the holster, okay? I can't walk around wearing an empty holster. Why do you need to wear the holster at all? Why do you need to keep wearing those booby shirts all the time? Thank you. You could put your cell phone in it instead. UhHello! You could put a banana in it. Why would I put a banana in my holster? In case you weren't hungry now but you got hungry later. Dwight, no gun, okay? Don't make us call Jo. Okay, all right, fine. Everyone calm down. Someone get me a banana. - Sorry I freaked you guys out-- - Aah! Andy! Aah! God! It's so loud! Oh my God. There is a hardwood floor underneath this carpeting. Why would they do that? Eeeeeee There's like this crazy ringing going on. I can't-- Eeeeeeee. * Eeee * I can't find perfect c. Okay, everyone make a list of what's lost for the insurance. I lost a necklace, a ring, painting-- Hey, what happened? Dwight went on a shooting spree, and then he shot Andy in the head. No, no, no. All we know is that a gun fired. That's all we know! No. That's not true. Actually, we heard a loud noise. Later, a hole was seen. No one saw the bullet leave the gun. - [Off-key scatting] [Stammering] Something's definitely wrong. I'll look on WebMD. What are your symptoms? Oh, everybody. Oscar found a reason to look on WebMD. [Buzzer] Firewall. I can't reach Jo-- She must already be on the plane. Why are you calling Jo? I think I should go to the hospital. - I'll go with you. - No! We really shouldn't be without a receptionist. Now more than ever. I'll take him. Thank you, Darryl. What's wrong with you? - It's my ear. - Yeah. Yes, sir. Oh. I should get the accident report binder. I've never used the gun violence forms before. I'm gonna keep trying Jo. Okay, everyone-- Conference room. Right now! Yee-haw! Whoo-hoo! [Imitating gunfire] Howdy, partners. It's me, gun-safety Dwight. And I'm the rootin'est-- I can't do this. Um, look. Obviously, a gun went off under my watch, and I'm launching a full investigation. We all saw you do it. Really? You did? What hand was I holding the gun in? What did Andy's tie look like? Navy blue. Little red anchors. I have no way of knowing if that's true. I am supposed to collect eyewitness accounts. Who saw Dwight do this? Okay, really? Would you consider this a terrorist incident? - I felt terrorized. - Come on. Oh, there's a whole nother terrorism booklet for that. I just really, really think that we should handle this internally. Dwight, why is it on us to protect you? Because you guys are my best friends, and I mean that. Managing you for this last week has been the greatest honor of my life. And if you ruin this, I will burn this office to the ground. And I mean that figuratively. Not literally. Because you guys are so So important to me. I love you guys. But don't cross me. But you're the best. - Hey. - [Gasps] - We're back. - There he is! Our hero! You look fantastic. How you doing? Here. Tell us your war stories. Well, I burst my eardrum. Doctor said it could take weeks to heal. Did they say what caused it? 'Cause I know you like putting q-tips deep into your ear canal. Yeah. How's your hearing? Temporary deafness in one ear. It was both ears. I couldn't hear a thing Darryl was saying when we were in the waiting room. I was talking like this: [Mouthing words] I don't feel good about it, but he just kept calling himself a gunshot victim, and it got to me. Dwight, I would like tomorrow off so that I can go on my American idol audition. American idol? What? No. Okay. I guess I can just not go. Do you guys wanna hear my solo? No. * Why did my temporary boss * * go on a shooting spree? * Okay. Fine. You can go on your singing audition. Okay, well, then I want an extra vacation day. Pet day. I want pet day back-- No dogs. Put back everything in the vending machine except the fruit. I put everything back in the vending machine. Put everything back in the vending machine exceptThe fruit. You have to get rid of all your weapons. All of them. Including killer fish. Okay. Oh, it's my turn? Ooh, I'm on the spot. I don't know. Um You know what? I think I'm good. - Thank God. - Nope. When Jo's here, can you work in "shagadelic, baby," at least three times in a conversation? Oh, and when I cough, can you do jazz hands? What's jazz hands? Fine. [Toilet flushes] What the fuck is that? Oh, my Hey, all! Cornelius, Bobo, have at it. Nobody let my dogs hump each other. They don't seem to know they're brothers. Hello, Jo. Welcome. Well, shall we begin? Slow yourself down there. Just like a man. Wants to jump right into it while I still got my socks on. Jim Halpert-- The only man that ever turned me down. Well, I don't know about that. Just wasn't for me. But let me assure you, Dwight is firing on all cylinders. Right? Well, some pretty big shoes to fill. I was sorry to hear about Deangelo. He was a good man. Tragic. [Coughs] Well, what can you do? Life. - We have to clean this up now! - She had so much-- - Hey, guys. - Hey. Hope I'm not interrupting anything. [Both laughing] No! Hey, Andy, did you tell Erin about our conversation earlier when you said you would never want to date her again? I just thought that it was so interesting that you promised that. Did I say that earlier? Yes, I did. Because you, Gabe, were crying - No, I was not. - And sobbing uncontrollably. Yes. Uh-huh. You were in hysterics. And my maternal instincts kicked in. Is it actually how I feel? Yes. Or no. That is Between me and my diary. Oscar, can you print out last year's sale statements? - Sure. - Hey, Dwight. Gimme a back massage. No, Kevin, come on. My back is sore, Dwight. Massage it. Kevin, not now. - Hey, Jo - Okay, okay. Shh! No. Under the jacket. You're kidding me. Oh God, what am I touching? It's moist. - I don't feel anything. - Oh, it's so wet. - Push harder, Dwight. - I can't. I can't push harder! - Go a little higher. - I-- [Grunts] There. There you go. Nope. Higher. I c-- Higher. - Oh, my God! - There we go. Okay. How's that? Knead it. Knead it like a pizza. - I'm kneading it! - But don't eat it. Okay Dwight. Walk me out. Oop. Let's talk soon. And stay on top of these people. You gotta admit it-- It's nice to have a little power, eh? How's it feel? Jo I accidentally fired a gun in the office today. - What? - I am telling you this because I care too much about this job to be blackmailed into doing it poorly. All I've ever wanted is to be manager here. And if you feel like you cannot promote me over this one accident, I understand. But if you think that extortion is worse-- Shooting is worse! Are you kiddin' me? It's not even in the same-- You shot a gun? What is wrong with you? It was a Beaumont-Adams, if that helps. Beaumont-Adams is a girl's gun. That just makes it plain stupid. I take full responsibility. Who else would be responsible? Pam made me put a banana in my holster. You shot a gun off-- Okay. Did I make a mistake? Yes. Do I regret the decision that I made? Yes. Stop asking yourself easy questions so you can look like a genius. - Got it. - I love you, Dwight. But you don't fit this job. Jo, please - No. - I will-- No, child. No. It's over. Now I gotta find a replacement for my replacement. You three are my search committee. You're in charge of finding me my next manager. All righty? - Yep. - Yep. Till then, we need a new actin' manager. Now, who's got the most experience in this office? Uh, well, we probably don't wanna go just on seniority. Who is it? Hey, Dwight. What's up? Shut up. Okay. Well You do know that Jo was right to take the job away from you, right? There's no debating that. But I will say In your one week, every single one of the orders went out on time, [slurps liquid] And I think that is shagadelic, baby. Four. One. Seven. One. Another one? - Yes! - Yes! Seven. - Two, six, - Could you turn down the beeping? nine, shut up Oscar, eight Nine first, put the nine. - Nine, eight, five, - Thank you. Three, zero, zero - Again, zero. - Okay. - Four, six - Nice. - Two, one. - I hit three, I head three instead of God!   It's a beautiful morning at Dunder Mifflin--  Or as I like to call it Great Bratton.  Keep it running.  Do I love being manager?  I love my kids. I love real estate.  I love ceramics. I love my job.  I-I love wrestling.  Find out what language this is.  Okay. Team building.  On this side of the room, Stanley, Phyllis, Jim,  Ted, Elroy.  On this side of the room, Pam, Meredith, Phyllis, Creed  He never called a meeting.  BoBody. BoBody.  What does the first "b" stand for?  What are we doing?  We're making acronyms. Okay!  What does the first "b" stand for?  Business!  I like it!  Business.  Good, Kevin!  All right, the "o"  We need a new manager.   Your paper experience is very interesting.  Do you think you could use that experience  to inform decisions here?  Absolutely, I-- Yes.  In fact, I actually have a three-step plan  that I believe could effectively double your profits.  - Really? - Yeah.  What is it?  Nice try.  Uh I'm sorry.  W-what is your three-step plan?  Well, I mean, I can't just hand you my plan.  I mean, if you guys give me the job,  then-- Then you'll get the plan.  Welllt's an interview,  and we don't know that you really have the plan.  I'm not gonna just make up that I have a plan.  I got a plan. Believe me, you guys want it.  You're in paper, right?  How do we know that if you don't  You could just be saying it to get the job.  I guess I could be if I was  Who would do that?  How about this.  Why don't you give us a part of the plan,  and that way we know you have it.  Tell you what.  I'll give you part three of part two.  Not gonna give you a whole part.  Okay.  Color-code said document. TM.  - Did you just trademark that? - W-what?  That's a verbal trademark. That's an agreement.  We are the search committee  Hand-picked by our CEO  and tasked to find this branch's new manager.  Not everyone we meet will be good,  but someone's bound to be, right?  And to be honest,  I think a lot of the decent candidates  are right here in house.  So I'm not too worried.  But I'm really excited to spend a lot of time  with Toby and Gabe.  Did you know that Gabe's last name was Lewis?  I had no idea.  Good morning.  - Morning. - Good morning.  Good morning.  Did you have a nice drive in?  I did.  I have a solid relationship with Jo,  the company's owner.  I have management experience.  I have a good friendship with Jim,  the head of the search committee.  And it doesn't hurt that I'm  * Black! *  It's good. I really hope you get it.  The manager job? Naw, I'm barely interested.  I just can't not go for it, you know.  It's not the Bernard way.  We give it the old college try,  and then in defeat, we show grace.  StillI'd really like to see this office  with you in the boss's chair.  Don't even  - You in the boss's chair! - Eeehhh! No.  In my family, you don't really go out and get things.  If you want something, you write it on a list  and then the housekeeper goes out and gets it  on wednesdays and Fridays.  SoI don't know.  I guess you could say this job is on my list and  We'll see what rosa comes back with.  Did you hear anything?  OhI'm sure they'll let us know  when they get the results.  It turns out that Erin was born  in the basic time and region that I gave away a child.  So Phyllis might be my mom.  I mean, the chances are tiny, but  Yeah. But probably not.  I mean, it was a big year for babies.  Porky's had come out. Yeah.  I'm sure I was just another porky's baby.  But why not find out? Yeah.  Should you really be so blatant about that?  They won't make me manager,  and I won't settle for anything less.  I've gone about as far as I can here.  That's obvious.  Time to take my talents elsewhere.  Are you really gonna apply for work  at Scranton Breadworks?  Bread is the paper of the food industry.  You write your sandwich on it.  Can you do any better on salary?  Unfortunately, that range is set at corporate.  What about mileage when I use my car?  I mean, gas ain't cheap, you know.  We think that  How 'bout 27 and, uh  When I make long-distance calls  will they be monitored, or is it on the honor system?  Okay.  How odd!  A very unusual phone call from the senator's office.  The senator wants me to have lunch with him  at the botanical gardens.  The botanical gardens  Scranton's hidden gem.  Don't eat any berries you don't recognize.  How will your experience selling refinery equipment  translate to our smaller scale here?  You don't work in sales, do you?  UhHuman resources.  You see, I sit across from a man  I see his face. I see his eyes.  Now, does it matter if he wants $100 of paper  or $100 million of deep-sea drilling equipment?  Don't be a fool.  He wants respect.  He wants love.  He wants to be younger. He wants to be attractive.  There is no such thing  as a product.  Don't ever think there is.  Ere is only sex.  Everything is sex.  You understand that what I'm telling you  is a universal truth, Toby.  Yes.  Okay, I-I--  I amI'm almost a little concerned  that you might be overqualified for the position.  Do you, um Do you think that you are?  Do I look like someone who--  Who'd waste my own time?  No.  Can y--  You are a man of great confidence.  Could you speak a little more to that  and what the role of confidence  would be in a dialogue  with a subordinate?  Will you be heard?  Will you have a voice?  Will I steamroll over you?  Do you feel heard right now, Jim?  Do you have a voice right now?  You can answer me. Yes.  That was your choice, not mine.  The fallacy is that it is up to the steamroller.  It is up to the object  Whether it will be flattened or not.  And I can tell just from the small interaction  we've had already,  you won't be flattened by anybody.  Do you agree with me, Jim?  - Yes. - Yes, you do.  He creeps me out.  But I think he might be a genius.  Good luck, Darryl.  Thank you.  Think about it.  What other mammal, besides humans,  drinks the milk of another mammal?  I mean, you don't see a bear drinking raccoon milk.  So this is cool. I think we make a good fit.  Oh. Uh, we haven't started the interview yet.  Were you-- Were you joking?  UhYes. I was.  Little joke.  So how would you go about settling interpersonal conflicts  within the office?  I thought that was your job.  Well, it's one of my strengths,  but it's the manager's job.  Well, for instance, how did you deal with it  when two warehouse guys got into a fight?  I'll answer that, Jim.  I would use it as an opportunity to teach  Uh, about actions and consequences  of actions.  Who's that?  So I think all we need is a resume,  and we'll be good, right?  I-I just thought you knew me.  Yeah, it's no big deal.  Just something that looks like that.  Cool.  Let me  Cool.  Did, uh, you just interview?  Oh. Unfortunately, yes.  W-what do you mean?  That business can't attract anyone.  It's awful up there.  Those people seem like they're in prison  waiting out life sentences  in a Dying industry.  Place must be horrible.  I don't know if I want this job.  Well, if I get this job offer,  then I know that I'm gonna take it.  And if I take it, I know that I'm never gonna quit.  And then 25 years are gonna go by, and  I'm gonna die here.  What makes you feel qualified to judge a place  after a mere interview?  What are you doing?  Stop trying to figure me out.  - I just did. - You can't.  - It's done. - No, it's not.  I know you now. I know your nature.  You don't know me-- You don't know anything about me.  - I'm done. - Get out of my head.  - Not worth continuing. - Stop trying to figure me out.  Do you even know anything about paper?  How it's made?  I saw an episode on how they make paper  on sesame street.  Get out.  I'm gonna prevent inferior men  from sullying my place of work  with their weak, passionless leadership.  Do you see my hat? No?  That's because I just threw it in the ring.  You guys pay for relocation, though, right?  Well, why would you need relocation  if you already live in Scranton?  Well, I'd wanna move further away, you know?  JustDon't want any chance  of running into my coworkers outside the office.  Can I ask why you're leaving your current job?  I'm leaving my other job  because they were all Jerks.  Really. You know, all of them.  You had your jerk wads and your jerk offs, so  Just between the wads and the offs,  I just-- I had to get outta there.  Is this a bad time to be doing this?  I'm having a bad time.  I'm sorry.  I-if we did something to upset you,  I-I'm sure it was inadvertent.  Wait.  Oh, why did I believe that weirdo in the lobby?  These are the nicest people I ever met.  Thank you.  It's gorgeous, Angela.  Yeah, I actually know about nice rings,  and it is gorgeous. OhWow.  It's a little flashy. I mean, what am I  Naomi judd?  - Tell us the freaking story! - Yeah, tell us the story.  Okay. He took me to the replica  of Monet's Japanese bridge.  And then he put this flower behind my ear,  which normally I would hate,  'cause it's so civil rightsy.  Then he got down on one knee and he said,  "will you be a senator's wife?"  Oh! He talked about himself in the third person?  Yes, Pam.  Not everyone is as informal as you and Jim.  "Oh, hey, Pam, dude, whatever.  Wanna marry me?"  That's not accurate.  Then I saw flashes. Reporters were there.  They always find us. And everyone was crying.  Even his aide.  Angela's engaged to a gay man.  As a gay man, I'm horrified.  As a friend of Angela's, horrified.  As a lover of elegant weddings,  I'm a little excited.  But overall, horrified.  Andy?  You all set?  Okay, guys. It's time.  It's pep talk time. Tell me what I need to hear.  Are you sure this is a good idea?  I hate to see you disappointed.  I think Andy should be the boss.  He's just so great.  If I'm being objective, then Darryl, of course.  So Andy, what improvements would you make  as office manager? For starters, I really think  we can streamline communication around here.  Whoa. That's a very heavy accusation  to level against Toby.  - I wasn't a-accusing-- - Well, Toby's in charge  of human resources.  That would include communication.  I think that Toby's done a fine job.  Right. I-I-I really wasn't trying to insult a-anyone.  I didn't think you were.  I have two relationships with Andy.  I have a personal relationship,  and I have a professional relationship.  Personally, yeah, I think he's a rat  and I think he's responsible  for the demise of my relationship with Erin.  Professionally  He broke up the happiest couple in this office.  How many windows are there in New York City?  - What? - Critical thinking.  Common on-the-spot question asked in an interview.  Okay. UhLet me think. Are you counting car windows?  No. How far away is the sun?  Uh, 93 million Miles.  - Is it? - Yeah.  And the diameter of the sun is 870,000 miles,  which makes it 109 times wider than the earth  and 333,000 times heavier than the earth.  Shut up about the sun.  Shut up about the sun!  I am unhappy with the confusing  and, at times, confrontational nature of that meeting.  I wanted it to go better.  I wanted it to go better!  Yes, there used to be a paper clip  that would pop up and say,  "looks like you are writing a letter or resume.  Would you like help?"  I believe his name was Clippy.  First of all, I wanna thank you  for your years of patronizing our company.  I've got some bad news.  We're going out of business.  Saving face.  Yep, yep.  I understand that.  Basically everything's falling apart here.  How is this on me?  Hang up.  Corporate needs you to find the differences  between this picture and this picture.  Intel has told us there are at least seven.  Okay. I already see one. Gimme.  Okay.  They're the same picture.  Well, I manage my department,  and I've been doing that for several years now.  And, God, I've learned a lot of life lessons along the way.  Your department's just you, right?  Yes, Jim, but I am not easy to manage.  Great. Um, can we just  - What was that? - We just have  a lot of serious candidates to get through today, so  Am I not a serious candidate?  What do you want me to say?  I mean, there's a line of qualified people out there.  We have a video CV from England.  Are we all just gonna pretend to--  okay. Um  What are your weaknesses?  I don't have any, asshole.  I want an interview.  How's the family? Good.  - Good? Are they good? - Yeah.  What's your daughter's name again?  Peepee?  - Peepa. - Peepa. How is she?  - Great. - Great!  Oh, that's great.  We never were very good at smalltalk, were we, Jim?  - No. - Now, listen--  You're not getting an interview, Dwight.  The whole point of this search committee process  is to prevent hiring someone like you ever again.  Okay. I know why you're saying that, Jim.  I really do. But think of it this way.  The hand that reaches from the grave  to grip your throat  is the strong hand you want on the wheel.  - Okay. That's vivid. - Now, I'm gonna make you  an offer, okay?  You even do so little as grant me an interview,  I will guarantee you your dream work life, okay?  You roll in at 10:00 AM  to your own private reserved parking spot,  pick up your daily free coffee from Dwight's caffeine corner,  unlimited sex breaks for you and Pam.  - Yikes. - Erin will eat garbage  for your entertainment.  Wow. You know how I like taking bribes.  - Ha ha! - But unfortunately,  jo also took the job away from you  because she doesn't trust your judgment.  So how would that look for me  if I recommended you?  Fine.  I'll do it without you. You'll regret this.  Okay.  Let me get that for you.  - Thank you. - Okay.  Pam, I think Robert is gay.  The senator?  He was married before, and he has a kid.  - So-- - And don't say that thing  about how lots of gay guys have kids.  I have a very strong suspicion.  Did you see him at a bathhouse?  What bathhouse?  The windowless building by the Baskin Robbins.  What?  Forget it. I'm never gonna know what goes on there.  My friend at the Scranton blade  is totally plugged into these matters.  You're in the gay mafia.  You're thinking of another group--  Much wealthier, much older. You sound ignorant.  You guys, um Talking senator?  - No. - No.  Why would we be talking about the senator?  'Cause he's totally gay.  How do I know that Robert is gay?  He "liked" my Facebook photos  at 3:00 in the morning.  Name-- David Brent. Occupation-- Inspirer.  Status-- None of your business.  Young, free, and single, though.  Thanks for asking.  Hey, you're looking for a new boss, yeah?  Someone to tell a bunch of discontented,  under-encouraged drones what to do every day.  Is that it? Oh. Our out-of-touch powers that be.  Want me to fire them? They don't see things your way?  Then I am that dude. Bye-bye, baby, bye-bye.  Get some other corporate suit to lay down the law.  What? You've changed your mind?  You're now looking for a leader of men?  Ipso factoWomen too.  When do I start?  Do you know what it took to get Bob to notice me?  I waited in his office every morning  wearing nothing but kitty cat ears.  I did that every day for two weeks.  And on the tenth day, he walked in.  He was naked too, except a dog nose.  - Guess what we did then? - I don't think I can do that--  - Bestiality. - Yeah.  That's not my personality.  If my daughter were asking me  Yes?  I would say if you want someone--  If you really want them--  Go get them.  I do really want him.  So, uh Here you go.  - Great. - Hope it's all right.  I'm sure it's fine.  The guy who was in here earlier,  interviewed after me How'd he do?  Howard cline?  That's not who I'm talking about.  Oh. Deshaun Williams.  Yes. How did he do?  He's an amazing man. He's a rhodes scholar.  He invented an app that invents apps.  Fantastic kisser.  Common, man. I'm being serious.  It's no joke. Darryl, we all know you.  Your interview is not nearly as important as the other guy's.  First I'll take down  - the cubicle walls. - But there aren't--  Symbol of transparency.  There'd be no titles.  Everyone has the same job.  Same goes for me.  I'd take your job, but I'd reject the title.  A little unspecific.  Everyone would be known  for their accomplishments.  That's very interesting.  UmI feel like there might be a conflict there,  and if a conflict did arise, how would that be dealt with?  Oh! Yeah.  Scratch everything from before.  I tell you what I'd do. Go the other way.  More cubicles.  More division.  Everyone is somebody's boss,  and that person can fire the person below them.  And once a month the lowest-performing person--  Bye-bye.  How would you compare like an accountant and HR?  Well, I'll tell you how, shall I?  I'll tell you how. Okay.  By splitting the difference.  Just--just somewhere in the middle.  I think that's probably all  We need to hear from--  Zen office.  Thought of that? That's what I'd do.  Everyone takes their shoes off before they come in, okay?  There'd be no desks. You just sit on the floor.  - That's very-- - You've got a thai woman  out in the back-- Sockee.  - Okay. - Sockee.  - That's not-- - Sockee is her name, okay?  She's administering massage, all right, if you need it.  If you don't, whatever. Just talk to her.  She's a person.  Either way, 50 minutes of that,  and you  You are cracking to go.  - Is there a frontrunner? - You know what?  They all just sort of blend together after a while.  Well, there must be someone who stands out.  No, not at all.  In fact, I'm not even taking it seriously.  I think at the end of the day,  I'm just gonna pick a name out of the hat.  The hell you will!  I worked for the last boss for 15 years.  According to my doctor, I don't have another 15 years  if I wanna keep up the same dietary and sexual lifestyle,  which I intend to.  Oh, no, Stanley. You'll live forever.  My next boss will be my last boss.  He'll be at my funeral.  So I would appreciate it if you would take this seriously.  You pick a crappy boss,  you're responsible for my crappy life.  Okay, everybody. I was just making a joke.  I am taking it seriously. I promise.  Are you?  Little advice?  Take a day off from the whole Jim shtick.  Try caring about something.  You might like how it feels, James.  Hey, honey. Oh, lord. Take all this.  - All right. - Here.  - Oh. - Jim.  Did you hear stern this morning?  - No. Was he good? - AhRobin was good.  She's always good. Keeps him on his toes.  It's Howard's show, though.  Whose is this?  Darryl Philbin.  Oh. Very nice to see a familiar face on top.  Ah, a little long, aren't we? Four pages?  Is this the same Darryl Philbin  who's had two jobs in ten years at one company?  Yes, thanks to you who promoted me  after we, uhlnterfaced.  "Coordinated and implemented receipt, storage,  and delivery of over    Paper material, ma'am.  Paper material?  Pieces of paper.  Jo. May I speak to you for a second?  Or what? You gonna shoot me?  Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha  Oh, I enjoy laughing at my mistakes.  Because I've learned so much from them.  I'd like to be interviewed for the position.  I'll interview you right now.  - Okay. - Question one.  Ever shot a gun in the office?  It's complicated  Yeah, but seelt's not.  I don't think we should tell her.  Angela went a whole day without telling me  I had lettuce in my teeth. Screw her.  I'm a woman. I would want to know.  Yeah. You gotta know.  Okay. But if Angela can get a gay man to marry her,  maybe I could get a lesbian to marry me. Huh?  Huh? Huh? That's hot.  You have met a lesbian in real life, right?  You know, this probably is her last chance at a family.  She does seem happy.  You're right. You're right.  She seems happy. We don't tell her.  - We don't tell her. - Okay.  Excuse me, Ms. Bennett, may I have a word?  Okay.  UhCan it be in private?  Don't worry. It's not about you.  As minority executive,  I think it's my responsibility to let you know  that Gabe is gross.  I don't think it's professional  that he was sleeping with the receptionist,  and then when Erin dumped him so that she could be with Andy,  he became a total crazy stalker psycho.  Welcome to Scranton, Jo,  land of a thousand problems only you can fix.  Oh, for God's sake.  He's texting me his resume one line at a time.  These are costing me  I'm roaming!  Get me our biggest client on the phone  right this instant.  Who is our biggest client?  Uh, just put him through to me.  Okay.  Hello, this is The client.  It's Creed.  Fyi. I'm starting my own paper company.  Looking to poach some chumps. You in?  - Yes. - Cool!  Let's keep this on the qt, okay?  I, uh, don't want you to be a dead mammajamma.  - Great. - All right, thank you.  - Thank you. Bye-bye.  Jo, you have one more candidate.  He's a burn victim.  He's all messed up.  I can tell him to get lost if you want.  No. Send him in.  Who is this?  - I have no idea. - Oh, I know this guy.  Hello, Mr. Souvenier.  Mr. Jacques Souvenier?  Nice to meet you. It says here you're French?  So you worked at your last job for 15 years  as assistant to the regional manager.  Assistant regional manager.  Assistant to the regional manager.  - Assistant regional manager. - What is it?  Assistant regional manager.  Oh. That's my mistake. Sorry about that.  The last paper company you worked for  burned to the ground?  "All because they wouldn't hire a manager  who lived and breathed paper."  That's a travesty.  I wanna talk to Dwight Schrute for a second.  I wanna ask him a question.  Get Dwight.  If he isn't here in 60 seconds  Wait, wait! No. Stop, stop.  Jo  It's me. I'm Dwight.  No.  No. Wait. But--  I mean, you're Dwight and then  He's the--  Yeah.  Very unprofessional, Jacques.  Or should I say Dwight?  Let's just say I had hired this Jack Souvenier.  Then what?  I would have dressed this way every day,  legally changed my name, learned French sign language,  shown up, and been the best damn branch manager  you'd ever seen.  All that for this job.  Yes.  That's [Bleep] Crazy.  Get outta here.  What a nut job.  This guy was good, although he did keep saying  that he needed two weeks off right at the beginning  for a trip to the Finger Lakes.  Seriously, every five minutes he was like,  "hey, just making sure the Finger Lakes thing is clear."  Okay. It's fun to talk about the rejects,  but, uh Who's got ya excited?  Finger Lakes guy is good.  Darryl is also very good.  Who's this fellow? Went to Cornell.  What's wrong with him? How much time do you have?  Sales ability--none.  See sales ability.  And that's your unbiased opinion.  - Yes, it is. - So it's not relevant  that he took the receptionist away from ya.  Aw, Jo. Jo, I'm disappointed in you.  Some people let personal things into the work--  is she with him? Because I-I thought that--  - Gabe! Ohh!  You got all close to these people,  got involved in their lives.  Let's get ya back to Florida.  We'll figure out something for ya.  That sounds like a promotion.  It's not.  Let's get Kelly in here to take his place.  UmWhy Kelly?  'Cause Gabe's tall and weak. She's short and strong.  I'm doing an opposites thing.  Okay.  How'd my girl Nelly do?  Oh. I didn't know you knew her.  - She didn't mention it? - No.  Integrity move. I like it.  Yeah, uh, she also gave me reason to think  that maybe she wasn't a good fit.  Well, I'm not saying you must hire her.  If you find someone who's clearly a fit, then fine.  Just make sure they fit real good.  No more manager turnover. Don't mess this up, Jim.  And give Dwight an interview.  I like a little bit of crazy.  - Ah! - Erin, what are you doing?  I've been turned into a puppet.  Okay.  Look at the puppet. Hi, puppet.  Who are you?  I went to drop off the FedEx forms,  and an evil witch named Angela turned me into a puppet!  Yeah.  Low blow, puppet.  And there's only one thing that can change me back  into a real girl.  It's good.  It's just that I wish the puppet  would talk more about the alphabet.  Not for me, but  If any kids are watching.  A, b, and so forth.  You know.  M, N, L, O. P.  F.  I need the most special thing in the office.  Silence?  A date with the best salesman  Andy Bernard!  Hey, Erin. Oh.  Where'd you learn how to puppet like that?  - I've done it all my life-- - Listen, I'm really flattered,  but I don't think we should.  Erin's my best friend in this office,  hands down.  But  When she asked me out,  I just didn't have that feeling, you know?  Aren't there some things that you really want to like  but you just can't seem to like it?  Like madmen or football.  Let's not forget. Erin chose Gabe over me.  That happened.  I'm not gonna apologize for getting over herOkay?  I'm sorry.  I would go for someone who's more  She's great, though.  Stanley, I won't be able to invite  everyone to the wedding,  because we wanna keep it to 350.  - I'll get over it. - I mean,  we just have to see how many senators  and members of congress want to attend  before we can open it up to regular people.  Pam, you know how you and Jim did your ironic wedding?  Do you still have the plans  for the dream wedding that you couldn't afford?  That was our dream wedding.  Niagara falls?  Pregnant? That was your dream?  Pork medallions?  I hope  You have a very beautiful wedding, Angela.  All right.  Name. Dwight Schrute.  Thank you, Mr. Scnoot. We will let you know.  - You have to interview me. - I just did.  The answer to that one question  told me everything I need to know.  I demand more questions!  All right, guys. Good day.  A lot of candidates. Let's discuss.  Okay. If you're not gonna interview me,  then I'll do it. Yes.  What will be your first priority?  I will have seven first priorities.  Safety, profits,  fostering a community of self-reliance  and entrepreneurship,  listening,  respect for human life,  bolstering our public image,  and Getting everyone home on time.  Dwight, let me be Frank.  In an accident that no one can blame you for,  an antique gun was discharged while you were acting manager.  How are we ever to trust you again?  That's a great question.  I am going to institute  a strict no firearms policy for this office  that extends to myself as well.  Wow. All of my concerns are disappearing.  - Thank you, Dwight. - Thank you.  You'll be hearing from us shortly, Mr. Schrute,  and I think you're going to like the call  you're going to receive.  Oh, come on.  I'm just happy that I got this meeting.  Well, that was quick.  Very, very interesting.  And you know what? I'm impressed.  - He's not a real candidate. - I don't know, Jim,  'cause it makes me think about something  that my grandfather used to say, which is that  sometimes the hand that jumps out of the grave  and grabs you around the throat,  that is the hand that you want on the wheel.  - You took the deal. - Yeah. It was a great deal.  - That's not okay. - I don't know.  Dwight seems like a great leader to me,  and I look forward to the personal perks  that he promised me privately.  What do you think, Toby?  Well, we could try him out for a little while.  If it doesn't work out, you know,  maybe one of us could, you know, step in  What is happening right now?  Is it true that you're making Dwight the manager?  No. Why would you think that?  Well, he and Kelly said, then they pre-fired me.  Okay.  Okay, guys, just so you all know,  no decision has been made.  And Dwight is definitely not the boss.  That is correct.  Actually, Dwight is not the manager yet.  No, no, no, not-- Not ever, 'cause that's not gonna happen.  Well, it's not entirely up to you, is it?  Seems to me like someone is getting a little power mad.  Am I the only one who remembers  what he did when he was in charge?  I feel like I'm going a little bit crazy.  Tuna You're completely sane.  - Thank you. - Who do you like for the job?  Is there anyone who maybe  was a little underwhelming at first  but now seems like a safe  If not slightly unexciting choice?  Okay. It seems like everybody has an opinion, so who else?  Anybody? Do you mean it?  Anybody? Are you sure?  I suppose I am.  Okay. Well, what do I want in a manager?  Let me see.  What do I want?  I don't think he meant--  So now anyone gets to talk at any time?  Go ahead.  What do I want?  I'm looking for someone  who  Everyone is listening to me.  - Can I say-- - Yes.  I think it should be Darryl.  - Okay. - What a surprise.  Minorities sticking together. Kelly's on your side.  I'm sorry, is that all you think of me-- A minority?  I am so much more than that.  I am a dancer. I'm a singer.  I'm a fashion designer.  Whoever it is, I think they should be lame.  Kind of a nonthreatening, moderate personality.  - I want an outsider. - Perfect.  There are several outside candidates that we think--  No, I mean an outsider.  Like someone on the margins of society  who doesn't see things the way we do,  like a homeless person. A homeless person.  Really? A homeless person.  No. You're right, Pam.  Let's just leave them to the welfare system  and let that handle it. No, I want you to say  that you think the best person to be our new manager  is a homeless person.  Let me guess who you want, Pam.  Rachael ray? The ladies of the view?  I got away with everything under the last boss,  and it wasn't good for me at all.  So I want guidance. I want leadership.  But don't just like boss me around, you know?  Like lead me.  Lead me When I'm in the mood  to be led.  I just want for once  a small, professional, decisive,  well-hung man in his 40s.  - Hey, hey, hey! - Okay, fine.  Uh, the guy with a tiny penis.  Are you happy? Let's hire that guy!  She may have a point there.  Would a small penis work?  Small to moderate.  Gotta catch a plane.  Oh, hey, Gabe, I'm sorry.  We didn't get you a cake or anything.  We're gonna miss you.  Oh, well, I'm still the corporate liaison to the branch.  You are not leaving without giving me a hug.  Ugh! Okay, you know what?  You don't need to make that sound.  I'm sorry. You were just a lot bonier  than I thought you were gonna be!  There are plenty of people who love touching me.  I'm a terrific hugger.  I've been with a bunch of girls  where that's basically all they wanna do.  I will see you all soon. Later, man.  - Good luck. - We'll miss you.  Good luck at your new job.  Uh, listen up.  Listen up, ladies.  I want the job.  There. I said it.  I'm educated. I'm capable.  I like all of you, and I won't make any changes.  I see it.  I see it like I see a Mountain that I'm standing in front of  and facing and I'm liking.  Yeah.  Andy would be wonderful as boss.  Erin made a good point.  No. We're not related. I got the call.  But I'll tell her some other day.  What about Darryl?  We can all agree that he's a stand-up guy, right?  Well, let me be clear. I only speak for myself  and not myself and the senator.  I think we have some wonderful candidates,  and there is a great lively debate here.  But let's think about-- - No. No.  No. Sorry. We cut Kevin off for the same thing.  You have to have something to say if you talk.  Exactly.  Jada. No, no, no. Jada, what are you do--  Oh. So sorry, guys.  I hope my family didn't disrupt your meeting.  Daddy, are these the people who are making you manager?  Maybe, sweetheart.  Single dad. Challenges.  I don't know if he'd be a good manager,  but he's a really great dad.  Okay. Shush. This was a mistake.  Let's go.  It seems like we all know enough to vote.  Should just vote now? What? No, no, no.  It's not a vote. Then what was this all about?  I don't know.  This conversation really got away from me.  I don't care. They can just vote.  No, they can't.  That's not how this is gonna work.  We're going in this room.  We're gonna have a meeting.
