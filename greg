All right, Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. - How are things at the library? - I told you. I couldn't close it. So you've come to the master for guidance? Is this what you're saying, grasshopper? Actually, you called me in here, but, yeah. All right. Well, let me show you how it's done. I'd like to speak to your office manager, please. Yes, hello. This is Michael Scott. I am the Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products. Just wanted to talk to you manager-a-manager. All right. Done deal. Thank you very much, sir. You're a gentleman and a scholar. Oh, I'm sorry. OK. I'm sorry. My mistake. That was a woman I was talking to, so She had a very low voice. Probably a smoker, so So that's the way it's done. I've, er, I've been at Dunder Mifflin for 12 years, the last four as Regional Manager. If you want to come through here We have the entire floor. So this is my kingdom, as far as the eye can see. This is our receptionist, Pam. Pam! Pam-Pam! Pam Beasley. Pam has been with us for forever. Right, Pam? Well, I don't know. If you think she's cute now, you should have seen her a few years ago. - What? - Any messages? Er, yeah. Just a fax. Oh! Pam, this is from Corporate. How many times have I told you? There's a special filing cabinet. - You haven't told me. - It's called the wastepaper basket! Look at that. Look at that face. People say I am the best boss. They go, "We've never worked in a place like this. You're hilarious. "And you get the best out of us. " I think that pretty much sums it up. I found it at Spencer Gifts. Shall I play for you? Pa rum pum pum pum I have no gifts for you Pa rum pum pum pum My job is to speak to clients on the phone about er, quantities and type of copier paper. You know, whether we can supply it to them. Whether they can pay for it. And I'm boring myself just talking about this. - Whassup! - Whassup! I still love that after seven years. - Whassup! - Whassup! Whass up! Whassup. What? - Nothing. - OK. All right. - See you later. - All right. - Take care. - Back to work. Just before lunch. That would be great. Corporate doesn't interfere with me. Jan Levitson Gould. Jan, hello. I call her Hillary Rodham Clinton. Right? Not to her face, because Well, not because I'm scared of her. Cos I'm not. But, um Yeah. Was there anything you wanted to add to the agenda? Umm Me no get an agenda. - What? I'm sorry? - I didn't get any agenda. I faxed one to you this morning. Really? I didn't Did we get a fax this morning? Uh, yeah, the one Why isn't it in my hand? A company runs on efficiency of communication, right? So what's the problem, Pam? Why didn't I get it? You put it in the garbage can that was the special filing cabinet. Yeah, that was a joke. That was a joke that was actually my brother's, and It was for bills. It doesn't work with faxes. - Do you want to look at mine? - Lovely. Thank you. OK. Since the last meeting, Ellen and the board decided we can't justify a Scranton branch and a Stamford branch. - OK. - Don't panic. - No, this is good. This is fine. - Listen. Don't panic. - Alarm bells are ring-ding-ding! - We haven't decided. I've spoken to Josh in Stamford and told him the same. It's up to you to convince me your branch can incorporate the other. But it does mean there'll be downsizing. Me no wanna hear that, Jan. Because downsizing is a bitch. It is a real bitch. And I wouldn't wish that on Josh's men. I certainly wouldn't wish it on my men. Or women, present company excluded. Sorry. Er, is Josh concerned about downsizing himself? Not downsizing himself but downsizing? Question. How long do we have to Todd Packer, terrific rep. Do you mind if I take it? Go ahead. - Packman. - Hey, you big queen. - That's not appropriate. - Is old Godzillary coming in today? - I don't know what you mean. - I've been meaning to ask her. - Does the carpet match the drapes? - Oh, my God! Oh! That's horrifying. Horrible. Horrible person. So do you think we could keep a lid on this for now? - I don't want to worry people. - Absolutely. Under this regime, it will not leave this office. Like that. - So what does downsizing actually mean? - Well you guys better update your résumés like I'm doing. I bet it's gonna be me. Probably gonna be me. Yeah, it'll be you. I have an important question for you. Are you going to Angela's cat party on Sunday? Stop. That is ridiculous. Am I going to tell them? No. I don't see the point. As a doctor, you would not tell a patient if they had cancer. - Hey. - Hey. - This is Mr. Scott. - Guilty as charged! Ryan Howard from the temp agency. Daniqua sent me to start today. Howard, like Moe Howard. Three Stooges. Watch this. This is Moe. Nyuck-nyuck-nyuck-nyuck-nyuck. Mee! Right here. Three Stooges. High five. Oh, Pam. It's a guy thing, Pam. I'm sort of a student of comedy. Watch this. Here we go. I'm Hitler. Adolf Hitler. I don't think it would be the worst thing if they let me go because then I might I don't think it's many little girls' dream to be a receptionist. I like to do illustrations. Erm Mostly watercolor. A few oil pencil. Erm, Jim thinks they're good. Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam. Sure. Mr. Davis, let me call you right back. Something just came up. Two minutes. Thank you. - Dwight, what are you doing? - What? - Clearing my desk. - It's not on your desk. It's overlapping. It's spilling over the edge. One word, two syllables. Demarcation. - You can't do that. - Why not? Safety violation. I could fall and pierce an organ. We'll see. This is why the whole downsizing thing doesn't bother me. Downsizing? I have no problem with that. I have been recommending downsizing since I first got here. I even brought it up in my interview. I say, bring it on. You have messages from yesterday. Relax. Everything's under control. Er, Yeah. Yeah. That's important. Right. This is so important, I should run to answer it. - What? - Come on. Six Million Dollar Man. Steve Austin. Actually, that would be a good salary for me, don't you think? Six million dollars? Memo to Jan. I deserve a raise. - Don't we all? - I'm sorry? Nothing. If you're unhappy with your compensation, take it up with HR. Not today, OK? Pam, just be professional. I think I'm a role model. I think I garner people's respect. Attention all employees. We have a meeting in the conference room, ASAP. The people I respect, heroes of mine, would be Bob Hope Abraham Lincoln, definitely. Bono. And probably God would be the fourth one. And I just think all those people really helped the world in so many ways that it's really beyond words. It's really incalculable. I want to set the record straight. I'm Assistant Regional Manager. I should know first. - Assistant to the Regional Manager. - Can you tell me? Tell me quietly. Whisper in my ear. - I'm about to. - Can you tell us? - Please, OK? Do you want me to tell 'em? - You don't know what it is. You tell 'em. With my permission. Go ahead. Corporate has deemed it appropriate to enforce an ultimatum upon me. And Jan is thinking about downsizing either the Stamford branch or this branch. I heard they might be closing this branch down. That's just the rumor going around. This is my first day. I don't really know. - What if they downsize here? - Not gonna happen. - It'll be out of your hands. - It won't be, Stanley. I promise you that. - Can you promise that? - On his mother's grave. - What? - Well, yes, it is a promise. Frankly, I'm a little insulted that you have to keep asking about it. We need to know. I know. Hold on. I think Pam wanted to say something. Pam, you had a look that you wanted to ask a question just then. I was in the meeting with Jan. She did say this branch could get the axe. Are you sure about that? Well, maybe you should stick to the ongoing confidentiality agreement of meetings. Pam, information is power. You can't say for sure whether it'll be us or them, can you? No, Stanley. You did not see me in there with her. I said if Corporate wants to come in here and interfere, they're gonna have to go through me. You can mess with Josh's people, but I'm the head of this family and you ain't gonna be messing with my chillun. If I left, what would I do with all this useless information in my head? You know? Tonnage price of manila folders? Er, Pam's favorite flavor of yogurt, which is mixed berry. Jim said mixed berries? Well, yeah, he's on to me. Watch out for this guy. Dwight Shrute in the building. - This is Ryan, the new temp. - Introduce yourself. Be polite. Dwight Shrute, Assistant Regional Manager. Assistant to the Regional Manager. So, tell him about the kung fu and the car and everything. Er I've got a '78280Z. Bought it for - His profit. - New engine, suspension, respray. I've got some photos. Damn it! Jim! OK. Hold on. The judge is in session. What is the problem? He put my stuff in Jell-O again. Real professional. The third time. It wasn't funny the first two. It's OK here, but people sometimes take advantage because it's so relaxed. I'm a volunteer Sheriff's Deputy on the weekends. And you cannot screw around there. That's sort of one of the rules. - What is that? - That is my stapler. No. Do not take it out. Eat it out, because there are starving people in the world which I hate, and it is a waste of that kind of food. You can be a witness. Can you reprimand him? - How do you know it was me? - It's always you. - Are you going to discipline him? - Discipline. Kinky! Here's the deal, you guys. The thing about a practical joke is you have to know when to start as well as when to stop. And, yeah, Jim. Now is the time to stop putting Dwight's personal effects into Jell-O. OK. Dwight, I'm sorry, because I have always been your biggest flan. Nice. That's the way it is around here. - It goes round and round. - You should put him in custardy. Hey! Yes! New guy! He scores. That's great. I guess what I'm most concerned with is damage to company property. That's all. Pudding. Pudding I'm trying to think of another dessert to do. Do you like going out at the end of the week for a drink? - Yeah. - That's why we're all going out. For an end-of-the-week drink. - When are we going out? - Tonight, hopefully. - Hey, man. - What's going on? Hi, baby. Roy's my fiancé. We've been engaged about three years. We were supposed to get married in September but I think we're gonna get married in the spring. Do you mind if I go out for a drink with these guys? No. Come on. Let's get out of here and go home. OK. I'm gonna be a few minutes. It's only twenty past five. I still have to do my faxes. You know what? You should come with us. It could be a good chance to see what people are like outside the office. - I think it could be fun. - It sounds good. Seriously, we gotta get going. Yeah, yeah. Um What's in the bag? - Tell her I'll talk to her later. - Definitely. All right, dude. Will do. Do I think I'll be invited to the wedding? So have you felt the vibe yet? We work hard, we play hard. Sometimes we play hard when we should be working hard. I guess the atmosphere that I've created here is that I'm a friend first, a boss second and probably an entertainer third. Just a second. Right? Oh, do you like The Jamie Kennedy Experiment? Punk'd and all that kind of stuff? You are gonna be my accomplice. Just go along with it, OK? Just follow my lead. Don't pip me, all right? Come in. - Corporate just said - You got a fax. Thank you. Can you come in here for a sec? I was gonna call you in anyway. You know Ryan. As you know, there is going to be downsizing. And you have made my life so much easier in that I am going to have to let you go first. - What? Why? - Why? Well, theft and stealing. Stealing? What am I supposed to have stolen? Post-it Notes. Post-it Notes? What are those worth, 50 cents? If you steal a thousand Post-it Notes at 50 cents a piece, you know, you've made a profit margin. You're gonna run us out of business, Pam. Are you serious? - Yeah. I am. - I can't believe this. I have never even stolen as much as a paperclip and you're firing me. The best thing about it is we're not going to have to give you any severance pay. Because that is gross misconduct and Just clean out your desk. I'm sorry. You been X'd, punk! Surprise! It's a joke. We were joking around. See? OK. He was in on it. He was my accomplice. It was kind of a morale booster thing. We were showing the new guy around, giving him the feel of the place. So you God, we totally got you. You're a jerk. I don't know about that. What is the most important thing for a company? Is it the cash flow? Is it the inventory? Nuh-uh. It's the people. The people. My proudest moment here was not when I increased profits by 17% or when I cut expenses without losing a single employee. No, no, no, no, no. It was a young Guatemalan guy. First job in the country, barely spoke English. He came to me, and said, "Mr. Scott, would you be the godfather of my child?" Wow. Wow. Didn't work out. We had to let him go. He sucked. - Hey. - Hey. How are you? I thought you were going for a drink with No. I just decided not to. - How's your headache? - It's better, thanks. - Good. That's great. - Is? - Yeah? - Um Are you - Am I walking out? - Yes. - Yes, I Do you want to - Yeah. Great. Let me just Oh, boy. - Listen, have a nice weekend. - Definitely. You too. Enjoy it. You know what, just come here. Happy Halloween, everyone! Oh, that's great. Hey. Happy Halloween. Jan called. (SIGHS) Okay. I know why she's calling. It's the end of the month, and I was supposed to let somebody go by the end of the month. (SIGHS) And somehow I'm supposed to put on a costume and smile. (TELEPHONE RINGING) Okay. SHERRY: Jan Levinson's office. Hey, Sherry, Michael Scott returning. Oh, she's in a meeting. She just wanted the name of the employee you let go. Well, I'm gonna wait until the end of the day, because the book said it's best to wait until the end of the day. I just need the name of who you're planning to let go. I don't know yet. I will have to call her back. I know she wanted the name. Okay, Sherry? Yeah. If you were getting fired, how would you wanna be told so that you could still be friends with the person firing you? Jan wants the name as soon as possible, Michael. Thanks. I'll call her back. I wish I could fire Sherry. Hey, I'm still here. Okay. I'm sorry. Yeah. No. Okay. Bye. Hanging up now. I mean, you hear about layoffs in the news, but when you actually have to do it yourself, it is heavy stuff. It's I mean, these are people's lives you're talking about. You wanted me? Yes. Papier-mache? Yes. Yes. Um Pam, I have to let somebody go today. This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do. Why did you put it off until Halloween? Because it's very scary stuff. I think it's gonna put a damper on the party a little. You're worried about the party? There's a man's life at stake here. So it's a man? No. Or woman. A human life. If you had to guess who it would be based on their job performance and who you think deserves to be fired, who would that be? I just answer the phone. And sometimes you just let it go to voicemail. Your costume is fantastic. I know. I sent away for it in July from a catalog. PAM: Oh, no. Don't, don't, don't, don't. (SCREECHING) Okay. Oh, man. Okay, I have to fire somebody. What is that? What are you supposed to be? I'm the three-hole punch version of Jim, 'cause you can have me either way, plain white Jim or three-hole punch. That's great. I like it. JIM: Oh? Yeah. Yeah, well, look. What about me? (HISSING) What are What are you? A monk? I'm a Sith lord. Oh, big deal. Three round pieces of paper taped to a shirt. This cost me $129. Ass. Hey, you guys excited about the party? It's gonna be fun. Yeah. Yes. Oh, and look at you. Showing your colors. Don't you wish you wore a dress every day. What are you implying? All good. Happy Halloween. What happened to all of those spooky decorations that we had, the cobwebs and such? Yeah, I don't know. We put them all up last night. (SIGHS) Well, you know what? Go buy some more. I'll approve the overages. Sound good? Yeah. Good. Oh, yeah, also, about budget stuff Um I'm gonna need you to find, like, a full employee salary plus benefits. Like 50 grand. I'm gonna need you to find 50 grand in the numbers. But we don't keep two sets of books. Well, that's not what I'm saying. Just, you know, find it. Pretend that your jobs depend on it. (LAUGHS) Interesting take on Dorothy. I love it. Hey, you know what would even be better? A soccer ball and cleats. Why is that? Bend It Like Beckham. Oh, like the movie about the Indian girl who plays soccer? Yeah, that would be perfect. Yeah, I mean, I guess I could do that. It'd be funny. I don't really play soccer or anything. Well, I don't really have two heads. So Wait, what are you again? Oh, right. Three-hole punch! Okay, greatest strength. Okay, okay. A dog-like obedience to authority. Nice. But that doesn't sound good. Okay, okay. How about the ultimate team player? Dwight is special. But I don't believe that his talents are being used in this office. So Pam and I have put his resume on Monster. Com, Google, Craig's List. We're really interested most in jobs that take Dwight out of state. Preferably Alaska or India. (WHISPERING) He's a gun nut. (GRUNTING) (WHISPERING) Sticks to his guns. Well, I looked through all the budgets and there is one department Yes. that has three people Yeah. doing the work that could be done by two. This is great. Oh. Yeah. Oh. Who do you think it should be? Jim, definitely. No, Jim brings in money. Phyllis? No. Stanley, Pam, Oscar, Meredith, Kevin, Angela. It's not a popularity contest. Although it does make sense to fire the least popular because that has the least effect on morale. One of the warehouse guys. What? There is someone left off that list? Who? Who is he saying? (GASPS) You're right. I didn't even think of him. No, Michael. Yeah, that's actually a really good idea. No. No. Not me. Yeah, I could. Not Dwight. I'm not saying that's what he said. I know that's what he said. What? Tell him not Dwight. That is not a very nice thing to say about him. Tell him to stop. Are you kidding? Quiet, you! I agree. He'd land on his feet. Make him be quiet. Those aren't chips and dip. No, I made brownies. (EXCLAIMS) What? I'm just trying to figure out why you're sabotaging things. I made brownies. And I made cookies. Same category. (SIGHS) I'm guessing Angela's the one in the neighborhood who gives the trick-or-treaters some toothbrushes, pennies, walnuts Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Yeah. Just one second. I will transfer you to our manager, Michael Scott. (TELEPHONE RINGS) Wow. Michael Scott here. Yes, I am regional manager of this orifice. Hmm-hmm. Dwight Schrute is amazing. Yeah. No, he is actually the single greatest employee of his generation. Hmm-hmm. You know what? I'm gonna tell you what. You hire Dwight K. Schrute and he does not meet, nay, exceed every one of your wildest expectations, well, then, you can hold me, Michael Gary Scott personally and financially responsible. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Stanley, could you come with me, please? No. As Assistant Regional Manager To the? Look, I've got some bad news. You're fired. You need to pack up your things and go. I'm serious, Stanley. It's over. I'm sorry. "You're fired." Get your fingers off my phone. So, how did it go with Stanley? How did he take it? He wouldn't listen to me. Oh, come on. If you wanna fire him, you're gonna have to tell him yourself. I don't wanna fire Stanley. I never said that. I'm certainly not going to do it myself. Get those big baleful eyes staring at me. Yikes. Just Okay, just Cumberland Mills? And how did you get my resume? Oh, no, no. I'm very flattered. Don't get me wrong. I'm just not sure that it's my official resume or if it's something that maybe a satisfied customer posted online. What does it say under martial arts training? Oh, okay, I'm gonna have to supplement that. Could I have your fax number? Would I ever leave this company? Look, I'm all about loyalty. In fact, I feel like part of what I'm getting paid for here is my loyalty. But if there were somewhere else that valued that loyalty more highly, I'm going wherever they value loyalty the most. Oh, hey. Oh, your dress is stuck in the back. Gotta just Oh. So you got the fax. So why didn't you add it to the resume? What do you mean? Of course, martial arts training is relevant. Oh, excuse me, I know about a billion Asians that would beg to differ. Yeah, I get a little frustrated when I'm dealing with incompetence! Well, you know what? You can go to hell, too, and I will see you there burning. Fine. Oh, wait, so you'll let me know when you've made a decision Jim is really talented. And he should be the one who's getting a better job offer. Like, for real. Don't take this the wrong way, but you should go for that job. Um It's in Maryland. Yeah. But, I mean, look at the salary, and it's definitely a step up and a challenge. Yeah. Yeah. You know what, maybe Maybe I will. Jim. This is called leveraging an offer. Michael, can I talk to you for a moment? Oh, God. I just thought you should know that I was just offered a job with better pay, better benefits, and a better title at Cumberland Mills. Fantastic. And I turned it down. What? That would have solved all my problems. Out of loyalty to this company. Oh, you idiot. Go. So I was hoping to be made Assistant Regional Manager officially. If you left, I wouldn't have to fire anybody. But then you wouldn't have me here. Big deal. Oh, it would have worked out so well. Can you get it back? It's in Maryland. You could call. Can you call them? I can't I suppose I No. (YELLING) They never really made me an offer anyway. Why are you torturing me? God. Honestly, I don't think Michael has the slightest clue of who he's gonna fire. I think he keeps hoping that someone's gonna volunteer, or be run over by a bus before the deadline. But in the end, really, what's gonna happen is it's gonna be the first person to give him a dirty look in the hall. And therein lies the true essence of his charisma. (MICHAEL CLEARS THROAT) Can I speak to you a minute? Yes. Michael, I really didn't mean to Help me. I'm sorry? I want you to role-play firing me. I want you to fire me, and I will take it. Oh, you want me to be you. Yes. Okay. I want you to be me and I will be Creed. Oh, are you firing Creed? No, no, no. That's just first thing Came Can't That head We should switch seats in order to Yes, that's a good idea. All right? Excuse me. (CLEARS THROAT) I'm really sorry, but I have to let you go. And it's purely budgetary. It's not personal (SCREAMING) I'm gonna kill myself! Wow. I'm going to kill myself and it's your fault! That's an overreaction. Corporate is really breathing down my neck and they're saying this has to be done by the end of the month Is this you? Are you being you? Or is this Creed? Are you I am This is Creed. Okay. I'm improvising. So just try to keep up. And I'm very angry. Hold that thought. And I want I'm gonna kill you. Michael Scott here. I'm gonna kill you for firing me. Toby. I really have to take this, Creed, so it was really a pleasure working with you, okay? Get off. Get off. No, no. Just get up. Just, just Yeah. (SIGHS) What happened? It wasn't me. Oh, that was, like, crazy, because I was Yeah, I know. Hey, Creed? Could I talk to you for a second? You are great and very ambitious, and I feel like you want more than this little office has to offer. And I understand that you'd want to just spread your wings and fly the coop. What are you telling me? We're gonna have to You want something better. No, I don't. I wanna stay right here. No, you wanna leave. No, I wanna stay here. Now, why are you making this so hard? I think there's a misunderstanding about this. I think you're right. Can I go? No, of course you can't go! We haven't even started this horrible process of Okay, Creed. I need to let somebody go today. They told me I need to let somebody go. And as much as I think you're a great guy, and I like you, you're Goodbye. Let's fight it. Let's call Jan and fight this thing together like the old days. What old days? What are you talking about? Did you start the paperwork yet? It's right here on the desk, yeah. You don't have to do this, Michael. I can't, though. Undo it! I can't change anything. This is the way it No. You have the power to undo it. I don't. Okay, just let's not You can undo it. Michael, undo it! Yeah, I went hunting once. Shot the deer in the leg. Had to kill it with a shovel, took about an hour. Why do you ask? I have to fire someone today. Okay? Fine. Fire someone else. Fire Devon. He's terrible. I am so much better at my job than Devon. Okay, well, I already picked you and you know that, so, unless I just go through with this, you're always gonna look at me as the guy who almost fired you. No, no, no, no, no, no. I will forget so fast. You will be my savior. You're the guy who gave me my life back. Thank you. I knew you'd see it my way, Michael. God bless you. You're a fine man. Don't Listen, you will not regret this, either. Devon is terrible. No one's gonna miss him. Good, good, good, good. (DOOR OPENS) Devon, could I talk to you for a second? Creed's an idiot. You know that. Well, he No, no, no, no, no, no. You had it right the first time! Well, maybe I did. Exactly, you gotta go with your gut, man. (SIGHS) No, I can't No, I can't go back. I would look like an idiot. That's why I'm being fired? No. So you might not look like an idiot? No, it was all the stuff that I said. It was the business downturn and cutbacks, and You God, this is unbelievable! I just hope that you and I can remain friends. Devon, wait. Please. What? Look, look. In addition to severance and everything, I want to give you this gift certificate to Chili's from me. Okay? No hard feelings. Kevin, Jim, Pam, Kelly, Toby, Oscar, Meredith, Phyllis, Stanley, or the temp. If any of you wanna meet me for a drink, I'm gonna be at Poor Richard's. And the rest of you can go to hell. (DOOR SLAMS) What about the Halloween party? Oh, hey, Jim. Wait, stop. I'm sorry for pushing you toward Cumberland. Seriously, if you left here, I would blow my brains out. Come on. JIM: That's just a figure of speech, you know. Blow your brains out? Come on. All it really means is that we're friends. And who else is she gonna talk to if I'm gone? Right? I mean, if she left, I wouldn't blow my brains out. Of course, I would take that job in Maryland because it's double the pay and soft-shell crab just happens to be my favorite food. MICHAEL: I love Halloween. You know, it's just But it's just fun. Every year, it's just fun. Last Halloween, I came as Janet Jackson's boob. (MICHAEL LAUGHS) It was topical. People got a big kick out of it. The year before that I came as Monica Lewinsky, and I wore a stained dress. The year before that, I also came as Monica Lewinsky, and before that I was O.J. It was pretty funny. Oh, I wish you were here last year. (DOORBELL RINGS) KIDS: Trick-or-treat! Hey. How you doing? Wow, you guys look great! I'm a bumble bee. You look great. And you're a princess? A fairy princess. A fairy princess. You're very I'm a lion! You're a lion. Wow. I wanna hear your Oh! Okay, that's all yours. That's all yours. Okay! Grab it. Grab it. You know what? You guys are getting all of these. Hey. Hello. Jim! What's up, buddy? This is not funny. Why is my stuff in here? JIM: That's weird. A dollar for a stapler, that's pretty good. Yeah, well, I'm not paying for my own stuff, okay? I know you did this, 'cause you're friends with the vending machine guy. Who, Steve? Yeah, Steve. Whatever his name is. What do I want? What do I want? (EXCLAIMS) It's a pencil cup. Oh, no, no, no. That's my pencil cup. I don't think so, I just bought it. I think so, and you're gonna hand it over to me. I love these. Okay, fine. Where's my wallet? There it is. J1. Here, you know what? I don't have any I've got some nickels. $0.05, $0.10, $0.15, $0.20, $0.25 Hello, everyone. Good morning, Michael. Where are we going this afternoon? (EXCLAIMING) Last week, Michael sent out this mysterious memo. "It's time for our first-quarter camaraderie event. "So pack a swimsuit, a toothbrush, rubber-soled shoes and a ski mask." A ski mask and a swimsuit. So that he can have us rob a bank and then escape through the sewers. And brush our teeth. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Yeah. Michael. Stanley, bo-banley. I need to know Banana-fana-fo-fanley. what we're doing. Me, my, mo, manly. You said bring a toothbrush. Stanley. Is this an overnight? Maybe. The suspense is just so exciting, isn't it? Should my wife tell her boss she's not coming in tomorrow? Maybe. I don't know. Not maybe. Yes or no? Well, no, but Okay, don't spoil it for everybody, all right? But we are going on a booze cruise on Lake Wallenpaupack. In January? It's cheaper. This is not just another party. This is a leadership training exercise. Right? I'm going to combine elements of fun and motivation and education into a single mind-blowing experience. It is now time to unveil the destination of this year's retreat. We are going on a harbor cruise of Lake Wallenpaupack. Yes! It's a booze cruise. All right! I have a test for business school tomorrow night. Is it okay if I skip the cruise and study for that? No, this is mandatory. But don't worry. You know what? You're gonna learn plenty. This is gonna turn your life around, Ryan. I'm already in business school. Well, this KELLY: Wait, Michael. Yeah? Why did you tell us to bring a bathing suit? To throw you off the scent. Yeah, but I bought a bathing suit. Well, just keep the tags on and you can return it. I took the tags off already. Well, that's not my fault, okay? Just We're not gonna pay for a bathing suit. Okay, I know what you're all thinking. "Who is this smart little cookie?" Her name is Brenda something, and she is from Corporate. And she is here, like you, to learn from what I have to say. I am a great motivational speaker. I attended a Tony Robbins event by the airport last year and It wasn't the actual course. You have to pay for the actual course. But it talked about the actual course. And I've incorporated a lot of his ideas into my own course. Leader ship. The word "ship" is hidden inside the word "leadership" as its derivation. So if this office is in fact a ship, as its leader, I am the captain. But we're all in the same boat. Teamwork! Last year, Michael's theme was "Bowl over the competition." So guess where we went. Now, on this ship that is the office, what is the sales department? Anyone? How about the sales department is the sails? Yes, Darryl, the sales department makes sales. Good. Let me just explain. I see the sales department as the furnace. A furnace? How old is this ship? How about the anchor? PHYLLIS: What does the furnace do? All right, let's not get hung up on the furnace. It's just It's the sales I see the sales department are down there. They're in the engine room, and they're shoveling coal into the furnace. Right? I mean, who saw the movie Titanic? They were very important in the movie Titanic. Who saw it? Show of hands. Not really sure what movie you're talking about. Are you sure you got the title right? Titanic. I think you're thinking of The Hunt for Red October. No! I'm Leo DiCaprio! Come on! Michael stands in the front of the boat and says that he's king of the world within the first hour, or I give you my next paycheck. Michael, everyone in the engine room drowned. No. Thank you, spoiler alert. You saw the movie, those of you who did. You They're happy down there in the furnace room. And they're dirty and grimy and sweaty. And they're singing their ethnic songs and Actually, that might be warehouse. What? The No, no No, I didn't Okay. Well, the Okay, in a nutshell, what I'm saying is "leadership." We'll talk more about that on the boat. Ship. Aye-aye, Captain. (MICHAEL SINGING) A three hour tour A three hour tour MICHAEL: Pam, you are Mary Ann. We have the Professor and Ginger. Welcome aboard! Angela, you are Mrs. Howell, Lovey. The native. Sometimes they come from neighboring We have one of the Globetrotters. I am the Skipper, and, Dwight, you will be Gilligan! Cool! Actually, I'm the skipper. Okay. But you could be Gilligan. No! I'd rather die. Hi. I am Michael Scott. I am the captain of this party. (EXCLAIMS) I'm Captain Jack. I'm captain of the ship. I'm also captain of anyone who sets foot on this ship. Hi, welcome aboard. Okay. In an office, when you are ranking people, manager is higher than captain. On a boat, who knows? It's nebulous. Hey, look! I'm king of the world! (MICHAEL WHOOPING) (DWIGHT WHOOPING) (CAPTAIN JACK CLAPPING) CAPTAIN JACK: Okay, all right! Welcome aboard! I am your captain, Captain Jack. And I am the Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin, Michael Scott. Welcome, welcome! Okay, so Okay, so Please. The life preservers Right. they are located underneath the seats all along the perimeter of the boat. Don't worry, you are not gonna be needing life preservers tonight. Well, we might be. It's just gonna be Please let me finish. Okay? Thank you. Well So the Coast Guard requires that I tell you where the safety exits are. Now, on this ship, it's very easy. Anywhere over the side. (LAUGHING) Not only am I your ship's captain, I am also your party captain! (WHOOPING) We're gonna get it going here in just a few minutes. And I'm your party captain, too! And you are gonna put on your dancing shoes later on! Hey, Mike, Mike, Mike. So we are gonna If you don't mind rock it! What? Please! Okay? If the boat's rocking, don't come knocking! Michael. Yeah? Your company employees are not the only people on the boat tonight. Okay? We're all gonna have a good time tonight. Hey, listen, listen, Mike. Why don't you let me and my crew do our job? You just sit back and have a good time. Okay. Yep. So All right? You guys, it's like we're in high school and we're at the cool table. (LAUGHING) Right? Yeah. Pam, were you a cheerleader? No, she was total "Miss Artsy-Fartsy" in high school. She wore the turtleneck and everything. That's hilarious. It's not hilarious Where did you go to school? Bishop O'Hare. His-slop-who-cares-a? We played you! You really look familiar. Did you You cheered for them, didn't you? No. Yes, I did. (SINGING) A-W-E-S-O-M-E Awesome, awesome is what we are We're the football superstars! A-W-E-S-O-M-E ROY: I remember that, and we crushed you, like, 42-10. Having fun? Yeah. Everybody's really nice. Good, well, that is what Scranton is all about. Not like you New Yorkers! So When are you gonna start the presentation? I already sort of started it back at the office and on the dock with the Gilligan thing. So, right now, I was thinking. Yes, okay! Listen up, all you Dunder Mifflinites! I would like to talk to you all about life preservers. Now, one important life preserver in business is IT support. Not now, Mike, we're doing the limbo! That's right, partiers, it's time to limbo, limbo, limbo! (DWIGHT WHOOPING) So, okay. All right, I need a volunteer to come up here and hold my stick! Who's it gonna be? Okay. Me, me, me. Usually it's a woman. I'm stronger. Hey, I got an idea. How would you like to steer the ship, Dwight? Keep us on a steady course. Keep a sharp eye out. I'm counting on you. I was the youngest pilot in Pan Am history. When I was four, the pilot let me ride in the cockpit and fly the plane with him. And I was four and I was great. And I would have landed it, but my dad wanted us to go back to our seats. (BAND PLAYING PEPPY MUSIC) (PEOPLE CHEERING) All right, all right, that was great! Now it's time for the dance contest! Why don't we do that after I do my presentation? Nope. Dance contest! All right, we'll have a motivational dance contest! Hit it! (BAND PLAYING DANCE MUSIC) Yeah! Okay! Dancing! It is a primal art form used in ancient times to express yourself with the body! And communicate! Sometimes you have to take a break from being the kind of boss that's always trying to teach people things. Sometimes you have to just be the boss dancing. (SINGING) What do you do with a drunken sailor? What do you do with a drunken sailor? What do you do with a drunken sailor Early in the morning? Come inside and talk to me. I can't. Do you want us to run aground, woman? Snorkel shot! Snorkel shot! Snorkel shot! Snorkel shot! Snorkel shot! Yeah! Who's next? Come on! Pammy, come on! Come on! No, I'm not doing that. Come on! (ALL CHATTERING) Hey, why don't we find, like, a quieter place to hang out? No, I just gotta wait for Darryl to do his shot. Just a minute. Come on. Darryl! Darryl! It's getting kind of rowdy down there. Yeah. (LAUGHING) "Darryl, Darryl, Darryl!" Sometimes I just don't get Roy. I mean, I don't know. So What's it like dating a cheerleader? (PAM CHUCKLING) I'm cold. So, what's this presentation all about? See? This is of general interest. It is about priorities and making decisions, using the boat as an analogy. What is important to you? If the boat is sinking, what do you save? Women and children. No, no, salesmen and profit centers. That's a stupid analogy. Okay. Well, obviously you don't know anything about leadership. Well, I was the captain of a PC-1 Cyclone coastal patrol boat during Desert Storm. Wow, you should be the motivational speaker. Him? Okay. Yeah, he gives me real responsibility, Michael. Captain Jack delegates. He's let me steer the ship for the last hour. I'd like to be engaged. How did you manage to pull that off? (LAUGHS) I've been engaged for three years, and there's no end in sight. So you don't want to ask my advice. Suppose your office building's on fire, Jim, who would you save? Let's see The customer, because the customer is king. Not what I was looking for, but a good thought. He's just sucking up. When you were in the Navy, did you ever almost die? Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, and I wasn't thinking about some customer. I was thinking about my first wife. The day I got back on shore, I married her. You know what? I would save the receptionist. I just wanted to clear that up. ROY: Everybody, could I get your attention for just a second? Can you listen to me for a second? We were up at the front, and we were talking about what's really important and Pam, I think enough is enough. I think we should set a date for our wedding. (ALL CHEERING) How about June 10th? Come on, let's do it! Come on, baby! MAN 1: Yeah! Congratulations! Congratulations! MAN 2: Yeah! Yeah! Oh, my God! I love you, baby! Congratulations! (PEOPLE CHEERING) You know what, I don't want to take credit for this, but Roy and I were just having a conversation about making commitments and making choices. Right? Did I motivate you? No, it's Captain Jack. Well Captain Jack. Could have been either one of us, because we pretty much were saying the same thing. Congratulations! That is great! We gotta celebrate! ALL: Yeah! (SCREAMING) CAPTAIN JACK: Hey, hey, hey! I got an idea, I got an idea. I could marry you right now as captain of the ship. MAN: Yes! I could marry you as Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin! No, no, no. I want my mom and dad to be there. Then I'll give you away! No, thank you. (BAND PLAYING SOFT MUSIC) Do you think that'll ever be us? No. What is wrong with you? Why did you even bring me here tonight? I don't know. Let's break up. What? This is where old Captain Jack drives the boat. Wow! (MEREDITH LAUGHS) Seasick? Captain Jack says you should look at the moon. Captain Jack's a fart-face. (RETCHING) I'm on medication. Really? What? Vomacillin. (CLEARING THROAT) Okay, all right. It's time to be boss. Time to motivate. Let's blow some minds here. Okay, guys, guys, guys. Cool it. Everybody? Dunder Mifflin Scranton employees, Brenda, I've some very, very urgent news I need to tell everybody. Right now. Listen up. The ship is sinking. Okay? We're going down right now. Just wrap your heads around the reality of that. Please! Everybody, it's my turn now, okay? Captain Jack is gone. In five minutes, this ship is going to be at the bottom of the lake, and there aren't enough spaces on the lifeboat. Who are we gonna save? Do we save sales? Do we save customer service? Do we save accounting? This is a business scenario. Right? It's a scary It's a predicament. Hey! What the hell is going on here? And it's something that each and every one of us have to think about. I'm in the brig. See? The boat's not as corporate-friendly as advertised. What is the deal with the guy jumping overboard? What was If he had just waited and heard what I had to say, he would be motivated right now, and not all wet. (SIGHING) Is somebody there? What happened to you? (SIGHING) Captain Jack has a problem with authority. Right, 'cause you announced that his ship was sinking? Yeah. He just totally lost it. If you ask me, he caused the panic. What a night. Well, it's nice for you. Your friend got engaged. She was always engaged. Roy said the first one didn't count. That's great. You know, to tell you the truth, I used to have a big thing for Pam. So Really? You're kidding me. You and Pam? Wow! I would have never put you two together. You really hid it well. God! I usually have a radar for stuff like that. You know I made out with Jan. Yeah, I know. Yeah, yeah. Well, Pam is cute. Yeah. She's really funny, and she's warm, and she's just Anyway. Well, if you like her so much, don't give up. She's engaged. BFD. Engaged ain't married. Never, ever, ever give up. DWIGHT: Don't worry, Michael. I'm taking us to shore. It's a fake wheel, dummy. So have you found a band yet for your wedding? No. 'Cause I'm in a band. We really rock. Yeah. I mean, it's inevitable. I definitely overhear some wedding preparation, but I'm fine with it. She hears me arranging my social life. And we both have to hear Dwight order deer urine over the Internet. So it evens out. Oh, I got the Save-the-Date. Yeah? Yeah. Pretty stationery. Oh, thanks. ANGELA: I didn't get mine yet. Oh. There are a few people I decided not to invite, and that might make things kind of awkward, but it's my wedding. And I don't want anyone there who has called me a hussy. Yes, thanks. Fantastic Sams, Adult Cut Plus. Comes with a shampoo and blow-dry. We're doing ID photos today. Gotta represent. On or off? Off. Okay. Oh, what is on your face? Is that a disguise? Excuse me. Clown paint. ID badges are long overdue. Security in this office park is a joke. Last year, I came to work with my spud gun in a duffel bag. I sat at my desk all day with a rifle that shoots potatoes at 60 pounds per square inch. Can you imagine if I was deranged? MICHAEL: That's a nice tie. Thank you. That is Who makes that? I don't know. Do you mind if I wear that for the photo? Let's Let's keep our clothes. OSCAR: It's like child abuse! I say, if Jesus saw that, he'd freak out! He'd freak out, Toby! I mean, on so many levels! And I'm supposed to work there? I'm supposed to What's the dealio? Just letting Oscar vent a little. We would use the break room, but the photographer's back there. What's the problem? Angela. There's just a little dispute over a poster in their workspace. Since Christmas. So, what, you're having a little spat? I forget, are you guys dating? No. Michael, can I talk to you for a second, please? Yes. Here's how I usually handle this. All I do is listen, you know? These things just have a way of working themselves out. It's like if you write someone a letter when you're really angry, they say to keep it in a drawer for a couple of days and then you just never end up sending it. What do you know about conflict resolution? Your answer to everything is to get divorced. So Okay. Okay, what? That was the right decision for me and my marriage. Yeah. Well, that's not gonna fly here, because in this office it is till death do us part. Assuming that we don't get downsized. Pam, would you get Angela and meet us in the conference room, please? A "Mediators Toolchest." Okay. Well, before we get started, you should know that there are five different styles of conflict. (IN MOCK ASIAN ACCENT) My Shaolin temple style defeats your monkey style. Can we go? I have a lot of work to do. No. This is important. Okay. The first style is lose-Iose. What's the next one? Just hold on, please. Okay. If we do lose-Iose, neither of you gets what you want. Do you understand? You would both lose. Now, I need to ask you, do you want to pursue a lose-Iose negotiation? Can we just skip to whatever number five is, win-win or whatever. Win-win is number four. And number five is win-win-win. The important difference here is with win-win-win, we all win. Me, too. I win for having successfully mediated a conflict at work. Okay. So this is the disputed poster. Now, one at a time, I want you to express your feelings, using "l" emotion language, and no judging or "you" statements. I got this poster for Christmas and I feel I want to see it every day. It makes me feel like the babies are the true artists, and God has a really cute sense of humor. Come on. Seriously, that? I don't like looking at it. It's creepy and in bad taste, and it's just offensive to me. It makes me think of the horrible, frigid stage mothers who forced the babies into it. It's kitsch. It's the opposite of art. It destroys art, it destroys souls. This is so much more offensive to me than hard-core porn. Okay, okay, okay. Stop. Stop. Stop. Let's see if we can't just brainstorm and find some creative alternatives that are win-win. Win. Yes. Thank you, Pam. How about Angela makes the poster into a t-shirt, which Oscar wears. That way he can never see it and whenever she looks at Oscar, she can see it. Win-win-win. No. That's No. Okay. Well, brainstorm. Own the solution. How about I leave it up? How about she takes it down? How about Angela can keep it up on Tuesdays and Thursdays? Okay. That is called a compromise. And it is style three, and it is not ideal. To sum up, win-win: Make the poster into a t-shirt. Win-Iose: Take the poster down. Compromise: Tuesdays and Thursdays. And the answer is make the poster into a t-shirt. Win-win. Win. Fine. But It is done. No, you're all good. Great. PAM: Hey, Angela. I didn't have your zip code. Oh. Thanks. It was hand-delivered. But I did get a Save-the-Date after all. It's not my taste. You solved it? Yes. Well, good. We can throw that one out. Are those all the other complaints? Mmm-hmm. I would like to see those, please. I can't do that. You can't do that, huh? Okay. Now you and I have a conflict. I order you to give me that file. That Okay. There. No more conflict. I had to use win-Iose on that. It was not pretty. All right. Is that it? It's all Dwight's. Every Friday at 4:00 I have a standing appointment with Dwight for him to file a grievance against Jim. I tell him that I'm sending them to a special file in New York. That box is the special file in New York. Oh, God. All right. Why do I have to do everything? PHOTOGRAPHER: Are you sure? Oh, he's sure. Just shoot. This is from Kevin. He says Stanley uses his Miracle Whip without asking. Meredith complains that everyone talks too loud in the morning and the lights are too bright. Creed (MUTTERING) Creed is sick of looking at the redhead all day, and wants a seat facing the receptionist. Nice. You will notice that not one of these complaints is against me. Actually, I have a separate folder for complaints against Michael. This is January through March of this year. How many of you have, at one time, gone to Toby to complain about another employee? And did you get what you wanted? Or were you merely listened to, you forget about your problem and you move on? ALL: (MUMBLING) Merely listened to and forgotten. That is outrageous. I love this place, and it pains me to see all of the negativity festering. Okay. Today we are going to get everything out of these files and into the open where it can be resolved. All right. How about the Phyllis-Angela dispute. You already did me. MICHAEL: That's what she said. The thing is, Angela, you are in here an awful lot. You have complained about everybody in the office, except Dwight, which is odd because everyone else has had run-ins with Dwight. Toby, by the way, what does "redacted" mean? There is a file full of complaints in here marked "redacted"? Yeah. It just means whoever complained came to me later and withdrew it. So, I just took their name off. Okay. There were a bunch of complaints about Dwight that were put in the redacted file about six months ago. Wait. If someone has a problem with me, why would they withdraw it six months ago? Let's move on. I volunteer. Did anyone have a problem with me? All right. Pamela! Come on down! Let's do it. And Okay. Just one complaint. Actually, it has been withdrawn. So that is no help to us. Next! Wait. What did it say? "Does she have to plan her wedding on office time?" "Shouldn't she do that at home?" MICHAEL: Who else? Why don't we just warm up first? Warm up emotionally. All right? PAM: I have this kind of big secret about Angela. And I've been really nice to her, and I haven't told anyone, and What the hell! Here is a Kelly complaint. "Ryan never returns my calls." Join the club. My voicemail's real spotty sometimes. I didn't file a complaint. I was just talking. To your HR representative. To my friend, I thought. I want that withdrawn. Fine. I'll take your name off so no one will know. Making progress. Yes? Dwight tried to kiss me. DWIGHT: What? And I didn't tell anyone 'cause I'm not really sure how I feel about it. That is not true. Redact it. Redact it. Well, I'm not actually making a formal complaint. I just really think we should talk about it. Okay. Question. When a name is withdrawn, does that also apply to the permanent misbehavior file in New York? Sure. MICHAEL: Stanley, you got a lot of anger under there, buddy Hey, thanks for ratting me out. I didn't do it. I find that hard to believe, considering you have problems with every single person in this entire office except Bobblehead Joe. Someone complained that the men's room is whites only. Stanley, you know that's not true. I didn't say that. Then why is there a picture of a white man on the door. Okay. Phyllis, you complained that Angela is giving you dirty looks and you tried to get off the party-planning committee. I never said any such thing. Angela and I are close. And, also, Phyllis, Stanley says that you cry too much and that that bugs him. Stanley and I are close, too. We sit close. MICHAEL: Okay. Just take it. I can't believe Angela. And I went against my better judgment and I gave her a Save-the-Date. And now it turns out she complained about me to Toby. Well, it was redacted. Look, if she wants an invite, maybe she's just trying to be friends. Don't take her side. Well, what does Roy think about everything? I don't know. I try not to bother him about this kind of stuff. You mean, like your thoughts and feelings. Yeah. Yeah. I know you keep saying it's your space even though there's no assigned parking, but I keep forgetting. Yes, that's the problem. I guess so. Okay. Well, all settled then. I don't like you. Okay. Ryan, you told Toby that Creed has a distinct old man smell? I know exactly what he's talking about. I sprout mung beans on damp paper towel in my desk drawer. Very nutritious, but they smell like death. All right, Kevin. You are accused of making sexually suggestive remarks to Angela that made her feel uncomfortable. Solution: Angela, you are to make sexually suggestive remarks to Kevin that will make him uncomfortable. I accept your decision. Hey, you know what, Dwight? Maybe we should get our photo ID taken together. That doesn't make any sense. Well, it saves time, you know. 'Cause we could just meet in the parking lot every morning, walk in together. Perfect. PHOTOGRAPHER: Smile. No. I never smile, if I can help it. Showing one's teeth is a submission signal in primates. When someone smiles at me, all I see is a chimpanzee begging for its life. This came out really well. There you go. This is humongous. I am not a security threat. And my middle name is Kurt, not fart. What did I write? I have another complaint for Jim's permanent file. Talk to Michael. I gave him the box. What box? I didn't report your snoring Over here. God, God, God! No! No! Four years of malfeasance unreported. This cannot stand. Okay. Calm down. No, you calm down. Whose side is Toby on? Whose side are you on? Hey! Him or me? Him or me? I cannot work with Jim anymore. Either he goes or I go. Dwight. Stop. You choose! One of us is out of here by the end of today! Okay. I am not bluffing. Okay? Okay. Yes. Do the right thing here, Michael. Okay. I have served you loyally for years. I deserve this. You know I do. You know, your ID says you're a security threat. You have till 5:00. (CLEARING THROAT) DWIGHT: Oh, look, Jim. There's a sales manager position open in Stamford. Want me to call Jan and tell her you're interested? I could put in a good word for you 'cause I'll still be working here. Transfer. Transfer. Everybody! Transfer! Transfer! Transfer! Okay, you two. In the conference room with me. Nobody leaves until we work this out. Cage match. Cage matches? Yeah, they work. How could they not work? If they didn't work, everybody would still be in the cage. Okay. So, Dwight, in your own words, "Someone replaced all my pens and pencils with crayons. I suspect Jim Halpert. "Everyone has called me Dwayne all day. I think Jim Halpert paid them to." Yes. 5 bucks each and it was totally worth it. "This morning I found a bloody glove in my desk drawer, "and Jim Halpert tried to convince me I committed murder. "I think he may be the real murderer." "Jim Halpert said there was an abandoned infant in the women's room. "When I went to save the child, I saw Meredith on the can." Gag. "This morning, I knocked myself in the head with the phone." JIM: That actually took a while. I had to put more and more nickels into his handset, till he got used to the weight. And then I just took them all out. "Every time I typed my name, it said diapers." Just a simple macro. You know, these actually don't sound that funny, one after another. But he does deserve it, though. "By the end of the day, my desk was about two feet closer to the copier." Yeah. I just moved it an inch every time he went to the bathroom. And that's how I spent my entire day, that day. MICHAEL: The Japanese have this thing called shiatsu massage, where they dig into your body very hard. And it is very painful and, apparently, some people throw up. But the next day they feel great. I've never had one. They sound awful. Maybe Stamford would be cool. It's a good market. Higher volume. Yeah. Maybe we should both go. I have a girlfriend. Sure you do, Dwight. Sure. Hey. There's, like, Let's get to them later. So, are you going to transfer Jim or not? Maybe. I haven't decided yet. Let's get to work. I want an answer by tomorrow. Okay. Actually, tomorrow's not good. How about later in the week? Fine. Good. Okay. Hey! Wait. How about a group picture, while you're here? I can't. I only get reimbursed for the ID photos. Well, it's a computer camera, right? You mean digital? Yeah. It'll take like two seconds. (SIGHING) All right. Everybody, come on! Group photo for the newsletter! You've gotta be kidding. MICHAEL: Come on, everybody. Come on. Let's go. Creed, Kevin, Oscar, andale! Let's go. One, two, three, smile. Try to smile. We resolved a lot today, everybody. Think happy thoughts. All right, I'm just gonna take it on three, whether you smile or not. One, two, three. Good. Let's check that out. (MICHAEL EXCLAIMS IN DISGUST) Okay. All right. One more. Take one more. That'll be another $20. What? Angela, I want to talk to you about something. What? No, Pam. I am. It's about the Save-the-Date. Pam, it wasn't her. What? I'm the one who complained about you. I didn't know that Toby was going to write it down. MICHAEL: Good. I was just venting. Check that out. You know, it was just It was one day. MICHAEL: That's terrible. I took it right back. It was just like Okay. Oh, dear. Okay. We can do this. Come on, everybody. All right. Here we go. MICHAEL: It was really hard getting a good picture of 15 people. He would not give me a discount, and eight tries added up. One, two Didn't say "three," did I? But I'm sort of an expert at Photoshop, so it turned out fine in the end. When people work together, there is going to be conflict. You can't outrun your problems. Hey, Pam. It's Jim. I have a doctor's appointment in the city, so I probably won't be in till the late afternoon. Just thought I'd let you know. Okay, bye. Okay, Jan will see you now. Oh, thanks. MICHAEL: And that is why the idea of a cage match is so universally appealing. But here's the thing about cage matches, sometimes you have to open the cage. And that is something that Toby will never understand. Yeah, I'm not a temp anymore. I got Jim's old job, which means at my 10-year high school reunion, it will not say, "Ryan Howard is a temp. " It will say, "Ryan Howard is a junior sales associate "at a mid-range paper supply firm. " That'll show them. You have no idea how long I've wanted to do that. Me, too. I think we're just drunk. No, I'm not drunk. Are you drunk? No. Jim. You're really going to marry him? Okay. Jim is gone. He's gone. I miss him so much. I cry myself to sleep. Jim. False. I do not miss him. No. That is the fun of this place. I call everybody faggy. Why would anyone find that offensive? Okay. I think Oscar would just like it if you used lame or something like that. That's what faggy means. No, not really. Oh. Apparently you called Oscar faggy. Yeah. For liking the movie Shakespeare in Love more than an action movie. It wasn't just an action movie, it was Die Hard. All right, Michael, but Oscar's really gay. Exactly. I mean for real. Yeah, I know. No. He's attracted to other men. Okay. Little too far. Crossed the line. Okay. I am telling you, Oscar is an actual homosexual. Yeah. He told me this morning. And obviously he hopes he can count on your discretion. I would have never called him that if I knew. You don't call retarded people retards. It's bad taste. You call your friends retards when they're acting retarded. And I consider Oscar a friend. Listen, man, I am so sorry. I had no idea. Oh, it's fine. It's okay. It's okay. No. No. It's okay. No, it's not. I just I feel terrible about it. I have been calling people faggy since I was in junior high, and I have never made this mistake. If I don't know how to behave, it is because I am just so far the opposite way. You know? I'm just I I can't even imagine the thing Maybe we could go out for a beer sometime and you could tell me how you do that to another dude. That sounds like a great, wonderful idea. Let's do that. It explains so much. No. I'm not gay. And I don't understand why anyone would think that I'm gay if Yeah, I'm gay. I can't say whether Dunder Mifflin paper is less flammable, sir, but I can assure you that it is certainly not more flammable. Why did I transfer to Stamford? I think that's pretty obvious. I got promoted. And you can't beat that view, right? Hey, Big Tuna, you're single, right? Yeah, I am. Pretty hot, huh? She's completely crazy. Steer clear, Big Tuna. Head for open waters. Okay. Okay. I ate a tuna sandwich on my first day, so Andy started calling me Big Tuna. I don't think any of them actually know my real name. Big Tuna is a super ambitious guy, you know, cut your throat to get ahead type of guy. But, I mean, I'm not threatened by him. I went to Cornell. You ever heard of it? I graduated in four years, I never studied once, I was drunk the whole time and I sang in the a cappella group Here Comes Treble. So, end of day we are going to have a little diversity policy freshener because of some more problems at the Scranton branch. And I have a list of business start-ups I got from the chamber. Yes. I am going to need someone to cold call them. Oh, I can do that. Jim's nice enough. I don't know how well he's fitting in here. He's always looking at the camera, like this. What is that? Can you tell who's gay and who is not? Of course. What about Oscar? Absolutely not. Well, he is. Well, he's not dressed in women's clothes, so There could be others. I need to know. I don't want to offend anybody else. You could assume everyone is and not say anything offensive. Yeah. I'm sure everyone would appreciate me treating them like they were gay. Hey, what about Angela? She's hard and severe. She could be a gay woman. I really don't think so. I don't know. I can imagine her with another woman, can't you? Do some research. Find out if there's a way to tell by just looking at them. Jim told me you could buy gaydar online. That's ridiculous. Yeah. Probably. He didn't tell the truth a lot. Let's call him and get the website. Definitely. What's gaydar? Oh, oh, gaydar, yes! No, I think they have it at Sharper Image. Oh, you know what? I can check for you. No problem. It's sold out. Yeah. Sorry about that. That's a bummer. They're sold out. Damn. I'll try Brookstone. I miss that. Chicken or fish? Chicken. So, you having a good day? Excellent. Thanks. Good. I'm glad. Okay. Yeah, I didn't go through with the wedding. I got cold feet a few days before, and I can't really explain it. I just had to get out of that relationship. We still had to pay for all the food, so we froze it. But I'm doing well. I have my own apartment and I'm taking art classes. And I have lunch for the next five weeks. After Pam dumped me, I kind of stopped taking care of myself for a while there, and I hit bottom when I had a drunk driving arrest. Yeah, I've been working out and, you know, I'm not going to take her for granted. I got to win her back. I got them a toaster. They called off the wedding and gave the toaster back to me. I tried to return the toaster to the store and they said they no longer sold that kind of toaster. So now my house has got two toasters. It is so cool that you're gay. I totally underestimated you. Yes, I am super cool. I am an accountant at a failing paper supply company in Scranton. Much like Sir Ian McKellen. Sure, sometimes I watch Will &amp; Grace and I want to throw up. It's terribly loud. I do like it sometimes when Harry Connick Jr. Is on. He's so talented. Okay, who put my calculator in JELL-O? Good one. But, seriously, guys, who did this? Seriously, guys. Who did this? I need to know who put my calculator in JELL-O or I'm going to lose my freaking mind! You know, it's amazing to me that in this day and age, you can be so obtuse about sexual orientation. I watch The L Word, okay? Good. Good. I watch Queer as so That's not what it's called. Okay, Michael, are you aware that you outed Oscar today? What? What does that even Coming out is a significant moment for a gay person. And they should be allowed to select the timing and manner of announcing it. Well, gay pride, right? Gay pride parade. It's not, like, gay shame festival. All right, now Oscar's feeling discriminated against by his co-workers, primarily Angela, and that's your fault. I think Angela might be gay. Could Oscar and Angela be having a gay affair? No! Maybe. Is that what this is about? No. No. It's not possible. I don't Anything's possible. Okay, you know, imagine you were gay. Well, I'm not gay, Jan, and you should know that better than anybody. Michael, your immaturity is extremely disappointing and may even lead to a lawsuit, which is the absolute last thing this company needs right now. Yes. Do you understand? I know. The company has made it my responsibility today to put an end to 100,000 years of being weirded out by gays. Am I the first gay man you ever knew? Trick question. 'Cause you can't always tell, so how would I know? Was that the right answer? Yup. Michael, Dwight's looking at gay pornography on his computer. Michael knows, Pam, okay? He asked me to do this just for him. He has his own reasons. Okay. Nothing wrong with this stuff at all. This is fine. You know what? Gay porn, straight porn, it's all good. I don't particularly get into this but, you know what, I totally see the merit. And actually, it is quite beautiful. Oh, damn pop-ups. What are you doing? Watching some of your friends. This is stupid. Excuse me. Don't touch me! Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Stop it! All right, everybody in the conference room! I don't care if you are gay, or straight, or a lesbian or overweight, just get in here! Right now! Did you know that gay used to mean happy? When I was growing up, it meant lame. And now it means a man who makes love to other men. We're all homos, Homo sapiens. Gays aren't necessarily who you think they are What?  people. I mean, anybody can be gay. Businessmen, like antique dealers, or hairdressers or accountants. Oscar, why don't you take this opportunity to officially come out to everybody here however you want to do it? Go ahead. Stand up. I'm doing this for you. Yes, I'm gay. And I didn't plan on sharing that part of my life with you today, so, whatever. Can I sit down now? I'm not offended by homosexuality. In the '60s, I made love to many, many women, often outdoors, in the mud and the rain, and it's possible a man slipped in. There would be no way of knowing. Who should be the judges and juries of our society? Judges and juries. Yes. That's a good point. She has a good point. Because gay marriage currently is not legal under U.S. Law. I bet a lot of straight men wished that applied to them so they could go out there and have some torrid, unabashed monkey sex as much as they could. You know? Sounds pretty good, right? That sounds great. Yeah, Dwight. I think all the other office gays should identify themselves or I will do it for them. No one else in this office is gay. What about Phyllis? She makes absolutely no attempt to be feminine. I'm getting married to Bob Vance. You are? No way! Congratulations, Phyllis. When did you get that? That's great. Congratulations, Phyllis. That is great, and frankly, kind of amazing. See? Everybody has a chance. Thank you. But, still Phyllis, in college, did you ever experiment with other women? A lot of women do. No, and you knew me in high school. Of course, we all thought you were gay in high school. Right. And I take that as a compliment. Well, with your ties and your matching socks Well, I just like to look good, okay? So You sound pretty defensive, Michael. No. I am just coming out myself. I am coming out hetero! I think the problem with this office is that you are sending mixed signals about my being here. No. No. The only signal that I am sending is gay good! Look, if I was gay, I would be the most flamboyant gay you've ever seen. I would be leading the parade covered in feathers and just I'd be waving that rainbow flag. I don't think I can work here any longer. This has been the worst, most backwards day of my life. You misunderstand Okay. All right You know what? Okay. Okay. I'm going to put my money where my mouth is. You ready? What are you doing? I am going to embrace Oscar. You might want to watch us, Angela, because you can't catch anything. Here we go. No. We are going to make a statement. You and I are going to make a statement together. Oscar is my friend. I'd rather not. And I just don't care who sees it. Doesn't bother me. Really, I really would rather not. Come here, friend. I'd really rather not. You're my friend. No! No! I don't want to touch you. Ever considered that? You're ignorant and insulting and small. Okay. All right. I'm sorry. Michael, I'm sorry. That was a good idea. Come on. Come on. All right. I'm sorry I called you faggy. I know. I know. You're not faggy. I know you are. You're a good guy. You, too. Michael appears to be gay, too. And yet he is my friend. I guess I do have a gay friend. You know what, I'm going to raise the stakes. You don't I want you to watch this and I want you to burn this into your brains. I don't think we need to do this Because this is an image that I want you people to remember for a long time to come. Whenever you come into the office, I want you to think about this. We don't need to. Yes, we do. What? I did it! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. See, I'm still here. We're all still here. Oh, come on, Dwight! Come on, man! We are not in the playground anymore. There are new rules. We have to be mature, but we can't lose the spirit of childlike wonder. What is love anyway? Maybe it's supposed to break all the rules. Like me and Jan. Or Oscar and some guy. Life is short. When two people find each other, what should stand in their way? It is very easy for you to be a hero. All you need are honesty, empathy, respect and open-mindedness. I'm glad if today spurred social change. That's part of my job as regional manager. But, you know what, even if it didn't, at least we put this matter to bed. That's what she said. Or he said. Oh, there's Gil, Oscar's roommate. I wonder if he knows. I was going to quit, but Jan offered me a three-month, paid vacation and a company car. All I had to do was sign something saying I won't sue. Gil and I are going to Europe. Kids, sometimes it pays to be gay. "Hope this helps. Jim. " Nice. What are you doing? Don't be scared. It works. Oh, no. David Oh, Michael Are we all set? Isn't our interview tomorrow? Yes. I just happened to be in the neighborhood. Thought I'd drop in and say hello. Just happened to be in midtown Manhattan? Thought I'd catch a show. In the middle of a workday? No. You know what, since I'm here, let me ask you a few questions about the job. Okay. How many people are you interviewing? We're only interviewing branch managers and some lower-level company people. Ah, well, good. Out of curiosity, are you interviewing anyone who has been here longer than I have or manages more people? I don't think so. Great. One more question. When you merged those branches, who did you put in charge? I believe we put you in charge. Ah, great. No further questions. Okay, Michael. Okay. I'm really looking forward to our interview. And I'm really looking forward to working with you. I have got it made in the shade. I know this company. The other branch managers are total morons. Hey, Pam, yeah, I forgot what day the interview was. I drove to New York accidentally. Be, like, three hours late. See, I have 600 Yeah, I don't have Hey. Hey, Kev. What's different about you? You look worse. Thank you. You got a haircut. It's sexy hot. Oh. Turn around. No. Come on. No, thanks. Do it! Look at that do! What's up, Big Haircut? You are no longer Big Tuna. From henceforth, you shall be known as Big Haircut. Andy. What is it, Big Haircut? No. Sorry, I can't hear you, Big Haircut. Yep. What? Karen suggested that I get a haircut for the interview tomorrow, so that I could look presentable and not, as she so lovingly puts it, homeless. Hey. I think it looks great. Thanks, Pam. After I had my little outburst at the beach, Jim was really nice about it. He just basically said that he missed my friendship, too, and I would always mean a lot to him. And I understand where he's coming from. For the record, I am not embarrassed at all. It needed to be said and I said it and it only took me three years to summon the courage. So, thank you. Yeah? You wanted to see me? Yes. The time has come to name my own replacement. So Please hand this letter of congratulations to Dwight K. Schrute. But that's my name. "Dwight, congratulations, a-wipe. " "Don't screw the pooch. " Thank you. Okay. All right. Thank you, Michael. Okay. Thank you so much. Hey, stop crying. Thank you. Hey. Hey. About the beach It's okay. We all say things without thinking. Oh, no. It's not that. I've actually been thinking that for a long time and I'm glad I said it. I just am sorry if it made you feel weird. Oh. Okay. Pam is kind of a bitch. Hey, what if we leave tonight? Grab a bite, get a hotel room, enjoy the city a little bit? I just have so much paperwork to do. Wow. Done. Okay, let's do it. So I was wondering if Karen and I could get off a few hours early because we wanted to spend the night in the city. Why, so you can do it? Whoops. No, well, I was thinking that, actually, we can all leave tomorrow and do a convoy, you know? Convoys are really fun. Pull up next to each other, give each other the finger. Moon each other. We're going to go tonight, but we're going to see you there tomorrow morning, right? All right. All right. Your loss. Wait, how would you moon us if you were driving? Cruise control. Oh. So, Jim, who do you think is hotter, Pam or Karen? Yeah, I'm not going to talk about this now. Pam is taller. You sure? Yes. She has bigger breasts, too. Wow. But I think Karen has a prettier face. What else? Well, I mean, Pam's face is really pretty, too. It's a very tough call. Really tough call. Yeah. You know what, why don't you take the rest of the day and figure it out and then come back and tell me what you've got. Will do. All right. Yes. Hey, Pam, I've been meaning to say something to you. I really miss our friendship. That's very funny. I've never heard you talk that much. I thought it was Kelly. Are you kidding? I would never have done that. It was Patheticville. No offense, Pam. You know what, don't even worry about it. Everyone was so drunk, I bet no one even remembers what you said. I remember. I blogged the whole thing. Www. creedthoughts. gov. Wwwlcreedthoughts. Check it out. Last year, Creed asked me how to set up a blog. Wanting to protect the world from being exposed to Creed's brain, I opened up a Word document on his computer and put an address at the top. I've read some of it. Even for the Internet, it's pretty shocking. There they are, the accounting department. I shall miss your humility and your promptly printed checks. Do you think it's going to be weird working with Jan in New York? No. Not at all. I haven't talked to Jan since we broke up. And I think if she had something to say, she would have called me. Maybe you should talk to her before No, no, no, no. You know what, it's a done deal. I basically have the job already. There's nothing she can do to stop it now. I already sold my condo. Michael. What? Why? I'm sorry that just doesn't make sense. Yes. Why Who gave you that advice? Yeah, Michael, you should never I sell your condo. I have to buy another place. But you said you were in debt. I'm not. You're not sure that you have the job. I sold it on eBay. The buyer was very motivated as was I. It went for 80% of what I paid. Sold in record time. How would you like to spend the night with the regional manager of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton? No, Dwight, I don't care if that's how they consolidated power in ancient Rome, I'm No, no. Not Michael. Me. I'm taking his job. Not now. Goodbye, Kelly Kapour. Jim, Jim, Jim. Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim. Oh, hey, Dwight. I am going to be your new boss. It is my greatest dream come true. Welcome to the Hotel Hell. Check-in time is now. Checkout time is never. Does my room have cable? No. And the sheets are made of fire. Can I change rooms? Sorry, we're all booked up. Hell convention in town. Can I have a late checkout? I'll have to talk to the manager. You're not the manager? Even in your own fantasy? I'm the owner. The co-owner. With Satan. Okay. Just so I understand it, in your wildest fantasy, you are in Hell and you are co-running a bed and breakfast with the Devil. Yeah, but I haven't told you my salary yet. Go. $80,000 a year. Once I am officially regional manager, my first order of business will be to demote Jim Halpert. So I will need a new number two. My ideal choice? Jack Bauer. But he is unavailable, fictional, and overqualified. I will see you at the interview. Yes, you will. Who is D. Abramson? He's from that company in Pittsburgh. Michael. Why are you here? How are you? I'm good. How are you, Janet? I'm I'm great. It's good to see you. Can we Can we talk privately for a minute? Why privately? I just I don't I don't like the way that we left things. Okay, sure. Fine. Why don't you wait in my office? I have some important business matters to take care of. Okay. Okay. Pam, DEFCON 10. Houston, we have a problem. What do you want me to do? I may need some immediate assistance. If you would slowly and quietly gather the ladies in the conference room, Phyllis, Angela, Karen. What about Meredith? No. She's an alternate. So, how you been? I'm good. Good. Good. Good. Yeah. Sorry to drop by unexpectedly. I I tried calling, but I kept getting voicemail. Weird. Yeah. I didn't get both of your messages. So, Michael needs us in the conference room. Oh, is it Jan again? Hey, before I leave tonight, would you mind making half a dozen copies of Jim's and my sales reports for our interviews tomorrow? Sure. Thanks. I really hope you get the job. Thanks. After you ended everything with us, I went on a vacation to kind of clear my mind. Sounds good. Sounds fun. It was. Yeah, it was good. I think I should just Get right to the point, you know. Okay. I I feel good about myself for the first time in a really long time, and I've made some big changes in my life, and I miss you. I want us to get back together. Would you excuse me for a second? Oh. DEFCON 20. She wants to get back together. What are you going to do? I don't know. That's why you're here. Help me. Please. Would you want to get back together with her? No. No. What do I do? Just don't get back together with her. What if she makes me? How can she make you get back together with her? She made me do a lot of things I didn't want to do. This was a terrible relationship. You were not happy when you were with her. I wasn't. You're so much happier now. Just go in there and be strong. You're right. You are absolutely right. I need to go in there and tell her that we can't be together. Right. Wow. Do it. I'm in a very good place right now. Okay. Thank you. Go. Okay. Jan, we need to talk. Jan is in a different place right now. And it is a sign of maturity to give people second chances. So I'm going to hear her out. Oh, my God. Yeah. Bigger actually. That's crazy. Oh, my God. Can you believe that? Unbelievable. Wow! She could put the cup right there. I know. No, it's fine. I'm sure it must have been weird for Jim when Roy and I were joking around that one time. I would never do that. Waste of money. In my experience, guys are way more attracted to the back of you than to the front. I love fake boobs. Oftentimes you find them on strippers. I find it offensive. Au naturel, baby. That's how I like them. Swing low, sweet chariots. So, there are a lot of things I would like to do differently. Yeah. I feel like when we first got together, that I had a problem with my priorities. First stop, priorities. And if we could talk about a way to approach a possible reconciliation. Let's get back together. No. No, no, no. I'll tell you this, it is not because of the boob job. Excuse me, boob enhancement. That would be shallow. And this is the opposite of shallow. This is emotionally magnificent. Okay, everyone, listen up! Time to begin the interview process. Andrew Bernard. Save the best for first. All right, you guys, see you later. Wish us luck. No. Hey, hey, do not wish them luck. Do not wish them luck. All luck must be wished unto Michael. Good luck, you guys. Good luck. What did I say? Good luck. Thanks. I'm happy for him. I hope he gets the job. I really just want him to be happy. And I know that sounds cliche, and I know saying it sounds cliche sounds cliche. Maybe I'm being cliche. I don't care because I am what I am. That's Popeye. I am going to begin this process with a simple test of intelligence and mental dexterity. What is the best color? White. Because it contains all other colors. Wrong. Black. It is the most dominant. How do you make a table? You make a chair, but you don't sit on it. What is the capital of Maine? The capital of Maine is Montpelier, Vermont, which is near Ithaca, New York where I went to Cornell. Okay, also, moratorium on Cornell talk. Don't want to hear about it. Forget your personal history and learn the history of this company. Should not be a problem. I minored in history in the Ivy League school which I attended. You're not off to a very good start, Bernard. I agree. But in another way, I am off to a very good start, wouldn't you say? I am a great interviewee. Why? Because I have something no one else has, my brain, which I use to my advantage when advantageous. Time! No, you failed. Damn it! This interview is over. I'll let you know. Hey, thank you so much for driving me down for my interview. Totally. No problem. What are you interviewing for, by the way? My assistant? Or Oh, you know, I'm going to have a congratulations Karen party tomorrow night at a friend's house. Oh, wow. That sounds fun. Is your friend named Karen, too? What did she accomplish? No. I'm sorry, I should have been clearer. It's for me. Oh. Because I'm going to get the job. How remarkable. Thanks. Wait, wait a second. Oh. Let me check one more thing. Okay. Very good. All right, well, I have to get back. But I will see you in New York tomorrow, right? Yes, indeed. Good luck with your interview. Thank you. Bye. So I guess we're getting back together. What happened? Your advice was good, but Jan's was bigger. Here's the sitch. Two weeks ago, I was in the worst relationship of my life. She treated me poorly, we didn't connect, I was miserable. Now, I'm in the best relationship of my life with the same woman. Love is a mystery. So, we have all night. Where do you want to go first? I don't know. How about the UN? How often do you come here? Every time my sixth grade class was on a field trip. I think you're really going to enjoy this, adult Jim. Hey, everybody, the next time you see me I will be working for corporate. Starting tomorrow, Dwight Schrute will be running the branch. So without further ado, I would like to start saying my goodbyes. For everything you've done You know I'm bound Okay. I'm bound to thank you for it Good night and good luck. Who's ready to work? Yeah. We went to the Spotted Pig for dinner. It's in the Village. Karen knew it. And then we second acted Spamalot. That's when you sneak in at intermission with all the smokers. And then we went to a bar that used to be a church. Oh, and at this one bar, I swear I saw Lorne Michaels. That wasn't him. So what's going to happen with us when I get this job? Oh, you mean, when I get the job? Well, if you get the job, then I'd move here with you. Would you move with me? I'm not stupid, okay? I was at the beach. We don't have a future in Scranton. There's one too many people there. You mean, Kevin? Exactly. No, but you get it, right? I can't stay there. Yeah. I do. Come on. How are you guys doing? Need anything? No. We're good. Thanks. I have been here a bunch of times, so I know where everything is. Know everybody's names. If you need to know somebody's name, just ask me. Well, who's that? That is Beardy. Beardy? I'm going to introduce myself. No, no. That's not his real name. That's just what I call him. So I am by far the most qualified person they're interviewing. Jim and Karen are here, which is cute. They're like kid actors tagging along with Daddy on the big audition, hoping to be discovered, except Daddy is the best actor around. Daddy is Meryl Streep. Michael is gone. Hail to the chief. My first order of business, make Andrew Bernard my number two. My first order of business, accept. As if you have a choice. Duh. Opportunity of a lifetime. Three months ago, I was nowhere. I was just a Cornell grad in anger management. Look where I am now. Not bad. Hey, Hunter. What's up, my brother? This is Hunter, secretary extraordinaire. Administrative assistant. Jan in yet? I think she's coming in later. Could you give her a message for me when she gets in? Sure. Just say I want to squeeze them. It's code. She'll know what it means. Okay. Oh, Hunter, could you tell her also? You showed great leadership potential at the coal walk, even if you did follow it with that embarrassing personal confession. Thank you. I had to make Andy my number two. It's political, complicated. You wouldn't understand. I want you to be assistant regional manager. Really? Well, in a sense. Although, publicly, I am going to retain the assistant regional manager position. You will be your own assistant. Correct. I need someone I can trust. But I would also like the title to be secretly applied to you. Just stripped off its pomp and frills. Okay. So you would be the regional manager and the assistant regional manager, Andy is your number two. I would be the secret assistant regional manager. Let's call it secret assistant to the regional manager. Do you accept? Absolutely I do. I learned from Jim, if Dwight ever asks you if you accept something secret, you reply, "Absolutely I do. " Hello, hello! Michael, good to see you. Good to see you. Have a seat. Here are the post-merger performance tests that you asked for. Great. I've been meaning to thank you, by the way. You didn't lose a single customer in the merger and you still managed to trim the budget. That is nice work. So, let me ask you a question right off the bat, what do you think are your greatest strengths as a manager? Why don't I tell you what my greatest weaknesses are? I work too hard, I care too much, and sometimes I can be too invested in my job. Okay. And your strengths? Well, my weaknesses are actually strengths. Oh. Yes. Very good. There you go. Very good. Dwight is our new boss. No, Michael's not going anywhere. Then who do you think will get the job? Karen. She looks corporate. Those little pantsuits. I think it's going to be Michael. Do you really think he's qualified for that job? No, but he wasn't qualified for the job he has now and he got that one. Yeah. Listen up. Come to the center of the room, please. This is a Schrute Buck. When you have done something good, you will receive one Schrute Buck. One thousand Schrute Bucks equals an extra five minutes for lunch. What is the cash value of a Schrute Buck? Excellent question, Pam. One one-hundredth of a cent. So, 10,000 of your dollars is worth one real dollar? Just Zip your lid. Another announcement. Michael wasted an enormous amount of the group's time and patience with non-work-related ethnic celebrations and parades of soft-minded do-goodedness. No longer. No more meetings. Amen. Instead, today I will begin my first lecture in a long series of lectures designed to increase your knowledge on the world of paper. Do we have to? Yes. Michael is gone. There's a new sheriff here in these offices and his name is me. Conference room, 10 seconds. All of you! I literally cannot wait until I see what Dwight has planned. And I wish Jim were here. What do you think we can be doing better? I've never been a big fan of the name Dunder Mifflin. I was thinking we could name the company something like Paper Great or Great Paper's Our Passion. We're great. I don't know. It could be good. Or Super Duper Paper. It's super duper. I don't know. Something like that. Okay. Okay. Thanks for coming in, Michael. Thank you. It is always a treat when our paths cross. It is always a treat when our paths cross. So, oh, before I forget, I wanted to let you know, if you hadn't already heard, Jan and I are back together. So I may need to fill out one of those love documents again. You're back together. Yes. And I am very excited about the prospect of working under her. Or on top of her. That's not sexual. Just We're all professionals. Okay. Well, I thought it was clear in the description of the position. The job you're applying for is Jan's job. I don't understand. So we're going to tag-team it? No. We're letting Jan go. Listen up. Let's start from the ground up. Where does paper come from? Trees. Trees. And where do trees grow? Soil. Forests. Right. We have in front of you here seven different types of Pennsylvania topsoil. Now, what would you say is the most important element in the production of aboveground leafy growth? Probably phosphorus, right? Wrong. It's nitrogen. Absorb this information. Good. Now, let us discuss precipitation. Stanley, when rainfall occurs, does it usually fall in a liquid, solid, or gaseous state? Liquid. Very good. You have earned one Schrute Buck. I don't want it. Then you have been deducted Make it 100. Well Don't you want to earn Schrute Bucks? No. In fact, I'll give you a billion Stanley Nickels if you never talk to me again. What's the ratio of Stanley Nickels to Schrute Bucks? The same as the ratio of unicorns to leprechauns. Okay. That's it! Class is canceled. Everybody out! No, wait, what are you doing? I'm punishing them. No, no, no, no. Class is not canceled. This is so stupid. Hey! Come on! Let's listen to Dwight's presentation. What What are you winking for? Zip your lid! So that's my basic five-year plan and then after that who knows? Okay. Now, this may seem like an odd question. Yeah? What do you think about Michael Scott? He's a very nice man. And he's very well-suited for the job he has now. This is off the record. He would be a disaster. Hey, you. Hey. How was your interview? Pretty good. Yeah? Could have gone better, I guess. Oh. Well, I will put in a good word for you. Cool. Maybe you should do it sooner rather than later. What? Let's just run away together. Let's just run away to Jamaica, live in a bungalow. You have some savings, right? You can pay off my debts. It would be fine. We'd have fun. What's What's the matter? What What happened in there? I can't tell you. Tell me what? You son of a bitch. Jan, this isn't the time. I'm in an interview You're firing me? Where the hell do you get off? Frankly, it's overdue. Your behavior in the last two years has been completely erratic. Erratic? Recently you don't even show an interest in your work. You smoke constantly in your office, you spend most of the day online shopping. You disappear for hours at a time, sometimes days, always saying you're visiting your sister in Scottsdale. You go to Scranton far more often than you Is it because of these? Whoa, hey, whoa, Jan. Come on Is it No, I want to know! I want to know! Because if it is, then Then I will see you in court. It's not. It's not. No. Because he likes them, okay? He likes them. And that is That is all I care about. The time has come for you to end your professional relationship with this company. You are clearly unstable. Hey, you're unstable. Yeah. No. We're all unstable. Okay, do you know what? I'm just not leaving. I'm not leaving. I'm not leaving. David, I did not tell her. It's like I'm staring into my soul when I look at this wall. It's like outer space without the stars. It's so black. This is going to look so awesome. It's so intimidating. Anyone who comes in here is going to have to take me seriously. Abandon all hope ye who enter here. Totally! Bye, Hunter. Bye. Good luck with your band. Oh, thank you Don't let them change you, okay? So long So I am going to give her a ride home. Let me know about the job. Actually, Michael, I think we're going to take it in another direction. Good. I'm glad we're on the same page. I have a lot of ideas for new directions. No, we're not giving you the job. You know what? That is actually good because I don't think I could take my girlfriend's job. That's not being a good boyfriend. So I respectfully withdraw my name from consideration. Do you accept my withdrawal? I do. Good. Very good. I'm glad we are finally on the same page. Still have my job in Scranton, though? Yes. Good. That's all I ever wanted. These two, either one of them, excellent candidates. Wow. That was some serious, hardcore self-destruction. Yeah. I kind of feel bad for her, though. Don't. She's nuts. Oh, man. You know what, this might take a while. You really don't have to stay if you don't want. Okay, good because a bunch of my friends are meeting downtown for lunch and I was going to meet them. So All right. Just call me when you're done. Sure. Good luck, Halpert. Thank you. Dunder Mifflin, this is Grace. Sure. Oh, God. I mean, I just don't understand. It's just so rude, you know. I know. I know. I mean, the absolute nerve of that guy. I am sorry about that. That was terrible. Oh, just No, actually, I think it's good. You know, it's fine, actually. I do. I really think it's great that it happened because, you know, my work has always been the thing that's gotten in the way of my happiness. So Yeah. Well, it's No, don't cry. It's going to be okay. Oh, I know. I know. It's just I'm sorry. It's just these painkillers that I started taking since the surgery. Oh, they make my moods totally unpredictable. Wow. What am I going to do? I don't know. Well, I guess you could come and stay at my condo. I think I could back out of the sale. Oh. I would probably get some negative feedback on my eBay profile, but Live together. Actually, wait a minute, this could be great. This could be perfect. You know, my full-time job can be our relationship. I can wear stretch pants and wait for you to come home at 5:15. It could work. This could work, really. I'll be back. And I am back. How did it go? No, no, Pam. I'm back for good. Kevin Nealon. Everybody, may I have your attention please? It is with great honor and privilege that I announce to you, I have officially withdrawn my name for consideration from the corporate job. I know, I know, I know. Michael, what are you thinking? You were a shoo-in. Well I got down there, I nailed the interview and the strangest thing happened. Why is my office black? To intimidate my subordinates. That's stupid. It was Andy's idea. You shouldn't have taken it. Bad management. Good thing I'm back. Ryan, coffee. I don't do that stuff anymore. No. It's for me, bimbo. Kids. So I'm back and I am never, ever, going to leave. I am going nowhere. This place is like the hospital where I was born, my house, my old age home and my graveyard for my bones. Did Karen get the job? Back to work. Still waiting on that coffee. Pam, hello. Dwight, hello. I wanted to thank you for helping me when you held the title of secret assistant to the regional manager. You served the office with great dignity. No, I don't know what the future holds. But I'm optimistic and I had fun goofing around with Dwight today. Jim and I are just too similar. Maybe one day I'll find my own Karen. But, you That is a You know, not A man. A man version. But until then I can hold my head up. I'm not gay. I don't know how I feel about hiring a Sixers fan. I should leave. Now, let me ask you a question, Jim. You're clearly a very bright guy. Thanks. Always hit your numbers, personable. You make a great impression on everyone you meet. I'm sorry, wait. So is the question, how did I get to be so awesome? Because I don't have an answer for you. Oh, hey, do you have your quarterly numbers Yes. Absolutely.  and questionnaire? Sorry to make you fill that thing out. Oh, no. Absolutely. It's just a HR formality. We have this very irritating HR guy here. He's probably the only person you're not going to like. Kendall. So, first up. There you go. How do you think you'd function here in New York? What's that? Oh, great. You know I just I really appreciate the buildings and the people, and there's just an energy that New York has. Not to mention they have places that are open past 8:00, so that's a bonus. You've been in the Scranton branch a long time. What have you liked most about that place? The friendships. Okay. Well, we want the person who takes this position to be here for the long haul. So, long haul, where do you see yourself in 10 years? How are your feet? Medium rare. Thanks. The real reason that I went to Stamford was because I wanted to be Not here. I know. And even though I came back, I just feel like I've never really come back. Well, I wish you would. Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam. Just one moment. I'll transfer you. I haven't heard anything. But I bet Jim got the job. I mean, why wouldn't he? He's totally qualified and smart. Everyone loves him. And if he never comes back again, that's okay. We're friends. And I'm sure we'll stay friends. We just We never got the timing right. You know, I shot him down and then he did the same to me and But you know what, it's okay. I'm totally fine. Everything is going to be totally Pam. Sorry. Are you free for dinner tonight? Yes. All right. Then it's a date. I'm sorry. What was the question? So I know we left the other day on a note of uncertainty, but after some more thought, I'm very pleased to be able to offer you this job. Great. I'm so glad. We're all very excited you're going to be joining us. It'll be nice to have another MBA around here. I'm excited, too. Okay. Bye. Who was that? Nobody. You and I are done. What?   Okay. Well I did not get the job in New-York. But I got the real prize domestic bliss. Jan made me breakfast this morning. Well, she bought the milk. It's soy. This is why I do it. That's what I have to come home to. She probably won't be up for a few hours. This is going be a very good year. Very good. Jan is at home. Jim is back. My protégé Ryan is at corporate. Good stuff. Andy and Dwight are rocking the sales team. I feel very blessed. Generally it's not a good idea to click on any internet offers that you haven't requested. What was the exact offer? It was for a video. Yeah, well, what kind of video? A cebrity sex tape. Really? What kind of celebrity? - Not relevant. - How much you paid for it? - You paid for it? - It all happened so fast! I broke up with Karen after the job interview. And, uh It was a little awkward when she came back from the city. She told me very clearly that just because we were broken up doesn't mean that she was going anywhere, because she had worked really hard for her career. But the next day, her desk was empty. And as for me and my current romantic life I, uh I'm single now and looking. So if you know anybody Jim and I went to dinner a few times when he got back from New York. I talked him through his breakup. It's really nice to be good friends again. Are you kidding me? Pam and Jim are totally hooking up. All they do is smile. They're just keeping it a secret. Right? I don't know. There is no evidence of intimacy. They've been in remarkably good moods. Could other things. Are you kidding me? And sunday, I'm thinking of going to that flea market at the drive-in. Oh, that sounds fun. I'm mountain biking on sunday in montage mountain. - Cool. - Yeah. Well, have fun with that. Ladies and gentlemen. I have some bad news. Meredith was hit by a car. - What? - Where? It happened this morning in the parking lot. I took her to the hospital. And the doctors tried to save her life. They did the best that they could. And she is going to be okay. What is wrong with you? Why did you have to phrase it like that? - So she's really going to be fine? - Yes. She has a slight pelvical fracture. But people have survived far worse. Thank God you were there. Yeah. Did you see who did it? No need. We can just check the security tapes. Yeah, kind of a good news/bad news there. I was able to be on the scene so quickly because I was in the car that hit her. Who was driving? Oh, Michael. One day Michael came in complaining about a speed bump on the highway. I wonder who he ran over then. - It's only Meredith. - Yeah, it's only Meredith. Thank God. But did you see the way they looked at me? Like I was a murderer or something. - Why did you it? - It was an accident. - Was she talking back? - No. Just got sick of that face? Did she owe you money? Is this downsizing? Did she spurn your advances? Hey, guys. We're all gonna visit Meredith at lunch. And we're kicking in $5 for flowers. Who's we? You and Jim? No, me and Stanley and Phyllis so far. I bet Jim goes too. I haven't asked him yet. - I bet you ask. - I was planning on it. I bet you were. Angela? Are you coming? I can't. Sprinkles is sick. She's been sick for some time. Thank you for asking. No one asks about Sprinkles. I have to give her her meds, I have to pet her. And who will she eat lunch with? Can't your other cats keep her company? There's bad blood. Jealousies, cliques. Angela, you're the chairman of the party planning committee. I shouldn't even be planning this. It's your job. All right! - My lord, my lieg. - Yes, Michael? So Ryan got promoted to corporate where he is a little fish in a big pond. Whereas back here in Scranton, I'm still top dog in a fairly large pond. So whos the real boss? The dog or a fish? So I need a little treat for the gang. Something to win their affections back. Back? Why is that, Michael? Well, I ran down Meredith in my car. - Did you do this on purpose? - No, I was being negligent. But she's in the hospital, she's fine, recovering nicely. Tiny little crack in her pelvis. - But she will - It happened on company property? Yes. It was on company property with company property, so Double jeopardy, we are fine. I don't think you understand how jeopardy works.  Oh, right, I'm sorry. What is "we're fine"? People keep calling me a "wunderkind. " I don't even know what that means. I mean, I know what it means. It means very successful for your age. So I guess it makes sense, but It's a weird word. - Hey, D. - Hey monkey, what's up? Can you do me a favor? Go to my place and give Sprinkles her medicine? Sure. I have to visit the alkie. Check to see if she's faking. If a car hit me, it wouldn't crack my pelvis. You know what? I bet she cracked it at home. Jumped in front of the car to get some worker's comp. I wouldn't put it past her. - So what do you need me to do? - I wrote it out. There's a diabetes shot. Roll the insulin in your hands, don't shake it. She gets an ace inhibitor with her meal. But put her right in front of the dish, or her cataracts won't let her see it. Mix one capsule of omega fatty acid in with her kidney medicine. And you wanna give that to her And there's a fungal cream, because she has this infection under her tail. So you're gonna have to lift her tail and put the cream right at the base. Okay, I have an announcement. You pushed Darryl out the window? - You shot Dwight? - No. No, that is not funny. I love my employees. Even though I hit one of you with my car. For which I take full responsibility. Look, I'm just trying to take everybody's mind off of this unavoidable tragedy and on to more positive things. So I thought we should plant a tree. Oh, good. That means we don't have to work. We're leaving for the hospital at 1:00. So, like, a freedom tree. - I can take 3 people. - I can also take 3 people. - Separate cars. - Pam? We'll get a card at the hospital, and we'll sign it outside her room. Sales people can go later in the day. Hourly workers can go at lunch. Okay, good, good. So we'll just all go down there together at lunch. - Excellent. - I was thin - Good work, Pam. - But if you All right, since im the boss, I will drive as well. Who wants shotgun? You can't be serious. You ran a woman over this morning. Everybody inside the car was fine, Stanley! Guess what? I have flaws. What are they? Oh, I don't know. I sing in the shower. Sometimes, I spend too much time volunteering. Occasionally, I'll hit somebody with my car. So sue me. No, don't sue me. That's the opposite of the point that I am trying to make. I hate hospitals. In my mind, they are associated with sickness. She looks like an angel. She looks awful. No okay. She always looks like that, it was not my fault. I think she's awake. She's in the coma. I brought all your friends from the office. - At the same time. - Yep. - Hello, Meredith. - This is weird. Brought you some balloons. Why don't we Here you go. Tie these up, cheer up your tubes. Oh, for God's sake. - Nurse! - No, don't bother the nurse. Just put it back in. I am going to be sick. I'm going to puke. I wouldn't I wouldn't worry about it. - Don't touch it. - What are you doing? Just gimme that. Thanks. Does it hurt terribly? No, it's not too bad. They have me on a lot of painkillers. Really? What kind, codeine? Vicodin? Percocet? Fentanyl? Oxycontin? - Palladone? - I have no idea. Well, it was really great of all of you to come and visit me at the same time. I'll see you guys at the office. Okay, wait up, wait up, guys. Guys, guys, hold on a sec. You know what I was thinking might be sort of fun? Is if you forgave me in front of everybody. I'm not gonna do that. 'Cause you know what they say in the bible about forgiveness? Forgiveness is next to godliness. No, that's not - You cracked my pelvis. - Look, I jus I don't understand what is preventing you from laughing this off and giving me a big hug. You're not forgiven. Come on. Do I need to be liked? Absolutely not. I like to be liked. I enjoy being liked. I have to be liked. But it's not, like, this compulsive need to be liked. Like my need to be praised. Hey. hey, monkey. Any problems? Well, you left the TV on. And your cat is dead. - What?! - Sparkles, the white one, is dead. Sprinkles. That was the sick one, right? But I thought she had more time. Did she look When you saw her, how was she looking? Really dead. Like a, just a dead cat. So Hey, come on. Don't be sad. Just Okay? Just - She's in a better place. - All right. Actually, the place that she's in is the freezer. Because of the odor. It's gonna be okay. Okay, you know what? Everybody, let's just get over the whole Meredith thing. She cracked her pelvis. A tiny, little crack. And she's gonna be fine. So let just Michael, Angela's cat died. Sprinkles? I'm sorry, Angela. Man, what a day, huh? How could it get any worse? Her computer crashes with the porn, and then Meredith with the accident, and then Sprinkles! God! That's three things. I'll tell you what's going on. This office is cursed. And we need to do something about it. Well, I am taking responsibility. An it's up to me to get rid of the curse that hit Meredith with my car. I'm not supersticious, but I'm I am a little sticious. Did anyone do anything involving an indian burial ground? - Like what? - Like park on it. Or dig up a body. Toby? Do you have anything you wanna tell us? No, I did not violate an indian burial ground. In fact, I had some good luck recently. Alfredo's pizza picked my business card out of the basket, so I get a week of free pies. - That's cool. - Yeah. Perfect. So our tragedy is your good luck. Satan. Sprinkles never hurt a soul. God, in your infinite wisdom, how can you do this? She wasn't ready. She had so much left to accomplish. It is only a cat. You never You don't like them. Cats do not provide milk or wool or meat. - Dwight, you haven't seen Meredith? - No, I have not. Well, I think you should go to the hospital and pay your respects. I do not respect her. But I will go. All right. I would now like to talk about each of your individual religious beliefs. Oh, Michael, you can't ask about religious beliefs. Satan is the master of lies. Everything he says is the opposite. All right, well, then you can ask about religious beliefs. Thank you for the permission. Psych! Alright, let's just go around the room, and tell me what you believe in. - Catholic. - Okay. - Presbyterian. - Oh, me too. - For real? - Same religion. I'm a lutheran, and bob is a unitarian. It keeps things spicy. That's why we're cursed. I've been involved in a number of cults, both as a leader and a follower. You have more fun as a follower but you make more money as a leader. Kelly, you are hindu. So you believe in Buddha. That's buddhists. Are you sure? No. What are you? Well, if you're gonna reduce my identity to my religion, then I'm sikh. But I also like hip-hop and NPR. And I'm restoring a 1967 corvette in my spare time. Okay. So one sikh, and As a farmer, I know that when an animal is sick, sometimes the right thing to do is to put it out of its misery. With the electricity used to keep Meredith alive, we could power a small fan for two days. You tell me what's unethical. Blink once if you want me to pull the plug. Don't pull any plugs. How are you doing, miss Palmer? - Better. - Excellent. Are you a doctor or a male nurse? I'm an intern, which makes me a doctor. Her chart doesn't indicate that she had a hysterectomy, but she did, or at least, she got time off for one. So that is where her uterus went. Your last tetanus shot was when you were bitten by a bat a few months ago? Yes. Dwight here trapped it in a bag against my head. Just doing my job. You also were recently bitten by a raccoon? And a rat. Separate occasions. Spend your whole life trying to get people to like you, and then you run over one person with your car. And it's not even one of the popular ones. Everybody gets on your case. Doesn't make any sense. God is dead. If there was a god, then Ryan and I would be married by now. Maybe believing in god was a mistake. What did people believe in before? The sun? Maybe there's some sort of animal that we could make a sacrifice to. Like a giant buffalo. Or some sort of monster, like something with the body of a walrus with the head of a sea lion. Or something with the body of an egret with the head of a meerkat. Or just the head of a monkey with the antlers of a reindeer. With the body of a porcupine. I will do some research. - Okay. - I can help you with that. So just to be safe, they are giving her the rabies vaccine. God, rabies? I was in the hospital room with her. How contagious is that? Is that like an STD? - No. You gotta be bitten by something. - This place is so cursed. Actually, the doctor said she was lucky, 'cause the only way to beat rabies is to start treatment before the symptoms set in. Lockjaw. I know a lot of you are very upset with me for endangering Meredith's life by hitting her with my car. But it may make you feel a little bit better to know that before that happened Dwight endangered her life by putting a garbage bag over her head and it had a bat in it. Six of one, really. Turns out, Meredith has been exposed to rabies. Which is, like, ten times worse than a little crack in your pelvis. Thanks to me, she went to the hospital, and that saved her life. Curse is broken. Curse is broken, people! Oh, there is a god! And he has a plan for us after all. So go home, get some rest. Very, very good work today. Got a lot accomplished. Is there a god? If not, what are all these churches for? And who is Jesus' dad? Oh, well. If they aren't together now, then they probably never will be. I thought they'd be good together. Like PB &amp; J. Pam Beesly and Jim. What a waste. What a waste. I told you I'm not dating anyone. And even if I was, I don't think it's anyone's business. I mean, when I do fall in love, like, when it's for real, the last person I'm gonna talk about it to is a camera crew or my coworkers. Almost marrying Roy Anderson was as close to Pamela Anderson as I ever wanna be. Trust me, when I fall in love, you'll know. Michael Scott's Dunder Mifflin Scranton Meredith Palmer memorial celebrity rabies awareness fun run race for the cure, this is Pam. Pro-am. Pro-am race for the They hung up. A woman shouldn't have to be hit by a car to learn that she may have rabies. But that is where we are in America. And that does not sit right with me. And that is why I'm hosting a fun run race for the cure for rabies To raise awareness of the fact that there is a cure for rabies. A disease that has been largely eradicated in the U.S. But not very many people know that. No, rabies. Babies would be a good idea. Can I put you down for a dime? Hi, Stankley, how many sponsors so far? Zero. Come on, man. You gotta step it up. It's for a good cause. Jan called this morning and pledged $500. Isn't that your money? That is for a good cause. - Phyllis, how the rabies quilt coming? - Oh, it's coming. Oh, look at that! Three. Way to honor Meredith, Phyllis. You can't make me run. It is not a real charity. It's stupid, Michael and I'm not gonna do it. You didn't run for me when I thought I had skin cancer. I know that you're probably scared of people seeing your fat legs in shorts. Well, back in olden times, a large, fat person like this was a person of power. A person who had money, who could buy food. A person of respect, like the regional manager of the day. Whereas someone athletic and trim like myself was somebody who worked in the fields, and I was a peasant. I just don't wanna run. I didn't bring my sneakers or my clothes. You're gonna have to run or you're gonna be in a lot of trouble. It is not olden times anymore. I'm petrified of nipple chafing. Once it starts, is a vicious circle. You have sensitive nipples, they chafe. So they become more sensitive. So they chafe more. So I take precautions. Hey, Angela. I'm sorry about your cat. This is Sprinkles. She was my best friend. I kept her going through countless ailments. I asked Dwight Schrute to feed her once, and she is now deceased. This is Halloween last year. Just a couple of kittens. Out on the town. I'm having relationship problems. And since you're always having relationship problems, I thought you could give me some advice. What's wrong? I have this crazy thought that I know is crazy that maybe Dwight killed my cat. When I got home, Sprinkles' body was in the freezer where Dwight said he left her. But all my bags of frozen french fries had been clawed to shreds! Something's not right. The vet's doing an autopsy. Angela, I'm sorry. Did Roy ever killed one of your cats? I'm more of a dog person. So what's your strategy for this race? I'm gonna start fast. Then I'm gonna run fast in the middle. Then I'm gonna end fast. - Why won't more people do that? - 'Cause they're stupid. What? Oh, um, no, that's not - I mean, that wasn't - Yeah, that was, um I mean, I can see how it would seem a bit like we, uh How it looks like, um But nowadays, you can edit anything, right? I mean, you can edit anything to Look like, um, anything. - So - Yeah, I gave him a ride home - because - Right. We're dating. There it is. Uh, yeah. We haven't told anybody, but it's going really great. Right? It is going really great. Shut up! You're taking this out on me, but I was only the messenger. Oh, really? You'll feel better after the 5k. Exercise is good for depression. I am not depressed. I'm in grief! We have raised almost $700, most of it from me and Jan. When do they put that on the giant check? Or is that something that we write in later? Well, a giant check costs about $200 to make up. I have a print shop standing by, but What do you think, Michael? That's over 25% of our funds. It's a tough decision. I always imagined it with a giant check. Yeah, I mean, I personally am definitely on board for the giant check. Giant check it is. I don't know. On the other hand, it does leave less money for bat birth control. Bat birth control. This money's going to bat birth control, right? That's what you told me. You didn't contribute very much. I was also hoping to hand the giant check to a rabies doctor. - How's that going? - Not well. A doctor won't come out to collect a check for $700. Or $500 if we go with the giant check. - Which we are. - And also There is no such thing as a rabies doctor. How about a rabies nurse? - I don't think so. - You know what? I've actually seen ads for nurses that you can hire by the hour. For parties and bachelor events. That's possible. look into that. Great, it's gonna cost 200 bucks. And actually, more with tips. Maybe we should skip the ceremony and just set up a college fund for Meredith's son. Have you met that kid? I'm not going to college. not 5,000 miles. Come in. - My god! - What're you doing?! - You said, "come in!" - No, I didn't. Just - Oh, my god. - Please, get out. So I closed the door but the image of his - Baguette. - dangling participle still burned in my eyes. I can imagine. Come in. May I enter the room? Yes. Or "come in. " See how I did that? That's the way you should enter a room. You knock and wait for the all clear. You couldn't undress in the men's room? Yes. But I have an office, so why would I do that? On average, how many hours a day do you spend naked in your office? - Just ballpark. - European offices are always naked. - They're so not. - Besides, my shirt covered most of it. I only saw where it ended. - Gross. - That's not gross! It's the human body. What is your problem? Pam, you're an artist, right? Think of me as one of your models. Okay, you know what? I don't want this to detract from what we really need to think about today. It's not fair to people with rabies. And that's the point, right? Okay. Let's go have some fun all right. They say if you're nervous around someone, you should picture them naked. I do not recommend this strategy. Try picturing them with more clothes on. Or a funny coat. I'm sorry, is this a working office? And not a french beach? Okay, name, please? Creed Bratton, 75+ division. - You're over 75 years old? - 82 november 1st. - How much is the prize money? - There's no prize money. Well, is any of this real? Check that out. Look at me, I'm Toby! I'm stretching. I know what I'm doing. Why is he even here? So I heard that you were peeping on Michael. What? No, it was not I don't know what your deal is, but he's mine, okay? So hands off. Okay, everybody, listen up! Thank you for coming. Before we get started, I want to say a few words about this deadly disease called rabies. And I'd like you to take a look into the face of rabies. That should scare you. It scares me. You people need to educate yourselves. Meth: three americans every year die from rabies. Fact: four americans every year die from rabies. How many of you know someone who has been afflicted or affected by rabies? Show of hands. One, two, three too many to count. It is truly the silent killer. No, it is the foaming, barking killer. And it is something that Darryl! - What're you doing? - I give him a peanut. No, don't give him Just Did you hear anything I said? - Look how happy he is. - He's happy because he's insane. That's a perfect example of the kind of awareness we need to generate. Where's the nurse? - This is the reason we're here. - Hello, Michael. Oh, hey, I know you. - Elizabeth, right? - Yeah. Very cool you went back and got your degree. I would like you to accept this check for $340 made out to Science. Make sure that that gets into the right hands. You got it? Okay. Fettuccini Alfredo. Time to carbo load. Just remember, folks, it's not about winning, it is about finishing. On your marks! Get set! On your left! You're doing great, Michael. Look at you go! That's my boss! - Yeah, baby! - I'm fast. I'm very fast. I'm like Forrest Gump, except I am not an idiot. Oh, yes, I will work out today. I will work out a way to avoid running for a stupid cause. I've walked 2 marathons. Pretty sure I can handle a 5k. The key is drafting to eliminate wind resistance. Yeah. Oh, we're in last place. - Oh, would you look at that? - Darn it. Water! Water. - Water, babe? - No, no water for me. Not while rabies causes fear of water. Solidarity! Michael, that's irrational! Rabies victims have to live with an irrational hatred of water their entire lives. So least I could do. Oh, god. My nipples! It's starting. - Can we get another round? - Okay. Thanks. So we've got what? Another 20 minutes? More or less. That fettuccini is hitting my stomach like a rock. You got nothing to worry about. I put imodium in Toby's coffee before the race. Excellent! Simpsons! Wait, imodium or ex-lax? I'm making great time. Usually I have to take a bathroom break halfway through a race like this, but not today. Ooh, an estate sale. Want to go in? I'm really committed to winning. Okay, but what if I told you that all the money you spend here goes to preventing a disease already cured. - Yes. - That's what I thought. - Yeah. - Right? Let's do some good. You have reached the offices of Dunder Mifflin Scranton.  Currently the entire staff is out doing the Michael scott D.M.S.M.P.M.C. Rabies awarness pro-am fun run race  For the cure.  Leave a message.  Oh, god. Oh, Alfredo sauce. I'm getting a stitch. God! Watch the nipples, Kevin! Back off me. You're feeling better? No. Well, you look cute as a button. You've worked up quite a sweat. The vet's removing Sprinkles' organs right now and sending them to the lab. - I am a farmer, Angela. - What does that mean? When a farmer sees an animal that is in pain, that has no quality of life, that has no utility, a farmer does what city folk don't have the stomach to do. You did kill her! I sang her her favorite songs. You put her in my freezer! It was beautiful and gentle and respectful. I fed her antihistamines and she gradually fell asleep. She barfed them up in the freezer and tried to get out. I'm not responsible for that - It's nothing! - I'm robbing her! - It's nothing! - It's nothing! It's fine! How could you do that without telling me? I thought I was helping you. I expected a hug. I took care of that cat the best way I knew how. Cat heaven is a beautiful place, but you don't get there if you're euthanized. I know a great taxidermist. I'll pay to have her stuff. Well, he's not great, but he's pretty good. You don't understand. Take bat bites seriously. Don't get bit. Or we can have her buried out at the east field by mother. - Huh, Angela? - Don't touch me, Dwight. You like it? It's kind of designy and cool. It was $8. Oh, and I get to carry it. And the winner is Toby Flenderson! Have a seat. I'll write it down. Where are we? I don't know. Like five kilometers from the office. He couldn't have made it circle? I am not going to finish. I can't beat rabies. Nobody can beat rabies. Rabies has been around for a thousand years. I was a fool to think that I could beat it. - Pictures of the dog all around. - Yeah, probably What are you doing here? Did you come back for us or I can't finish. I feel so weak. I just - You're probably dehydrated. - What do you want me to do, Jim? A glass of water would be a start. There are people all over the world with all sorts of problems and afflictions and diseases. They're deformed and they're abnormal, and they're illiterate and ugly. Symphonies don't have any money. Public TV is bust. I can't do anything about it. I can't, you know There's just one of me, and there's thousand of them. And rabies wins. You are a downer. We were having a pretty nice day. I'm still having a nice day. - You are? - Yeah. Hey, Michael, look at this lamp. $8. That's a good deal. And Michael, you don't have rabies. And chances are you're not gonna get it anytime soon. So you don't really have to think about it too much. Pam, if everybody felt that way, nothing would get done. Yeah, but there's other better people out there who are helping. You just don't think I am capable of making a difference. I know you, Michael. I saw you naked. You don't You don't know me. You've just seen my penis. I can make a difference. Remember, I'm the one who started this whole thing off by hitting Meredith with my car. And I owe it to her to finish this G.D. 5k. Finishing that 5k was the hardest thing I have ever had to do. I ate more Fettuccine Alfredo and drank less water than I have in my entire life. People always talk about triumphs of the human spirit. Today, I had a triumph of the human body. That's why everybody was applauding for me at the end. My guts and my heart. And while I eventually puked my guts out, I never puked my heart out. And I'm very, very proud of that. Hey, Michael. Hey, Mer. - How you doing? - Better. It's ironic, isn't it? I mean, I'm in the hospital for not getting enough water. And you're in it for a disease that causes a fear of water. I'm in because you hit me with your car. But I want to say I heard you were trying really hard, so I'm not mad at you anymore. Thanks. I'm not mad at you anymore. Want to share? Sure. I'm not really sick. I'm good. You guys look amazing. Stanley, I thought you hated halloween. He wears it so he can sleep at his desk. - Who are you? - Carrie Bradshaw from Sex and the City. - I like your shoes. - Thank you. - Will you help walk me to the fax? - Sure. I got her, I got her, I can help you. - You look amazing. - Inappropriate. Thank you. - Who are you, Larry King? - Gordon Gekko. - From the insurance commercials. - Yeah Awesome. Let's put a smile on that face. Damn it, Creed! I've been up since 4:00! Sweet'stume, dude. Who are you supposed to be? Cool. You are a cat. We were looking for kitten. Give me one second. Jim Halpert. - Hey, New York. Happy Halloween. - Thanks. My costume's getting a lot of attention. So apparently no one dresses up for Halloween here. I wish I had known that before I used grease paint for my moustache. And I can't even take off my hat because then I'm Hitler. Wanna see a magic trick? I'm gonna make a pencil disa Disappear. Episode 5x05 "Employee Transfert" (1.00) OK, I think we are set. We have puzzles, string for cat's cradles. Burned this last night. A little road trip CD. Puppets. Look at all this stuff. It's only 7 hours. When corporate found out that we were dating, they decided they were gonna transfer Holly back to her old branch in Nashua, New Hampshire. Michael's taking a personal day to move me up. Road trip! Right? Breaker one-nine, copy Copy that, breaker. Those Duke boys are at it again. Do not touch my radio. - Kidding. - We're not doing anything. It's been a weird week since we found out I had to transfer. Michael wanted me to quit and get some job here in Scranton, I said "why don't you quit and get some job in Nashua?" He said "I asked you first." I said "first" at the same time he did. And then I said "jinx." And then we never talked about it again, and haven't been back to the conversation, so All right, everybody, I am out of here. - Jim, you are in charge. - I'll walk you out. You're quite a gentleman. You can let people go a couple of min early if you want. All right, we'll see. No. I'm off to New York. My brother Pete from Boston and my brother Tom from New Jersey are taking Pam and I out for lunch to celebrate the engagement. Or maybe to beat me up. I can never tell with those two. Good morning, temp. Good morning. Good morning, Dwight. Thought I'd go casual today. Good morning, everyone. Good morning. Hello. How are you, Phyllis? That's funny. Take that sweatshirt off! - Hey, buddy. - Andy. Remember when I jokingly yelled at you to take your sweatshirt off? Totally joking. But you should know those colors are sacred. Not that I care. But if you're not a Cornell man. - You probably shouldn't wear them. - No, I get it. I totally understand. And I just want to assure you that I mean no disrespect. You see, I'm applying. Come on, you think you could get into Cornell? Well, if someone who barely out-sells Phyllis can get in, I should be fine. - I'm sitting right here, Dwight. - I meant that as a compliment to you. As well as a slight to Andy. Cornell is a good school. And I want to better myself through higher education. If it makes Andy angry, so be it. I have to unpack this weekend, but maybe next weekend we go to the outlets! Mike, you driving every weekend? We're gonna switch back and forth, the driving. Sometimes we'll just meet in the middle. It'll be fun. Wait a sec. I love this song. Life is a highway I wanna ride it all night long If you're going my way I wanna drive you all night long If you're going my way Hey there. So, how do you think we're gonna do against Penn this year? Nathan Ford's arm looks pretty strong. Well, he's had a pretty good season so far Stop saying "we." You did not go to Cornell. You're just doing this to screw with me. Not so. Cornell is an excellent school. Without its agricultural program, we probably wouldn't have cabbage. At least not modern cabbage. I know it's an excellent school, Dwight. I went there. My blood runs big red. Someday we'll both get together in Comstock Hall and just laugh about all of this. Hey, future baby sis! How are you, Tom? Nice to see you. I asked Tom and Pete to come early so we could play a prank on Jim at lunch. Pretty awesome, right? I think they're into the idea. They're probably thinking, "that Pam Beesly, "she's the coolest sister-in-law on the planet. "She's the best. "The absolute best." OK, so, here's what I'm thinking. I'm gonna say that before ceramics class I took off my ring. And then when I changed back out of my smock, it wasn't in my pocket anymore, and I lost it. That's perfect. You know what'd be even more hilarious? Remember that thing we did when Jim was in high school with his girlfriend? That would be hilarious. We should totally dog her about being an artist, - never making any money. - That's awesome. Like she basically has a hobby for a job. So, not the ring, then? Not doing the ring, then. I think this is better. This is nice. It's fun. He hates it when we pick on his girlfriends. They came up with that idea really fast. - This trip is longer than I thought. - Yeah, it did look shorter I was having a nightmare. You were sleeping? - You were talking before. - Was I? Really? - Was I saying anything interesting? - Not really. All right, what's the scoop? How far? Four hours. Almost halfway there. - We're only halfway? - Halfway! You know what I want to do? I want to pull over and find a little bed and breakfast for when we meet in the middle. Emphasis on the bed. And the breakfast. Next exit isn't for five miles. Let's check there. - Hey, guys. - How are ya? Good to see you. Nice to see you again, Pam. Pam, I haven't seen you in so, so long. All right. So now we can sit and get comfortable. There's nothing out here, man. I don't know. I just imagined a hotel right here. A pool over here. Little breakfast place With really good bacon. Just Here we go. Fourth time's a charm. Life's like a road where you just One thing here and the next day back Sometimes you deal with it then you don't Sometimes you do what you want It's out there - Are you crying? - No. - Allergies? - No. - Did Darryl touch you? - What! No, Darryl did not touch me. Can we just keep going, please? - What's the matter? - It's not gonna work. - Sure it is. - There's too much distance. It's gonna work. It'll be fine. We've only been dating each other for a few weeks. Listen to me. - I like you so much. - I like you too. - And I've dated almost 4 women last - I've dated 4 guys last year too. No. In like, the last 10 years. I've dated almost 4 women. And you are so far above them it is stupid. Michael, don't. Don't. Don't make it harder than it has to be. That's what she said. Holly thinks that this relationship is over. Well, you know what, I am not gonna give up that easy. I'm going to make this way harder than it needs to be. Take that down. - Excuse me? - Take that down! I once dated a couple of guys from Cornell. They were really nice, gave me a ride home. I seriously doubt anyone from Cornell dated you. It's pronounced "colonel." Highest rank in the military. It's pronounced Cornell! It's the highest rank in the Ivy league. Andy, let's just talk about this man to man - after work. What do you say? - Fine. Good. - Good. - Can we That's big red bear! That's a bobble big red bear! God! If you leave on friday by 5:00, you'll be rolling in at midnight at best. And then sleep in saturday. That only leaves us less than 24 hours before you have to go back again. I will talk to you on the bluetooth the entire trip. So we're talking constantly all the way. I'll tell you everything that I see. Everything that I pass by. Things that I witness on the road. Maybe I'll see an accident one weekend. How long could we keep that up? - Years. - Years? Years of just a few hours every weekend? Here's my wish. I want you to meet a great guy, and I want you to be happy. - Thank you. - My wish has come true, incidentally. Because you've met me and you are happy. Clever, Mike. So Pam, how much money does an artist make after they leave art school? Not a lot of money in the arts, right? That's not really true. There's a lot to do with an art degree, actually. Maybe Pam should pay the check by drawing a picture on this napkin. That's a little rude. What's your deal? - Just having fun, Jimmy. - Right, Pam? You know what, I think we're a great couple. I think we're a classic couple. I think we're like Romeo and Juliet. I think we. go together so well. We're like peanut butter and jelly. - Don't you think? - I do. Then, don't do it. Please don't do this. Please don't do this. What's up? I just thought I'd try you. I'm thinking about that story where you ran into the girl you used to babysit. - I don't know what I'm gonna do! - Please call me back. - I'm not gonna be OK. - You will. No, I won't. I'm not strong. I'll go back to Jan, and I hate Jan. Oh, god! - You might be interested - What? Andy, I've been meaning to ask you, which a cappella group should I join? The Harmoniacs or the Do-Re-Migos? Assuming you had the voice to be in any of them, it's irrelevant. Because I called admissions, and it looks like I will be conducting your university interview. - That's a conflict of interest. - Yeah. Big one. So should I not let you in now, or do you want to do the interview, and then I won't let you in? - Interview. - Excellent. When the hourglass strikes 3:00, then in the room whence employees confer. - What? - The conference room. Who are your role models? If I had to put his chances into a percentage, I would say he has none-percent chance. So Dane Cook. Jack Bauer. And Eli Whitney. You're doing great. Life is a highway I wanna ride it all night This is my niece, Vanessa. She's a trumpeter. - And look at her. - Cute. It must be really fun for you and Marcy. She only knows how to play When the saints go marching in. - I love that one. - Yeah, but She doesn't think she's gonna be, like, a career musician, right? Here we go again. What's your deal today? Just saying, how many famous trumpeters can you name, besides Louis Armstrong? - Miles Davis. - One. - Chet something. - Half. - The point is that there are jobs - Dizzy Gillespie. Also good. and hobbies. I love baseball more than anything, but you don't see me trying to get on the Mets. Pete, you couldn't make the Mets. She's at Pratt. You play JV baseball. Will you lighten up a little bit? Just calling it like I see it. I don't know if I'm going to make any money with art. I mean, it's a very competitive field. But I've a professor who says that I've a lot of promise. And if I don't try now, I never will, so Guys, what is going on? We pranked you. It was Pam's idea. Pam was the mastermind. Got you. That was killer. I was so close to blowing it. Let's see how well you know your big red history. Bring it. Who was Cornell's 8th president? - Dale Raymond Corson. - I'm sorry, that's incorrect. Cornell's 7th president was, in fact, James A. Perkins. Comprehension skills sub-par. Interviewing skills sub-par. What are you writing? You can't even give Cornell your full attention. On the contrary, I'm helping Cornell by evaluating their interviewers. Nobody wants that to happen. Well, when they get my evaluation, we'll see if they're interested. Applicant is attempting to blackmail interviewer, showing low moral character. Interviewer is threatening applicant with an arbitrary review process. Applicant is wasting everyone's time with stupid and inane accusations. Interviewer has suspect motives. Applicant has a head shaped like a trapezoid. Interviewer has turned off applicant's interest in Cornell, and they are going to go to the vastly superior Dartmouth. Ever heard of it? I think I have everything I need. I think I have everything I need. You will be hearing from the Cornell Application Department. And you will not be pleased with the result. And your affiliation with Cornell will end completely!  will end completely. That is all, sir. You may go. There's another dolly in the truck, Mike. You could take more than a lamp. For the record, I wanted to go another direction. Which was way better. Well, I'll be the judge of that. What do you got? I lost my engagement ring in ceramics class. Left it in my smock. I had this whole thing where I go back to class, wrongly accuse another girl. Look, I even used makeup to put a ring around my finger. - You can hardly see, it's very subtle. - That is good. Thank you. Truthfully, anything would have been better than that prank. Text message from my brother. "Pam cool. Welcome to the family." How about at Thanksgiving we prank Tom about being bald? - This is the last of it. - That's mine, actually. - Maybe put it back in the truck. - You're not staying? You know, I have some things I need to do this weekend. I just remembered, so I'll just ride back with you. - But you want me to put it back. - I'll be down in just a second. So I think I'm gonna go back with Darryl. - Bye. - OK, bye. I know it's hard, Mike. Break-ups hurt. We didn't break up. Looked like it. Sometimes when I'm down like this, it helps to sing the blues. That's a really pretty song. No, no, check it out. Look. Wanna do that? That's when you hit me with what's getting you down. No, wait, you You supposed to Never mind. I thought I'd come in casual today. Man, I'm hungry. Anyone else feel like a beet? - Where did you get those? - What, these? Bernard Farms. Best beets in the state. I see what you are doing. But I do not know where you are going with this. You will. As soon as you visit my new beet farm. You're supposed to cook these, aren't you? Cornell. So, coasting time. It's officially over. Big changes are coming, and they're coming fast. And if you don't like them, this is called a door, you can walk right through it, all right? I'm not here to be your friend. I like my life outside of this place. I live to leave at 5:00. Change number one: Darryl. Per your request, the company is sending you to business school at night. Full ride, deal with it. Seriously? Stone cold seriously. They are trying to figure me out, and I don't like it. Once they figure me out they start to tell me what I want to hear. And I need to quickly figure out who's a good worker, and who is simply a good mind reader. Because as soon as I'm hearing what I wanna hear, I'm not gonna care. Toby. You're getting a new chair. - Nice. - Don't thank me. Hey, don't thank me, guy. Okay? And I don't care if you like it. These sound like good ideas, why wouldn't we like them? I don't care what your favorite flavor is. Here's a bowl of ice cream, you either like it or you don't. That's my attitude right now in this room, that's my attitude on ice cream Thursdays. All right? Clear? Any questions? This all sounds great to me. But I could see how some people might think that they're bad. I don't know what to think. That is a-- An astute observation, Kevin. Kev's got me pegged. It blows away Vermont in the fall. Snap, for real? - Not even-- - Good morning, Deangelo. - Hold on, Pam. - Okay. And if you're really serious, you should go in the spring. - 'Cause of the flowers. - No. Because the entire state smells like earth. Dogwoods, or just the earth? Yes, Pam. Hey, well, good morning. I think I have good news for you today. I found your new executive assistant. My friend Carla. She's got great experience, we even considered making her Cece's godmother. But she had this boyfriend at the time. But here's her resume. Put it with the rest. Okay. Hey, dudes. Hey. Hey. - Oh, my God, he hates me. - No, he doesn't. You just get so nervous and hyper around him. I know. Every time there's a silence, you're brain's, like Is that what he tells you at your little inner-circle meetings? Careful, there is no inner circle. Oh, there's an inner circle. Oh, yeah. There is no inner circle. Deangelo just prefers to delegate a few things to a few guys. Jim only says that because he's in the inner circle. I also say that, because I am also in the inner circle. Did you get that, ma? Your boy, Kevin Malone, is in the inner circle. Which doesn't exist. There he is. Got you a coffee. Oh, wow, thank you, that was so kind of you. Not a coffee guy I take it, huh? It's just that I own the coffee shop. So once you've seen sausage being made, all you wanna do is make sausage. 'Cause it's so much fun. Listen, I've got a sixer. "Automatic for the people," on the jukebox. Let's hit the park after sundown, come on. Pick up some sausage if you want. I think you'll find what you're looking for over there. No matter how many times I reach out to Dwight, he doesn't seem to want anything to do with me. It reminds me of my relationship with my son. Except there, I'm the Dwight. Who's the biggest client in the state? I say we go get 'em, whatever it takes. Huh, what do you guys say? - Yes. - Yeah. - Huh, right? - Let's do it. Or my other idea, Yeah, I say that we just go for it. Whoa, is that ball lighter than usual? Is that a Chinatown knock-off? That's "toys r' us" I think. No, that's definitely a knock-off. You can feel the center of gravity is off. Feel that, what do you think? Oh, yeah, totally. Jim, you got ripped off big time. Deangelo! See what I did there? Oh, that's what you need to do. Just add a little English. The British are coming. - Yes. - Deangelo's open! Hey, Ry. Your department's killing it, baby. Hey! My pleasure, my treasure. Keep it up. The problem with having "it," or, "the x-factor," or whatever it is you wanna call it, is that it's impossible to put into words what you're bringing to the table. So to make things simpler for Deangelo, I just, without lying, strongly implied that I'm Kelly's supervisor. It's not even that much of a stretch. She pretty much does whatever I say. What? I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Why should I pretend that you are my boss? Because what would you have done in that situation, Kelly? I'll tell you what I would have done for you. I'd lie for you. Yeah, but you lie all the time. You lie for no reason. Ryan, you just like to lie. I'd die for you too. You really would? Hey, Kelly Kapoor, if I don't have those call logs on my desk, we're just gonna have to evaluate your future at the company. - Sure thing, Mr. Howard. - Whoo. Glad he's not my boss. Ooh, you're the best, thank you. You know I have a cousin who cracked the secret formula for a certain popular cola that I shall not name. So I've never had to buy it. True story. I just drink my cousin's. Congratulations on your one cousin. I have 70-- Each one better than the last. You know what? Straight up, why don't you like me? I'm just not a suck-up like everyone else around here, okay? I do my job well, so why don't you just leave me alone, and let me do it. Okay? Oh, no. - Wha--? - Okay? I'm gonna win you over. No, you're not. - Yes, I am. - No. - Oh, yes. - No. - Yes. - No. - No. - Yes! - Yes! - No! - No. - Yes. - Yes, yes, yes, yes! - No, no! Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! Uh-oh, this former administrative assistant misspelled "administrative," and "assistant." The winner. Under "special skills," Mr. Don finer put "juggling." What's wrong with juggling, Darryl? I'm a big juggler. I actually perform a motivational juggling routine. - Seriously? - Oh, yeah. I'd do it for you here but, uh, what would you say this room is? It's a little cramped. How many square feet out there? Oh, I think it's 18 hundo. Give or take. Sorry, gang. Thought my juggling stuff was in the trunk of my car, but it's not. Oh, no, do you think it was stolen? I got you covered, boss. Used to play with the parabolas myself. Got some extra balls. Hey! Whoa! Sorry, I never touch another juggler's instruments. You know, we're all here, I've got the music cued. Why don't I just do my routine without the juggling balls. Prepare to go into the danger zone. Oh, wow, you weren't kidding. No, never. Can someone please throw me a fifth ball? If you dare. Incoming! And we're on. Remember, nothing's impossible. - Phyllis, where's Phyllis? - Here. Do you believe in me, Phyllis? - Yes. - 'Cause I believe in you. Oh, okay. Feel that connection? Don't move your head, please, thank you. Aah! Big hand for Phyllis. That took a lot of guts. I'm Deangelo Vickers, thank you so much. Hope you learned something. - Whoo! - Whoo! He didn't drop a single ball. Look. I'm juggling eggs and bowling balls. I'm juggling with one hand. No hands. What could he possibly stand to gain from a fake juggling routine? What could he possibly stand to gain from a real juggling routine? How can you keep defending him? He's good at his job, and I like working for him. Of course you do, Jim. You're a man. Deangelo is a huge sexist. Whoa, whoa, whoa. I think if he was a sexist I'd be able to tell. I took a crapload of women's studies courses at Cornell. And I wrote my own companion piece to the vagina monologues called the penis apologies. So I know a thing or two. Okay. Then how about I'm the head of the accounting department, but he only ever talks to Kevin. What about Pam and Kelly? Also department heads, but has he ever met with you? Or even asked you to do anything? Huh, how could I not see it? You're so right. Why don't you talk to him about it? And say what? Hey, Deangelo, are you shy or just a sexist? Why don't you just tell him how his actions are being perceived by the women in this office. And if he doesn't listen then he can kiss his penis goodbye. Snip snip. Am I right, girls? Hey, do you have a second? Yeah, I got tons of time, this job's a joke. So what's up? Um, really, it's nothing. I was just talking to Angela. - Mm-hmm. - And she was-- - Hey. Saw Jim come in, are we meeting? Yeah, sure, let's make it a meeting. If it's all right, can I just have, like, one minute alone, just to go over-- What's the big secret? Why are you even whispering? Come on, it's the guys. I know, just the guys. Well, maybe that's part of the problem, I think. So what happened was, I was talking to some of the department heads. Right. Uh, some of the female department heads. - Uh-oh. - Yeah. - Right? - Hot. Maybe there's a vibe out there with certain members of the office that you are a little sexist, or-- - Damn! - Whoa. Whoa, wait. Are you serious? Who feels this way? - Oh, like, nobody, it was-- - Uh, Pam? Was it Pam? Oh, my gosh. That sounds like Pam. Yeah. You know how she gets. Deangelo, she can get really bitchy. Kevin, wah-wah. - Guys. - Hold on. Doesn't matter who, okay? I'm just happy that Jim brought it to my attention. Because honestly, I had no idea. - That's awesome. - Thank you. Mom, Ryan's taking us out to dinner tonight. No, no, he's not gonna stand us up like he did last time. He won't ever stand us up again. So I am the new customer service supervisor. When deangelo's around. - And I'm also a very dutiful boyfriend when-- - All the time. - All the time. Erin, do you mind running down to the lobby and bringing up my brand-new executive assistant? Absolutely. Hey, who'd you end up hiring? I'm glad you asked, Jim. Because apparently there's a rumor running around here that I'm a sexist. I can't work here effectively if you guys think I'm something that I'm not. I'm not a sexist. Raise your hand if you have a vagina. Raise your hand if someone you love has a vagina. Yeah, yeah, okay. Just about everyone. What about deangelo's hand? Oh, wow. He's got 'em both up. Yeah. Uh-huh, yeah. So it bothers me when I hear that there's gossip around here that I treat women lesser than men. Okay? Frankly, we all look a little ridiculous when that happens. I'm not a feminist, but I think that the men in this office are being given chances that the women aren't. Dwight. What's your take? What's the argument here? NBA, WNBA. One is a sport, one is a joke. I love sports, I love jokes. Room for all. Man, your smart. Oh, hey, hi. Hello. Hi. Welcome. Uh, everyone. I'd like you to please welcome Jordan garfield. This is everyone. Hello. So Jordan, uh, where did you work before? Uh, a law office? No, anthropologie. "We don't have this and that size." Pretty--pretty lame. - Hm. Lame? You worked at anthropologie? - Yes. - That's, like, my dream job. How did you even get that job? Well, I, um-- You chose this job over that job? Okay, okay, back to work, Kelly. We have a lot to get done today. So, um, is this your first office job then? - Yeah. - Yup. Wow. No corporate experience whatsoever. I didn't want anyone with any bad habits. Jim, you coming? Oh, yeah, did he text us? Yeah. No! Jim, what are you doing? Get in there. This is not the time to take a stand, at least he likes one of us. He didn't text me. Yes! I'm in. Andy, what are you doing? Uh, I'm going in to the belly of the beast. I'm gonna infiltrate and change from within. What's up, man cave! - Just go in. - Hm? Just go in, he probably just forgot to text you. Internally for office use. Where do we get our paper from? Do we go and--do we have that system? Don't worry, the first day's always the hardest. Yeah. - Hey, Jim. - Yeah. Can I help you? Nope, just Okay. So, he kicked you out of the inner circle, huh? No, there is no inner circle. Dwight? Deangelo wanted me to ask you if there's anything I could help you with? Really? Anything? Do you need anything? Deangelo? Tell your whore to leave me alone! Okay, I do not wanna waste your time, so I will keep this brrrrrrrrief! Now, word on the street is mercy hospital. Back on the market. Deangelo would like you to put together a sales pitch for next week. Deangelo has also recently learned about the barnacle project, which is a non-profit organization based in mystic, Connecticut, that assists in the scraping of barnacles-- So this is my life. Until I win the lottery. Or Pam finally writes that series of young adult books. So one afternoon while walking home from school, quirky tenth grader Becky Walters finds a wounded Pegasus in the woods. And she becomes "the horse flyer." Hey, Kelly, that's the last time I'm gonna talk to you about your paycheck, okay? We pay you a fair salary here and if you're only here for the money, maybe you shouldn't be here at all. No one likes a money-grubber. I'm sorry, Mr. Howard. I apologize for grubbing for money-- I can't do this, I can't do this. I--I'm sorry, I just can't do it. Deangelo, Ryan is not my boss, okay? Frankly, he hasn't had a real job here in years. Oh, that's hilarious, Kelly. No, he's just a big fraud, Deangelo. He's like Rango. He doesn't work here, basically, just like the way Rango didn't save those animals. It was just a big misunderstanding. Is this true, Ryan? I did not see Rango. Okay, I don't have time for this "he said, she said." He's not saying anything! It's too murky. I like Ryan, you seem kind of hysterical to me. Ryan's your supervisor. Let's just leave it that way. But it's not fair, I've been working here for such a long ti-- Close call. Okay, why don't you just finish this up and leave it on my desk and I will see you at your place around 2:00 A.M., huh? Oh-ho-ho, yeah! Oh, angry, angry dunk. Hey. It sounds like you guys are having a lot of fun, but it's really loud and some of us are trying to work, so Okay. Do you think you could do it a little more quietly? Well, that's gonna be tough because we're getting a dunking clinic from magic Jordan himself. Oh, you mean, uh, Michael Jordan? Total brain-burp. I'm no MJ. Please. I can do his dunk, from the free-throw line though. Damn! Mad respect from a brother! The man is paying me to take Chinese. I will say what I need to say. And soon, I will say it in Chinese. Okay, well, it's just really loud. Okay. We'll keep that in mind. All right, ladies. Back to the game. Do it! And Jim. Come on in. You're back in. You know what? Instead of a game, why don't we do an exhibition? Love to see that dunk of yours. Yeah, we'll set that up one day. Today. Now, maybe. 'Cause we have a hoop downstairs. And a real ball, so you don't have to mime it. Yeah, I don't know. Why not? Only because no one has called NASA to request a lift-off. - Let's go downstairs, okay? - Let's definitely do that. - Let's do it. - Pass. If I wanted to see a pissing contest I'd lock Mose in the chicken Coop. Damn it, Dwight, enough! Get your ass downstairs, or find a new place to sell paper! Okay, a little about me. I respond to strong leadership. - All right, there you go. - Seems a little close. You're sure that's the real foul line? So you need me to move it in? Nah, that's 15. Yeah. Okay. And, uh, you know what, to make it interesting, Jordan, why don't you sit underneath the basket? - Seriously? - Yeah, come on. I'll dunk over you, best seat in the house. - I don't--I don't think I can do that. I'm holding your jewelry. Right, yeah. Okay, fair enough. Kevin, you do it. - Yes, okay. - Why don't you? Here? Someone wanna sit in Kevin's lap? - Angela? - No. - Oscar? - No, thank you. Okay, Jimmy, this is for you, to show you that anything is possible. - Fantastic. - All right? - Yup. - This is also for the troops. Doctor is in! Now what? - Deangelo? - Tablab. Oh, my God, are you all right? Erin, would you call 911 please? Who should I say is calling? Erin. Chea three thead twa to bar. Scoince? Paunch and loud. Paunch says to barter how's gonna tha. Barte sayce four tha pa. Everybody tine, everybody tha. Everybody tha. Dra tweb. Yeah. Dra sweb. Treasure, yeah, I get it. Okay, we're gonna work on treasure. Andy's coming back today. Andy's coming back today. Ha! Andy's coming back today. David Wallace sent him on an outward-bound wilderness adventure for a whole month to make him more decisive and confident. He sent his own son too. And the counselor said they both grew up big time. How was my summer? It was pretty mixed. I invented a new power drink made of beet run-off. Mmm. Mmm! So that's really good. But I got some disappointing medical news. Mr. Schrute, the results are in. - You're not the father. - I told you. Oh, God! Oh, my God! Oh, what a summer. An emotional roller coaster. I ran over a turtle in the parking lot But then I saved him by gluing his shell back together. But I'm not that good at puzzles Oh, that piece doesn't go there. Shh. So I patched him with stuff from around the office. But I couldn't get the pieces to fit right. Then, one day, while I was reaching for the glue, I crushed his shell again. But I rebuilt him even better that time. But it turned out the turtle was already dead. Probably when I ran over him the first time. For us, um Nothing new, really. The kids are great. You are really good at modesty. She's a genius. She painted this incredible mural in the kids' room. There's a hippo leading a parade of 500 children-- Okay, well, you had that interesting thing. Oh yeah. Yes, Jim's friend is starting a new company based on this idea that Jim had when they were back in college. It's sports marketing, basically, but the athletes are partners. And he wanted Jim to be a partner too. In Philly, so that doesn't really work for the family. But watch this guy make a billion dollars off my idea. He said if it takes off, he's gonna buy us a new car. An Altima or better. Kelly Kapoor is gone. Her fiance, Ravi, was hired as a Pediatrics Professor at Miami University. I don't need 'em anymore. I am going to Miami, bee-yotches, to hang with Lebron James and Gloria Estefan. Miami University, in Ohio. On her last day, Kelly was still a little confused about it. - Enjoy the snow, losers. - I'm so happy for you, Kelly. Shortly after Kelly left, Ryan quit and also moved to Ohio, for what he claimed were unrelated reasons. I've actually done a lot of market research, and it turns out that Southwestern Ohio is going to be the next Silicon Valley. They call it the Silicon Prairie. It's a big university town, and, uh It's not garbage, it's my clothes. And that was our summer. - We good? - Yeah. Thanks. Don't you guys have everything? I mean, it's just a paper company. Yeah, well, we're more following you guys to see how you turn out. Oh, yeah, I guess we were kind of dramatic in the beginning. Well, I don't think anything's gonna change in our lives now. With work and two kids, there's just-- Nothing interesting's gonna happen to us for a long, long time. Andy's coming back today. Hey, uh, does anybody know where we throw these out? Oh, my God. - It's called a garbage can. - Helpless. There's two new guys back there with me now. They're in their 20s, and we really get along. Looking good. Just three single guys getting into trouble. They're like the new Jim and Dwight. Oh, yes, yes. I see that. Perfect. Hey, new Jim, come sit on my face. No, thank you. My name's Pete. No, Pete is not the new Jim. The only thing we have in common is that neither of us wants to sit on Meredith's face. And if that makes him the new Jim, then every human being in the world is the new Jim. Andy's here! Old Dwight, new Dwight, Andy's here. New Jim, Tuna, Andy's here. Pam, he's here. Hey! Ahh. Wow, I thought about this place a lot when I was on solo. Three days on a mountain, it'll change you. The things we think we need. Clocks. Yeah, right. It sounds amazing. Tell us all about it. What are you still doing here? Wonderful, thanks. You know, I had this really funny dream during outward bound that you died. Brilliant. See me in my office later. The new guys. All right. - Clark and, um - Pete. Da da da da In Outward Bound, it was all about nicknames. They called me Iceman. You will be called "Plop." What-- Why? 'Cause you're always taking dumps. No, I'm not. Come on, everybody defecates. Relax, Plop. You will be called "Fart" - because you fart all the time. - I love it. Actually, Andy, we call this one "Dwight Jr." No, I prefer "Fart." No, Dwight Jr. Infinitely better. You guys look exactly alike. Dwight, go stand next to him. - This is insane. - I don't see it. I don't either. I don't either. Whoa. Mind blown. It's like father and son. It's Dwight, you cool if we call him Dwight Jr.? Yes. Yes, I am. That's okay. - Dwight Jr. - Ha. In a way, it's like I have a son. And who knows? Maybe some day they'll hire someone who looks like a younger version of him. And then I'll have a grandson. Well, I need to give my cat up for adoption. - Mmm. - The one who uses the doorbell, or the one with the Mexican hat, or the one with the rain galoshes, or the one that you let go around naked? Angela's cats are cute. So cute that you just want to eat 'em. But you can't eat cats. You can't eat cats, Kevin. - No, the one with the long hair and the denim pants-- Comstock. - Oh. - Okay, look. He's such a special kitty. I just want to find him a good home. He loves those pants. I'll take him. Please. After the turtle? I am enormously proud of what I did for that turtle! Oscar. Oscar. Will you take him? No, I'm a dog person. If you pray enough, you can change yourself into a cat person. Those guys always turn back, Angela. David, outward bound was incredible. I was the best at slacklining. I ate a worm. Glad to hear it. You sound really confident and decisive. Hey, you wanted to see me? Yeah. I gotta go, David. Why is Nellie still here? You can only fire Nellie for cause. Hmm. Then I will make up a cause. Except you just told me you were gonna make it up. Now, if she sues, I have to testify against you. Then forget I just told you that. I can't. I took a course at the Weintraub Memory Academy. Sat next to this woman named Beverly Brook. She had a Greek salad for lunch. See what I mean? Now I know why Michael hated you so much. No, he didn't. Good boy. Getting big and strong. Snack foods! Yep. Body by cheez-it. Ah, humor. I have it too. Oh, boy, I got a couple of tickets to The Slayer concert ten months from now. You interested? I think I'm busy that night. Oh, or I would. Mmm, okay, well, we're both just kind of learning as we go, aren't we? Learning what? Just how this is gonna be. You know. You have a beautiful round head. Okay. So what kind of farming you into, huh? More of a fruit man or a root man? Hey, is this-- is this code for, like, gay stuff? 'Cause if so, that's totally fine. Like, I'm fine with it. But you know, you should know that I'm into the ladies. Spoken like a true root man. Hey, you know, if you're ever swamped, I can make some sales calls for you. - My calls? - So could you give me a list of all your clients, or just the leads that you haven't had time to pursue yet? You want a list of my clients? You want my leads? Yeah, I'll just give it a glance. - Okay. - I'll give it a read. Yeah, with my leads, and stuff like that. Yeah. 'Cause you're interested in going into sales. - I am. - Wow, that's great. - Yeah. - That's great. Okay, good. Let's talk about that, okay? - Okay. - You're not getting my clients. Nice try. Paranoid? I'm not familiar with the word. And I really don't have time to learn new words right now, okay? A pudgy 22-year-old is trying to take my job. Jim, get ready for the battle of your life. Done. Explain. The new guys-- Dwight Jr. is after my job. Yeah, there is a shark hiding inside that adorable little cherub. Oh, now I get what Pete was talking about at the sales meeting yesterday. Wait, sales-- What sales meeting? The new guys called one. The new guys called a sales meeting? Clark ended the whole thing with a karate demonstration. Did you know there was a belt above black? There's no belt above black. - Is there a belt above black? - You should ask him. It's a color you would never expect. Too easy. Attention, everyone. Comstock is still available. Oscar has been flirting with adopting him, but still hasn't given me a definite yes or no. - Definitely no. - Fine. For any interested candidates, I will be conducting My ideal situation would be an independently wealthy cute couple with a strong commitment to education. Black or white-- I'm fine with either. But not both. Listen, you're in this, but you need to wow me, okay? I wanted to talk to you about our working relationship this year. It's going to be terrible. Not necessarily. No, I'm going to make sure that it is. And if it isn't, I will take immediate action to rectify that. Now, I don't like to throw around the "B" word, but I'm gonna be a huge bitch to you. Now, this is called slacklining. I set up the old slackline to teach the office the skills of focus and discipline. Or in the case of certain individuals, the skills of humiliation and looking really dumb. If you make it all the way across, your confidence will soar. But if you Toby out-- Aah! Aah! Then you'll feel like a real Nellie. How 'bout a hand? Screw those guys. Now, these are my actual outward bound counselors, Rafe and Feather. - Iceman. - That's me. The powder is for your protection. Feather has permanent athlete's foot. Feather, show them how you dance upon the line of slack. You, uh-- You a sports guy? - Sure. Uh, boxing, tennis. - Oh. Any team sports? Nascar. The Amazing Race. Phillies fan, though, right? You mean horses? No, like ba-- baseball. The baseball team. I like the Red Sox. I'm from Vermont, so Okay. Good talk. I have nothing in common with Plop. All right, who's next? Nellie. Oh, I would rather watch you and your talented friends. Nonsense. Get up here. - Go ahead. - Come on. Uh, you gonna wear your heels? I'm very self-conscious about my feet. Okay. Sure. There you go. Atta girl. Hey, all right. Whoa! You suck. All right, who's next? Darryl. This seems like the kind of thing white people with dreadlocks do. Dwight Jr., this looks like your speed. Uh, I guess I can give it a shot. Yeah, come on. Get up here. - Just hop on up. - Okay. Focus on the horizon. Whoa! Look at this guy. I've always been good at anything that required balance. My doctor says I have gigantic inner ears. Go, Dwight Jr. - Yes! - Boo! Unimpressed. It's a tightrope for babies. Boo. All right, let's see you do it. All right, let me show you how a real man walks across a flaccid cord. Oh, ho ho ho! Who ordered the hot apple fail? Okay, I am just getting started, okay? You got this. This is all you. Oh! - Oh - Got ourselves a yard sale. - Oh. - Whoa. Balls and face. - It's not a race, Dwight. - Aah! - Oh! - Well, it's official-- Old Dwight is lame, and new Dwight is cool. That's not true. Just give me another chance. - But your mouth is-- - This is a bloodbath. All right, I'm calling this. - What? - It's enough of this. Everyone, let's go back to work. This is a stupid activity. I would be embarrassed to be good at it. Get-- Idiots! Slacklining. Big deal. Untie that rope, give it to a couple of pigtailed school girls, let them start jumping with it while chanting a rhyme and giggling about boys. Doesn't seem so macho now, does it? It's a jump rope! Dwight! Pam? Hey, I'm up here. Up the ladder. Come on. What are you doing? Come here. I'll show you. Why do you want this cat? Um, I don't want it, really. How would you support the cat? What are your ambitions? I want to start my own business. I want to be a millionaire. Lots of things-- Travel. Make the world a better place. Earn an MBA at night. Have you taken any concrete steps? Well, I'm still just fitting in here. You know, getting used to the new job. - Mm-hmm. - But definitely on the agenda. But that is a good idea, Angela. I should make a list. Oh, come on, Pete. God, that's just sad. If he doesn't watch himself, he's gonna be here for years doing nothing. Wow, maybe Pete is the new Jim. Do you see how the trapeze completely surrounds the wire? That means it is literally impossible for anyone to fall off. So you will merely sit below and be my counterweight as I pedal across the parking lot to that telephone pole, - I will? - You will. Yeah, we weigh about the same, wouldn't you say? - Sure, if you weigh 105 pounds. - So you'll do it? - No. - Come on! This will be the only thrill of your boring life. Dwight, you may find this hard to believe, but I love my boring life - Come on. - Exactly the way it is. - No, Pam. - Yes. And there's nothing you can say that would get me to run the slightest risk of losing it. - Please? Please, Pam? - Find someone else. I don't know, ask Phyllis. I can't use Phyllis. Are you kidding me? The moment she steps off this bar I'll be launched into space. God, you're so insensitive! Why are you getting rid of it? Allergies. - Your husband? - No, the baby. Please, it's my husband's favorite cat. He's broken up about it. It's the only time I've seen him cry other than our wedding night. You know what? I will take Comstock. Really? Oh, Oscar, thank you! I'll come by after work and pick him up. Yay! Oh, poor Robert. He won't get to say good-bye. He has this business dinner tonight. Oh, c'est la vie. Please don't teach the cat French. Yeah, good news. Tonight, when you come over for dinner, you can play with your old buddy Comstock. You ready? Yeah. You know what? I'll meet you down there. I've just gotta make a quick call. Okay. Okay. All right Oh, God. Attention, employees of Dunder Mifflin. Everyone thinks the new guys are so cool 'cause they can slackline. Ooh! Hey, Clark, this is what a real salesman looks like. They say that you only live once, and I'm about to prove it. - Dwight Schrute! - Dwight! Hey, man, it's Halpert. Did you go to the other guy yet? Great. Don't. I'm in. Yeah, yep, I'm all in. Okay, talk to you soon. Bye. Yeah! Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! - Call somebody. - Hang on! Hang on! Hold on, Dwight! In the parking lot today, there was a circus. The copier did tricks on the high wire. A lady tried to give away a baby that looked like a cat. There was a Dwight impersonator and a Jim impersonator. A strongman crushed a turtle. I laughed and I cried. Not bad for a day in the life of a dog food company. Crap, sorry, Nellie. Once again, I understand that old habits die hard, but if everyone would kindly walk their refuse to the trash bins, instead of tossing them, then we would-- Oh Swish. Oh, it's nothing to do with me. I just happen to be sitting near to where the bins are. There are two things that I am passionate about-- Recycling and revenge. Flook.
