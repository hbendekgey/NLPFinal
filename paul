Pam. Pamela. Pam-elama-ding-dong. - Making copies. - I'm not making any copies. Let's go. Messages. Stat. Lots to do, lots to do. Information superhighway. - Nothing new. - Lay them on moi. What? - There's nothing new. - That's not what you said earlier. Do you want me to repeat the messages that I gave you before for the The most sacred thing I do is care and provide for my workers, my family. I give them money. I give them food. Not directly, but through the money. I heal them. Today, I am in charge of picking a great new health care plan. Right? That's what this is all about. Does that make me their doctor? Um Yes, in a way. Yeah. Like a specialist. So, which health plan have you decided on? I am going to go with the best, Jan. I am going to go with the one with the acupuncture, therapeutic massage, the works. None of the plans have acupuncture. Have you looked at them closely? I think it was you who didn't look closely enough at the Gold Plan. The Gold Plan? I'm not even on that plan. - Well, I'd recommend it. It's very good. - Michael. - You gotta crack these things open. - We're doing this to save money. So you just need to pick a provider and choose the cheapest plan. Well, that is kind of a tough assignment. - Um It won't be popular around the orifice. - It's your job. Well, it's a suicide mission, you know. - Michael Maybe I mean - There there Sometimes a manager like yourself has to deliver the bad new to the employees. - I do it all the time. - When have you ever done that? I'm doing it right now. To you. Last night on Trading Spouses Have you seen it? - No. I have a life. - Interesting. What's that like? - You should try it sometime. - Wow. But then who would watch my TV? That is - Your problem. - Jimbo! Ha-ha-ha! There's a decision that needs to be made, and I'm having a busy day. So I'm going to let you pick a health care plan for our office and then explain it to your co-workers. - Gosh. - Yeah! That is a great offer. Thank you. I really think I should be concentrating on sales. - Really? - Yeah. I just don't think this is the kind of task that I am going to do. You know who would be great for this? Any time Michael asks me to do anything, I just tell him that Dwight should do it. Yes. I can do it. I'm your man. Right now, this is just a job. If I advance any higher in this company, then this would be my career. And, er Well, if this were my career, I'd have to throw myself in front of a train. OK. First, let's go over some parameters. How many people can I fire? - None. You're picking a health care plan. - We'll table that for now. Two, I'll need an office. The conference room should be fine. You can use the conference room as a temporary workspace. Yes. I have an office. Bigger than his. - No, you cannot use it. - OK, it's a workspace. Temporary workspace. You can use it. Thank you. If Dwight fails, then that is strike two, and good for me for giving him a second chance. And if he succeeds, then no one will be prouder than I am. I groomed him. I made him what he is today. Unless he fails, and we've talked about that already. What did I do? I did my job. I slashed benefits to the bone. I saved this company money. Was I too harsh? Maybe. I don't believe in coddling people. In the wild, there is no health care. In the wild, health care is, "Ow, I hurt my leg. I can't run. "A lion eats me and I'm dead. " Well, I'm not dead. I'm the lion. You're dead. There's no dental, there's no vision, there's a $1,200 deductible. - Dundler Mifflin. This is Pam. - Pam, Michael Scott. How's tricks? Where are you? Oh, I am in my office. I am swamped. I have work up to my ears. I'm busy, busy, busy. Can't step away. I just wanted to check in and see how everybody's doing. - Everybody cool out there? - Actually, people are really unhappy. Dwight sent around this memo and people are freaking out Pam! Whoa! I'm sorry. I gotta go. I'm getting a call. No, you're not. I have to make a call after I finish my work. You know what? Just don't let anybody in my office under any conditions. I'm just too busy. Too swamped, you know? I am unreachable. I am incommunicado, capisce? - OK. - Thank you. Oh, here we go again. - Gotta go. I have to take this. - Still no one calling. - Dwight, what - Knock, please. - Please knock. This is an office. - It says "workspace". - Same thing. - Then why did you write "workspace"? Just knock. Please? As a sign of respect for your superior. - You are not my superior. - Then why do I have an office? - I thought it was a workspace. - OK. Dwight. Are you really in charge of health care? - Yes. And my decision is final. - This is a ridiculously awful plan. - You cut everything. - Times are tough, Pam. Deal with it. - Did you cut more than you had to? - Sure. Why? You work here. Don't you want good insurance? Don't need it. Never been sick. Perfect immune system. If you've never been sick, then you don't have any antibodies. I don't need them. Superior genes. I'm a Schrute. And superior brainpower. Through concentration, I can raise and lower my cholesterol at will. - Why would you raise your cholesterol? - So I can lower it. He literally won't come out of his office. He's gotta come out sometime. - To go to the bathroom! - Kevin. That's inappropriate. - Michael, can I talk to you? - I would love to but I'm busy. Rain check? Michael. Michael, please. Can we talk to you about this memo? What? Which memo? Dwight's health care memo. - Is it a good plan? - It's a great plan. - It saves the company a fortune. - It's a pay decrease. - Michael, he made huge cuts. - Cuts? What? - Dwight, did you make cuts? - Yeah, you said No! You know what? I said nothing specific because I was so busy. Why don't you go in there and find these people a plan that will work for them? - I can handle that. - OK? All right. Do we feel good? All right. Good. Plus, there's some other good news. Today, at the end of the day, I will have, for all of you, a big surprise. OK? So hang in there, and I will see you at the end of the day. Right? - This is not good. - It's ridiculous. - Did you talk to him? - What was that? You let him walk all over you. It's just pathetic. - What are you guys talking about? - Nothing, Kevin. Do I know what the surprise is? Hell, no! It doesn't matter. They're not unhappy anymore. They're out there thinking, "Wow, my boss really cares about me. "He has a surprise. He's cool. "What a great guy. I love him. "I love him. " OK, everyone. Gather round. Step forward. I believe that some of you are unhappy with my plan. So what I'd like you to do is to fill this out and write down any diseases you have that you might want covered and I'll see what I can do. We can't write our diseases down for you because that's confidential. I didn't say to write your name down, did I? Fill it out, leave it anonymous. Or don't write any disease down at all and it won't be covered. Fair? Good. - I'll be in my office. - Workspace. You know what? Come with me. We are going on a little mission. Operation Surprise. - Where are you going? - Um Headed out. Part of my busy day, you know. Meetings. Couldn't find the knob. So, basically, I want to do something nice for my employees. Atlantic City, OK? They have this thing where they send a bus, right, for free, picks everybody up, you head down there, get to the hotel, the room is comped, they give you a pile of chips, and your food, everything just kind of all-inclusive, free kind of weekend. I don't know of anything like that, but you might want to call those casinos directly. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I did. So. Wait. What are you writing? Don't write Ebola or mad cow disease. Right? Cos I'm suffering from both. - I'm inventing new diseases. - Oh, great. Let's say my teeth turn to liquid and they drip down the back of my throat. - What would you call that? - I thought you were inventing diseases. That's spontaneous dental hydroplosion. - Nice. - Thank you. Calling you ask you a little favoroonie. Trying to give the troops around here a little bit of a boost. I was thinking that maybe we could take them down to take a spin on your big ride. You mean the elevator that takes you down into the mine shaft? It's not really a ride. It says here that it's a 300ft drop. It goes 300 feet into the earth but it moves really slowly. - So it's not a free fall. - It's an industrial coal elevator. Uh All right. Well, once you get down into the mine, what Have you got Laser Tag or something? OK, so I don't know what the surprise is. Am I worried? No. No way. See, I thrive on this. This is my world. This is improv. This is Whose Line Is It Anyway? Who did this? I'm not mad. I just want to know who did it so I can punish them. - What are you talking about? - Someone forged medical information. - That is a felony. - Whoa. That's a pretty intense accusation. - How do you know that they're fake? - Uh, leprosy? "Flesh-eating bacteria. "Hot-dog fingers. "Government-created killer nanorobot infection. " - You did this, didn't you? - No. I know it was you. Fine. I'll have to interview each and every one of you until the perpetrator makes him or herself known. And until that time, there will be no health care coverage for anyone. - Killer nanorobots? - It's an epidemic. The problem, Jim, is that people who are really suffering from a medical condition won't receive the care they need, because someone in this office is coming up with all this ridiculous stuff. - "Count Choculitis. " - Sounds tough. Why did you write that down, Jim? Is it because you know I love Count Chocula? - Do you? - I think you need to confess the fact - Yeah. - What are you doing? Those are my keys. - Good luck. - Jim! Damn it! No! Jim! Let me out! Jim! Let The light green - Jim Halpert. - Let me out. - Who is this? - You're fired. - You can't fire me. - I can. I'm manager for the day. - Clean out your desk. - Can you hold on? I'm getting the, er beep. - Jim Halpert. - Hey, Jim. It's Pam. Hey, Pam. How are you? - Good. How are you? - I'm doing OK. Getting excited for the weekend. What are you up to? - I'm not bothering you, am I? - Not at all. - You're not doing anything? - I have nothing to do. Jim! This weekend? Nothing. I'm not really doing anything. I might go to the mall. I need new shoes. Oh, interesting. What kind of shoes? - Hello? - Hello. This is Dwight Schrute calling for Jan Levenson-Gould. - This is Jan. - Hi. Dwight Schrute, Acting Manager, Scranton branch. I needed your permission to fire Jim Halpert. - Who is this? - Dwight Schrute. From sales? Where's Michael Scott? He is not here right now. He put me in charge of the office. Dwight, listen carefully. You are not a manager of anything. - Understand? - That's not entirely true. He put me in charge of picking the health care plan. Really? OK. When Michael gets back, tell him to call me immediately. Call you immediately. Good. Oh, listen. Since I have you on the phone, can I fire Jim? No. Please don't use my cellphone ever again. Oh, I thought this was your Hey, everybody. Ice-cream sandwiches! Aaahh! Here you go. Take one, take one. It's all good. Phyllis, think fast. Ya-bome! Oh, I see Angela. Angela? Waaaahhh! Hey, temp. Why don't you take two? Because you don't get health care. And faster metabolism. Did you get the kind with the cookies? Why don't you just eat it, OK? - And here you go, Stanley the manly. - Oh, thanks. This isn't the big surprise, is it? Because we've been having a pretty horrible day. Er Nope. Nope. This isn't the surprise. It's surprising, um because you didn't expect it. But you will You'll know it when you see it. Michael. Michael? Oh, Christ. I tried being rational, OK, and what happened? The employees went crazy. I got no help from Corporate. That leaves me with no options. I'm going to read your submitted conditions. When you hear yours, raise your hand to indicate that it is real. If you do not raise your hand, it will not be covered. - What about confidentiality? - You have forfeited that privilege. I have tried to treat you all as adults but obviously I am the only adult here. Number one. Inverted penis. Could you mean vagina? Because if you do, I want that covered. Your vagina was removed during your hysterectomy. A uterus is different from a vagina. I still have a vagina. OK. Great. Dermatitis. Thank you, Angela. I'll make sure that's covered. OK. Now. Who wrote this hysterical one? - Anal fissures? - That's a real thing. Yeah, but no one here has it. Someone has it. - Do you think we should go? - I don't know. This is important. - What is he doing? - I don't know. Well? Well, what? You could be referring to anything. OK. The health care plan. Why did you put Dwight in charge? He was horrible. Dwight? Did you raise benefits? - I most certainly did not. - Oh, come on. That's horrible. Aah Thanks, Dwight, for a crappy plan. Ah, damn! Oh I wish I had time to change it but Jan needs it by five. What time is it? It's after five. Oh Oh, it's awful! So. Well. OK. See you guys on Monday. What about the surprise? Oh Yes. Exactly. Thank you, Angela, for reminding me. Terrific. Before I tell everybody what the big surprise is, would you like to tell me what you think the big surprise is? - We all think you don't have a surprise. - I have some news for you. There is a big surprise. And here it is. Here we go. And the big surprise is Brrrrrrrr! Drum roll Brrrrrrrr! Brrrrrrrr! When I am backed into a corner, that is when I come alive. See, I learned improv from the greats, like Drew Carey and Ryan Stiles. God, yeah Ah! This Robin Williams. Man, would I love to go head-to-head with him. Oh! That would be exciting. "Hi. I'm Mork from Ork. " Well, I'm Bork from Spork. Nanoo, nanoo. Jibelee, baloobaloo. Oh, um Jan wants you to call her. Hey, have they left for the big meeting yet? I got Michael's lucky tie. No, they're in the conference room. Okay. Wait. Are those Michael's Levi's? Yeah. Who dry-cleans jeans? PAM: Michael and his jeans. He gets in them, and I'm not exactly sure what happens, but I can tell you he loves the way he looks in those jeans. I know that's why he started Casual Fridays. I'll take those. Thanks. This is a projection of the county's needs. Wow. Graphs and charts. So Somebody's really been doing their homework. Looks like USA Today. Thirteen schools, two hospitals JIM: So, this possible client they're talking about, actually a big deal. It's Lackawanna County, our whole county. And if we get this, they might not have to downsize our branch. And I could work here for years. And years. And years. So when we get to the Radisson, I would like to Oh, I changed it to Chili's. Excuse me? Radisson, it just gives out this vibe. It's like, "Oh, I'm doing business at the Radisson." It's kind of snooty. So You had no right to do that, Michael. Here's the thing. "Chili's is the new golf course. "It's where business happens." Small Businessman Magazine. It said that? It will. I sent it in. Letter to the editor. All right. But you will let me run this meeting. (MUMBLING IN AGREEMENT) Power trip. What? She had done a background check on me. She had it printed out. No. Yeah. And she was asking me about stuff, line by line, while we were having dinner. RYAN: That is unbelievable. What's going on? We are doing worst first dates. Oh, my God, I win. Okay, it was a minor league hockey game, he brought his brother, and when I went to the bathroom, the game ended and they forgot about me. Okay, that's a joke. No, they had to come back for me. Wait, when was this? Um It was not that long ago. Wait, not Roy. Say it's not your fiance. I always knew Pam has refused to go to sports games with Roy, but I never knew why. Interesting. Okay, let's do this thing. Wish us luck. Good luck, Michael. Good luck, Jan. Thank you. Kiss ass. Okay, probably going to go late tonight, burning the midnight tequila. So, I think you all could just take off now. Michael, this shouldn't take more than an hour. Well Do you always shut down the entire office when you leave for an hour? No, no. That would not be efficient. Actually, they just don't get very much work done when I'm not here. That's not true, I know how to delegate. And they do more work when I'm not here. Not more. The same amount of work is done, whether I'm here or not. Hey, everybody, listen up! This is what we're gonna do. You sit tight until I return. Sound good? Doesn't matter, it's an order. Follow it blindly. Okay. All right, ciao. Adios! So which way is Chili's? I'll drive. No, that's all right. I wanna leave straight from there. It is just a couple blocks away, so Boy, you really don't know Scranton, do you? I know Scranton. At all! All right Have you ever been to Scranton, Jan? (SINGING) If it's a couple of blocks away, we can go together. Okay. MICHAEL: Jan Levinson-Gould. Jan is cold. If she was sitting across from you on a train and she wasn't moving, you might think she was dead. We should come up with a signal of some sort. Why would we need a signal? Well, in case one of us gets into trouble, the other one can signal What kind of trouble are you planning on getting in, Michael? Well, it could be either of us. You're gonna let me do the talking, we agreed on that. Yes. MICHAEL: Hello? Christian? Yes. I thought that was you. Hi. Hi. Michael Scott. This is Jan Levinson-Gould. Just "Jan Levinson." And No Gould? No. Thank you very much for meeting with us. Have you been waiting long? No, not long. Good. Good. Jan, what happened? Michael. Is Gould dead? What Michael, we got divorced, okay? I'm so sorry, excuse me. Wow, you're kidding me. Do you want to talk about it? Michael. Could we have a table for three, please? When did this happen? We're in a meeting. Okay. WAITRESS: This way, please. Christian. All right, after you. Thank you. I thought we could start by going over the needs of the county. Right. Well, Lackawanna County has not been immune to the slow economic growth over the past five years. So for us, the name of the game is budget reduction and Awesome Blossom? What? I think we should share an Awesome Blossom. What do you say? They are awesome. You want to, Christian? Blossom? Sure. Okay, it's done. Actually, Megan? May we have an Awesome Blossom, please? Extra awesome. Now it is done. So, if you have a Hey, I heard a very, very funny joke the other day. You wanna hear it? Christian, you don't have to listen to this. We can It's okay, I like jokes. Okay. Just the one. Just one joke? Okay. Well, if it's just going to be one, I will think of a different joke. Um Let's see. Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Pam, it's Michael. I need you to go into my office and check some data for me. Okay, you want me to read them? Yes. Okay. "A fisherman is walking down Fifth Avenue, "leading an animal behind him when" No, no. Told it, not as good as you think. Pick another one. Okay. "There's a transcript between a naval ship" Okay! Bingo! And a lighthouse. Yes. That is hysterical. Could you start that one from the beginning? Sure. "There's a transcript between a naval ship and a lighthouse" (CLOSING DRAWER) Is this real? It is a screenplay starring himself. Agent Michael Scarn. Of the FBI. How long is this? Oh, Pam! Good work! Oh, wait, stop. Drawings. PAM: What is that? Oh, those are drawings. In case the writing didn't really put a picture in your head. And there he is, in the flesh, Agent Michael Scarn. Now we know what he looks like. The first guy says, "Well, I'm an astronaut, so I drive a Saturn." And the second guy says, "Well, I am a pimp, so I drive a cheap Escort." And the third guy says, "I got you both beat. "I'm a proctologist, so I drive a brown Probe." Oh, no! No! Oh, my God, that's funny! I almost had Awesome Blossom coming out of my nose! Excuse me, could I have a vodka tonic, please? JIM: Do we all have our copy of Threat Level Midnight by Michael Scott? Yeah. Oh, yeah. All right, let's get this started. I'm gonna be reading the action descriptions and, Phyllis, I would like you to play Catherine Zeta-Jones. That's the character's name? Oh, yeah. You guys should not be doing this. Why not, Dwight? This is a movie. I mean, this is for all of America to enjoy. You took something that doesn't belong to you Dwight. brought it in here and made copies of it. Do you want to play the lead role of Agent Michael Scarn? (MICHAEL MIMICKING HUNGRY MONSTER) Hey, that's delicious. I love it. We would probably be upset with ourselves if we went this whole night without talking business, so Dunder Mifflin can provide a level of personal service to the county that the warehouse chains just can't match. Well, we are out to save money. What's the bottom line? (GIBBERING NONSENSICALLY) That's why I wanted a signal between us, so I wouldn't have to just shout nonsense words. That's her fault. Did somebody say, "baby back ribs"? Hmm? Hmm? I don't think Christian has time for that I have time. (MICHAEL TAPPING SPOON RHYTHMICALLY) (SINGING) I want my baby back, baby back, baby back I want my baby back, baby back, baby back I want my baby-back, baby-back, baby-back Chili's baby-back ribs I want my baby-back, baby-back "Inside the FBI, Agent Michael Scarn sits with his feet up on his desk. "Catherine Zeta-Jones enters." "Sir, you have some messages." "Not now!" "They're important." "Okay, what are they?" "The first message is, 'I love you.' That's from me." "Not in a thousand years, Catherine, we work together. "And get off my desk." Yes, I have acted before. I was in a production of Oklahoma! In the seventh grade. I played the part of Mutie the Mailman. They had too many kids, so they made up roles like that. I was good. "If it isn't my old partner, Samuel L. Chang." "Agent Michael Scarn, you lost some weight." DWIGHT: "Thank you for noticing. "Now, keep me company for one more mission." (WHISPERING) Hey, I have to work late. RYAN: "But as soon as I blow out these candles" You're joking, right? JIM: Michael Scarn takes out a 9mm gun and shoots the cake. (IMITATING GUN FIRING) (RYAN LAUGHING) "Agent Michael Scarn, you so funny. Word." Michael's movie? Two thumbs down. "A man, sitting several seats down, who has a gold face, "turns to Michael Scarn." (EXCLAIMS) Oscar? Do you want to play "Golden Face"? (CLEARING THROAT) "Mr. Scarn, perhaps you would be more comfortable in my private jet." "Yes, perhaps I would, Golden Face. Sam, get my luggage." "I forget it, brother." "Samuel, you are such an idiot. "You are the worst assistant ever and you're disgusting." "Dwigt." Wait, who's Dwigt? PAM: Here's what we think happened. Michael's sidekick, who all through the movie, is this complete idiot who's causing the downfall of the United States, was originally named Dwight, but then Michael changed it to Samuel L. Chang using a search and replace. But that doesn't work on misspelled words, leaving behind one "Dwigt." And Dwight figured it out. Oops! D-W-l-G-H-T. Okay, you know what? I am done with this. That's it. The end. JIM: Well, some of us wanna keep reading, if you don't You don't speak for everyone, Jim. Okay, announcement. My uncle bought me some fireworks. And anyone who wants to see a real show, come with me outside now. JIM: That's actually a good idea. We'll all take a brief intermission. Hey, are you hungry? Yeah. Yeah? And so, after watching my mom go through so much pain, I decided to keep that promise that I made to her, and take care of her. (EXCLAIMING) Well, this brings us to Jan. Truth or dare. Tell us about your divorce. Oh, no! Michael. Michael. Do. Michael. Michael, please. No. Do, right? Really. It's Hey, you say you're not gonna play. She's not playing. She's not playing the game. It isn't fair. We'd been fighting for a while. Check, please. He didn't want kids. I knew that going into it, but he also knew that I did. So I guess I thought that he would change his mind, he thought that I would change mine. You didn't? I was stupid. No, no, you were not stupid. Gould was stupid, right? That's right. You know? You were really brave. I mean, you put your arms out there, you slit your wrists. That's true. You said, "World, this is my blood, it's red, just like yours. "So love me." JIM: I had plans to meet a friend tonight, which I had to cancel. But this is cool, too. I'm not a complainer. Wow. For the bugs. Nice. And that's excellent because bugs love my famous grilled cheese sandwich. Yes. Nice. I can't remember the last time someone made me dinner. (WHOOPING) Yeah! Yes! Right down the street? Kenneth Road, born and raised. Spent my whole life right here in Lackawanna County and I do not intend on moving. I know this place. I know how many hospitals we have. I know how many schools we have. It's home, you know? I know the challenges that this county is up against. Here's the thing about those discount suppliers, they don't care. They come in, they undercut everything, and they run us out of business. And then, once we're all gone, they jack up the prices. I know. It's bad. It's terrible. It is. You know what? It really is. (SHUSHING) I don't know. I guess I could give you guys our business, but you have to meet me halfway, okay, because they're expecting me to make cuts. Well, corporate's gonna go ballistic, but you think we could, Jan? So I guess I'll see you in What are you gonna do with your time off? Travel. Yeah. I've been looking forward to it. It's gonna be really nice. I'm gonna find myself. You have new music? Yeah. Definitely. (MELODIC INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING) See you! Bye! Thanks. Yes! We did it. We got it! I mean, we got it! We nailed it! Nailed it! Come here. Yes! I am really thrilled. Let's go. What? Let's go. Going Okay. Where're we going? Doesn't matter. Going to the go-go. (LAUGHING) Okay. Michael? Michael? Michael? His car's not in the parking lot. I should check the accident reports. Who's this? Jan. (BEEPING) Good morning, Pam. Hey. No, nothing happened. I swear. Nothing happened. What? I'm totally being serious. A gentleman does not kiss and tell. And neither do I. No, seriously, guys, I'm not (STUTTERING) I don't want to go into it at all. It's off-limits. Fine. I took her back to her hotel and we made out for a little while. It was great. I mean, she told me about her divorce, we talked for about five hours, she fell asleep on my arm, so Hello, Dwight. Did you do her? Who? Jan Levinson-Gould. No, no. No Gould. Did you do her? This is none of your affair. Because she is your boss And she is your boss. And she is a woman. She is a strong, soft, thoughtful, sexy woman. And you know what? I don't think I can sit here and let you talk about her that way without me defending her honor. Jan, I defend your honor. Is that all? (WHISPERING) Jan didn't come back for her car last night. (WHISPERING) What? Could it be that Agent Michael Scarn has finally found his Catherine Zeta? Oh, I don't know. (PHONE RINGING) Oh, my God. This is Jan's cell. No way. Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. I know we have to register as a consensual sexual relationship with HR. My question, do I do it as the man? Does she do it as my superior? I don't know. That leads to other issues that we may have in our relationship. (PHONE RINGING) It's Excuse me. Hello? Hi. Just talking about you. To the camera? No. Uh-huh. How's traffic? I miss you. What? Okay. Well, if it was a mistake, it was a wonderful mistake. No. Could you just No, I did not intentionally get you drunk. Mmm-hmm. No, no. This is just a fight. This is just the first of many fights we're going to have. Right. No! See, you I don't understand. You want to see other people? Only other people? Why? Okay, I think you're still a little bit drunk. Excuse me. Excuse me? I think you're Yes, why don't you just come back here? We can go to the hotel, have a few drinks. No, I didn't slip you something. Some might even say we had our first date last night. Oh, really? Really. Why might some say that? 'Cause there was dinner by candlelight. Mmm-hmm. Dinner and a show, if you include Michael's movie. And there was dancing and fireworks. Pretty good date. We didn't dance. You're right. We didn't dance. It was more like swaying. But it's still romantic. Swaying isn't dancing. At least I didn't leave you at a high school hockey game. I have some faxes to get out. Oh, come on, Pam. I JIM: Okay, we didn't dance. And I was totally joking, anyway. I mean It's not really a date if the girl goes home to her fiance. Right?   What? Oh, nothing. Pam's on vacation and she gets back tomorrow, so it'll be nice to see her. It'll be nice. And she set a date for the wedding with Roy. June. Summer. So, that'll be nice. And that's that. (PHONE RINGING) What? Oh, nothing. Jim's been looking at me, kind of, a lot all week. I would be creeped out by it, but it's nothing compared to the way Michael looks at me. MICHAEL: Spamster! Pam, plus Spam, plus Hamster. Right. Welcome back. How was your vacation? It was great. Yeah? Did you get lucky? (MICHAEL EXCLAIMING) Boink. Roy and I just got back from the Poconos. I get 10 vacation days a year and I try to hold off taking them for as long as possible. And this year I got to the third week in January. "I am Pam." Spicoli guy. Oh, God. Names, numbers. Okay. Whoa! God! Yuck! Yuck! Yuck! PAM: What? Yuck! Wow, what happened in there? I don't know. There is stink in there. My God. What is that? Oh, I don't know. Is that a bird? No, I don't think it's a bird. Oh, God. How could that happen? How could Right in the middle of the carpet. What's going on? Somebody vomited right in the middle of the carpet in my office. I don't think that's vomit. Check it out. KEVIN: Me? MICHAEL: Check it out. Don't be a wuss. Just get No, I'm not holding your coffee. Tell me what it is. Oh, that's ridiculous. What is it? Michael. What is it? No, just tell me what it is! Michael, I gotta get out of here. I can't hold my breath that long. PAM: Open the door up. It smelled terrible. KEVIN: Oh! MICHAEL: Jeez Oh, no I cannot believe a pipe burst and left that there. That's no burst pipe. How do you know that? What is it then? Hey, guys. Somebody making soup? Here she comes. All clean? Great. (COUGHING) It's still stinky. That is worse. She probably scrubbed it into the fibers of the carpet. Total permeation. I am a big Fear Factor fan. I'm a big fan of anything Joe Rogan does, actually. So this is sort of like my audition tape. (CLEARING THROAT) I can't stand it. I can't stay in here another second. No! Hey. Welcome back. Thanks! So, how was the resort? Did you ski a lot? A little. Good. (DOOR OPENING) What's going on in here? What? I did not do that. That sounds disgusting. It wasn't me. It wasn't me. It was not me. Oh. Wow. (PAM LAUGHING) Hey, Jim. I thought that we would be desk buddies while they changed my carpet. That might be a little difficult with the one computer. Oh, it's There's definitely a desk open in the back. Yeah. Which I guess I'll be taking. No, no, no. Seriously, I don't mind sharing. No, no, no. Seriously, I'll be in the back. Hey, Kelly. Are you moving back here? Just for the day, while Michael's at my desk. Because Toby used to sit there, but then he had to move over there because of an allergy. Allergy to the desk? Weird. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Old bullpen. The old bullpen. Don't ape me. Okay. This is great. Yeah. The pressures of my office are insane. I just You couldn't understand, but man, you guys have it easy out here. You know, I used to sit right here? No way. Yeah. And who had your office? Ed Truck. (EXCLAIMING IN DISGUST) Ed Truck was the manager before me. Horrible. He hated fun. It was like, "Oh, Ed Truck is walking toward us, so stop having fun. "Start pretending to do work." What a jerk. He's You know what? I swore to myself that if I ever got to walk around the room as manager, people would laugh when they saw me coming and would applaud as I walked away. I'm serious. My closet doors will not shut. I mean, it only takes so long to measure to make sure that clothes will hang up. 'Cause aren't all hangers, like, that big? So I don't understand why the closet engineer didn't think of that. So now I'm doing this new thing where I just leave piles of clothes on the floor and I walk around the piles to get an outfit You know who used to sit at that desk? That guy Miles, who quit to form his own company? Todd Packer. No. Yeah. I thought he was out on the road. He was, but that desk was empty. He'd come in and sit there sometimes. When I was in training, many years ago, not so long ago, I worked side-by-side with a fellow named Todd Packer. And together we rocked the office. (HAMMERING LOUDLY) MICHAEL: Packer and I once spent a whole day with our pants off. And when people noticed, we convinced them that they were crazy. I will gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today. Excuse me one second, please? What is it that you need right now that can't wait until I'm off the phone with a customer? A customer. Well, sound the alarm. (CHUCKLING) Okay. Another time, Packer held this guy's head in the toilet for like, a minute. The guy had no sense of humor about it. Probably why he wasn't hired. (GROANING) What did you hit me for? Charley horse! What? Charley horse! You shouldn't have hit me, Michael. Okay. Once, as a joke, Packer banged every chick in the office. It was hysterical. Beyonce, pink the color, Pink the person, hot dogs, basically anything that is awesome. Snow cones Hey, Jim, Michael wanted me to ask you how to raise your desk chair. It's the lever on the side. That's what I told him. Thanks. Oh, my God, he is so cute. Would you talk to him for me and see if he likes me? No, I don't think I can Oh, please, Jim. Please, please, Jim. Please, please, please, he's so cute. I like him so much. And I would do it, but I'm too shy. Please, Jim. Please, please, please. Please, Jim. Please, please, please. (WHISPERING) Dwight? Michael. Let's send up Accounting. What? Old-fashioned raid. Sales on Accounting. Yeah, follow my lead. Hey, guys. Hey, Michael. What's up? Hey, Dwight. (SCREAMING WILDLY) (LAUGHING) MICHAEL: Come on, come on, come on, come on! MICHAEL: Sales rules! DWIGHT: Yes! Yeah! Yeah! DWIGHT: Should we help them pick up their stuff? MICHAEL: No, no, no, no. We don't do that. We don't do that. Okay. Watch out, Pam. You're next. You're gonna throw my things on the ground? Maybe. OSCAR: What happened in Michael's office was wrong. I understand it. It makes sense. But it was still wrong. Why would somebody ruin a perfectly good carpet? I don't know. It could be done out of hate. It could be done out of love. It could be completely neutral. Maybe somebody hates the cleaning lady. And, well, she doesn't do a very good job, obviously, because my office still reeks like you would not believe. I hate her. You know what? I am beginning to think that what happened to my carpet was an act of terrorism against the office. The only thing that makes any sense. Hello, am I the 107th caller? Hello, Rock 107, am I the 107th caller? Hello, Rock 107, am I the 107th caller? I'm totally gonna win us that box set. Stop. Jethro Tull Stop it. Stop it. Don't. Don't. I need to make a sales call. Please? All right. Am I the 107th caller? PAM: Back so soon. ROY: We can go back. ROY: We can go back in, like, a couple of weeks maybe. Yeah, right. Okay, maybe another month, like, maybe for, like, Presidents' Day or something? Yeah, that's right. We could do a three-day weekend. I wonder if I could, like, call in sick on the Friday. Then I get a four-day weekend. (KELLY TALKING INAUDIBLY) KELLY: And when I wake up, I feel fine. But it's so weird to fall asleep. And I just hate it KELLY: 'cause I try to go to bed at, like, 9:30. PAM: Are you kidding? ROY: No. Hi, guys. We haven't finished getting things in order from your last visit. I'm just walking around. Were you? Well, yeah. It's just that we're really swamped over here, Michael. Oh, and I'm not? Why would you say that? Because I'm having fun? You guys just are working for the weekend, aren't you? I am working for the week. Sales team. Listen to me. This is what we're gonna do. I'm gonna up the ante a little bit, literally. Right here I'm gonna put a crisp $100 bill. The person with the most sales at the end of the day gets to keep the cash. Sound good? Yeah! Seventy, eighty, one, two, three. $83. Still a lot of money and I'm going to I'm gonna leave it right over here where everybody can see it. I will be taking Jim's clients today because he is not here, and out of sight. Out of the contest. Let's see who winds up with the cash, shall we? You're gonna compete against us? Oh, it is on, Phyllis. It is so on! It is so on! God, this is gonna be fun. Michael is gonna wipe the floor with us. So, you have and I will deliver those personally in a Sebring. Very good. Nice doing business with you. Thank you. Yes! Oh! Yeah. Read it and weep. Oh! Oh, look at that! Look at me, Phyllis! Oh, what is that? That's my sale! (HUMMING VICTORIOUSLY) What's that? What are you doing? Nothing. I think he's dancing. No, just That was definitely not dancing. You know what, guys? It's none of your concern. It was official business, so just DARRYL: Paper business. Yeah, paper business. Is this done? Nope. Extreme Home Makeover puts together a house in an hour. If you were on that crew, you'd be fired like that. Somebody did something bad to Michael's carpet. Maybe that's all we need to know. Who do you think did it? Are you kidding? I thought it was you. Really? I thought you. MICHAEL: This was no act of God. A person did this. A person who works in this office. Maybe all of them. You know what? Today is not a good day for a sales contest. We're not doing this today. That doesn't seem fair. You want to talk about fair? Does anyone need to smell my old carpet? You explain to me how that was fair and I'll explain to you how this is fair. Plus, I just I think that picking today was sort of taking advantage. But you're the one who picked today. I am a victim of a hate crime. Stanley knows what I'm talking about. That's not what a hate crime is. Well, I hated it a lot, okay. I You know what? If the guilty person would just come forward and take their punishment, we'd be done. Very well, then you're all punished. What's our punishment? You're all on a time out. Just sit there quietly. (PHONE RINGING) MICHAEL: No, no. Hey. What's up? Nothing much. Let me ask you something. It's actually a little awkward. What? What do you think of Kelly? I don't know. It depends if you like a little junk in She's really cool. Are you interested in her? Yeah, totally. Really? Did she say something? She said lots of things. Do you know if she's looking for a long-term thing or if she'd be cool just hanging out? I have no idea. Can you find out? Yeah. Sure. Oh, long-term, definitely. Fall in love, have babies, spend every second together. But don't tell him that, okay? Just tell him I'm, like, up for anything. I mean, I'm not a slut, but who knows? Do you remember Ed Truck? Sure. He hired me. How's he doing? How would I know? I thought you might. My biggest fear is turning into him. Michael, you should have much bigger fears than that. I wasn't talking literally, Creed. Yeah, being buried alive would be worse. Happy? Why am I talking to you? Ed? Hi, thanks for meeting me. It must be kind of neat coming back. Yeah. Shall we go upstairs? Well, honestly, Ed, I really don't want to be up there right now. So, what's the problem with my pension? Oh, no, no, no, you're good. It was clerical. You're good. Well, somebody did something in my office and I now think that they did it on purpose and it was directed at me. Well, what was done? I didn't get a good look at it, but it smells horrible. Yeah, somebody once did that in my office. Really? Yeah. Well, that figures. So, how did you deal with people not liking you? You can't expect to be friends with everybody. Well, sure I can. No. They'll always think of you as a boss first. Not necessarily. You can love a boss like you do a father. I'm not sure that ever happens. Well, okay. Different management styles. Why can't your workers be your workers, family be your family, your friends be your friends? MICHAEL: Last week I would have given a kidney to anyone in this office. I would've reached right into my stomach and pulled it out for them. But now, no. I don't have the relationship with these people that I thought I did. I hope they ask, so they can hear me say, "No. I only give my organs to my real friends. "Go get yourself a monkey kidney." Hey, Brenda, this is Jim Halpert, from the boat? And I got your number from the corporate directory, and well, I was assuming that you probably gave it to them because you wanted me to ask you out, right? So, give me a call back. You can get my number from said directory. Or just check your e-mail, 'cause I just sent you one. Yikes. Give me a call back. I hope. I'll talk to you later. Bye. You just asked a girl out on the phone. Yep. (PHONE RINGING) Yes. Hello, yes, I'm looking for a gay nerd named Michael Scott. Who is this? How did you get this number? Your mom, you gay nerd. Oh, my God. Packer. Packster. Whacky Pack, how you doing? Hey, listen, did you get that package I left for you? No. Did anybody see a package here today? No. How big was it? It was pretty big. Really? Yeah! Did you see a big package? Where did you leave it? Look in the middle of your office. Really? Guys, did you see a big package in my office? You mean, the thing? (PACKER GUFFAWING) Are you kidding me? Special delivery. That was Packer! You are dead! You are dead, my friend. That is Oh, God! Of course it was you. Sit on the throne, Michael. Yeah! Yeah! Oh, my God! It was Packer! It takes an advanced sense of humor. I don't expect everybody to understand. It was done out of love, just like I thought. It's God, these people are so These are good people. We have fun. We just have fun. Oh, I'm just so sorry that I threw the thing out. (LAUGHING) FEMALE VOICE: You have seven unheard messages. (BEEPING) Hey, Jim, it's Pam. I keep looking up to say something to you and then Michael's there and it's horrible. Anyway, I'm bored. Come back. Hey, guess what? I moved my computer so I can't see Michael's head. It's working. I think I can have a career as a very specific type of decorator. Sudoku. Level, moderate. Time, 18 minutes. Suck on that, Halpert. I'll transfer you. Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Hold, please. Dunder Mifflin, this is Okay, sorry. Michael was standing at my desk, and I needed to be busy or who knows what would have happened. So, thank you. Hey, what's that word we made up for when you have a thing stuck in your shoe? Anyway, I have a thing stuck in my shoe. Hey, I have a chance to sneak out of here early and I'm not messing this up. So, I'll see you tomorrow. Calling from my cell phone. I don't know if you guys figured out who did that to Michael's carpet yet, but I have a theory that involves an inter-departmental conspiracy. Everybody in the office. We need to talk. Let's think this through. If we ask corporate for that, then They are either gonna say yes or no. MICHAEL: Could go either way. We don't know what they are going to say. Think it through! We have to think it through! Because, if they say no Can we not? No Yes, we have to. You know why? 'Cause I don't like to be cooped up in that office. In that box, all day long. Heisman! Because I need to think, okay, Jim? Oh, Kevin! Ooh! (MICHAEL LAUGHING) Nice catch. (EXCLAIMING) Oscar! Intercepted. Right here. Give it to me. Sorry about that. Phyllis, give me the ball. Okay, give me the ball. Give me MICHAEL: You guys Oh, cool. Creed, give me the ball, right now. Give it to me. Ryan. (SHOUTING) DWIGHT: Fumble! (GRUNTING) MICHAEL: Listen All right, hey, Dwight Whoa! DWIGHT: Hike. MICHAEL: You all right, Ryan? Ryan? Yeah. Pam! Oh, they're having a sale on TiVo. Maybe I should get a TiVo. DVD burner. Maybe I should get one of those. You are so lucky, Jim. You're so lucky you don't have this problem. What was the ninth-place prize again? A loaf of bread? A Cugino's Pizza. Oh, great. Tasty, terrific pizza. Question: Do their pizzas play DVDs? JIM: Dwight was the top salesman of the year at our company. He wins a little prize money and gets honored at some convention. It is literally the highest possible honor that a Northeastern Pennsylvania-based mid-sized paper company regional salesman can attain. So What did I do to deserve this? PAM: Are you sad that Dwight beat you? No. Are you gonna cry, Jim? Do you need a tissue? Hey. I heard you got a wedding dress. Do you have pictures? PAM: Oh, I Yeah. I'll show them to you later. Oh, I should get back. Talk to you guys later. Okay, cool. I have a ton of stuff to do for the wedding. And I have to do it in the office. And that can be kind of awkward. Just because people can get all weird about wedding stuff and I just I don't want to offend Angela or someone. That's what she said. I don't get it. Grapes, seductive. So, you ready for the big speech this afternoon? Well, it's not really a big speech. You're still coming, right? Oh, abso-fruitly. Fruit, grapes. Nailed the joke. Matter of time. And yes, it is a big speech. Biggest of your life. Speaker at the sales convention. Been there, done that. Went there again, did it again. Two years in a row. Consecutive. I just I miss the feeling of knowing that you did a good job because somebody gives you proof of it. "Sir, you're awesome. Here's a plaque. "What, a whole year has gone by and you need more proof? "Here's a certificate." They stopped making plaques that year. What if I give a really long, extended thank you, for instance, "Thank you, Mr. Blank. Thank you very, very, very" That would look terrible. These are mostly salesmen, and salesmen expect to be entertained and you are the main act. When I was in the sixth grade, I was a finalist in our school spelling bee. It was me against Raj Patel. And I misspelled in front of the entire school the word "failure." I can't do this. That's because you're incapable of doing it, because you don't know how, because you have no skills. Dwight, there's no way I can possibly teach you what you need to know about public speaking by speech time. Oh, okay. But I can teach you enough so that you don't embarrass me or the company. Okay, deal. I'll do whatever you say, no questions asked. Well, if you have a question, you should ask me. I'll try and think of one. When Don't try to think of a question to humor me. Just try not to be such an idiot. Is that an insult, or is that part of the public speaking advice? Insult. PAM: Mom, I'm sorry, I know you and Dad are chipping in for the wedding but I do not want orange invitations. Yes. Well, if you really want my opinion JIM: Hi, yeah, can I talk to one of your travel agents? I'm gonna take a trip. I'm gonna get out of town for a while, and go someplace not here. Where do I want to go? That is an excellent question. And one I probably should have thought about before I called you. OSCAR: I get here early every morning so I can set the thermostat. I like it a little cooler, around 66 degrees. I'm more productive. Maybe some people don't like it as cold as I do. But I don't care. But seriously, what's the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman? A saleswoman has a vagina. It's a joke, Dwight, it's not a sex ed class. But I'm right. Yeah, you're right about the difference between a man and a woman, but not about the punch line to the joke. All right? The difference between a salesman and a saleswoman is boobs. Hey, do you remember the speeches that you gave? I do, both of them. Could I have a copy of one of them? No, no, they would remember. Look, it doesn't matter what you say, it just matters that you're saying something that people care about. You know? All right, here we go. Watch this. Attention, everybody! Attention, please! I have some very great news from corporate. We had a wonderful quarter. And as a result, all of you are getting bonuses for $1,000. Yeah! MICHAEL: Congratulations. PHYLLIS: Unbelievable. OSCAR: It's great. PAM: Wow. You see that? You see how they responded to me? That's amazing. In that moment, I had them. That is so great about the bonus. No, no, it's not true. I was just talking. So just go out there and say anything. They'll eat it up, they're a great audience. Go ahead, get the wallpaper. Wallpaper the ceiling if you want Excuse me! May I have your attention, please? There has been an accident on 84 West. Cars have skidded off the road into the safety railing. Several cars have flipped, there is broken glass everywhere, several people are injured. Do we know anyone who was in the accident? Brad Pitt. Also, there will be no bonuses. Why would this affect our bonuses? They're unrelated. Is Brad okay? He will never act again. Also, this branch is closing. What the hell's going on here? Are we out of jobs? Yes. KELLY: This is karma because of what he did to Jennifer Aniston. He was kidding! Dwight was kidding and I don't know why because it wasn't funny and it was just horrible STANLEY: Michael? Yeah? You said we were getting bonuses. All right, everybody in the conference room now. Let's go. Let's do it! STANLEY: Cancel the wallpaper. As your leader and your friend, I sort of demand that you can all speak in public as I can, and did, twice. You saw the plaque, right? All right, we're all gonna go around the room, and we're going to make toasts. And that way, we will overcome our fear of public speaking. You mean toastmasters? MICHAEL: Pam! I'm public speaking, stop public interrupting me! Actually, this would be good practice for your wedding toast. Yeah, the bride doesn't really do Have you ever been to a wedding? JIM: Can I go? Yes, good. Jim taking the initiative. So, I am going on a trip. But I'm not really sure where I'm going yet. It's kind of open-ended. So, I was hoping maybe you guys would have some suggestions. You should go to Hedonism. What is that? It's like Club Med, but everything is naked. I was thinking more like Europe or something like that, but good second choice. TOBY: I've been to Amsterdam. Oh, okay, you know what? That's not a toast, you're not standing up. To Amsterdam. When did you go there? After my divorce. JIM: Really? Yeah. JIM: For, like, how long? About a week, or maybe a month. I can't Jimmy, listen to me, you do not wanna go to Amsterdam, trust me. Where do I wanna go? I'd send you to Hong Kong. I'd like to say hi to my friends in China. (SPEAKING IN MANDARIN) Okay. Dwight, show us what you have learned today. Good morning, Vietnam! ALL: Oh, God. Okay, you know what, this isn't working, because I'm not nervous in front of them. They're my subordinates. No, we're not. Yes, you are. I'm assistant regional manager. Which means absolutely nothing. Michael, can you explain? Well, it's mostly made up. So MICHAEL: Dwight is not going to do a good job. It's sad. And they're expecting excellence, because I did do such a good job. Two years in a row, I killed. It was amazing. Confidence, Dwight! Dwight. If you could travel anywhere in the world, where would you go? I can travel anywhere except Cuba, and I will travel to New Zealand and walk The Lord of the Rings trail to Mordor, and then I will hike Mount Doom. So now, just leave me alone. Okay. I was just trying to get some advice on my trip. Oh, please. You're not taking any trip. You know, I majored in Public Speaking in college. You did? Mmm-hmm. And the first thing that they teach you is that you've gotta be true to yourself. And you are all about authority. Yes. I am. The great speakers throughout history were not joke tellers, they were people of passion. So, if you wanna do well today, you gotta do what they did. Which is? You've gotta wave your arms, and you've gotta pound your fists many times. You're supposed to emphasize your point. Okay, I didn't actually major in Public Speaking. But I did download speeches from some of history's famous dictators. Like this one, originally given by Benito Mussolini. Okay, look, I know you're giving this speech on your own, but I wrote up a few talking points for you to take a look at. I hope you don't mind. I'll glance at it. It's time, Dwight, the Grim Reaper is here. The very best of luck to you, Dwight. Thank you, Angela. Why'd you pick the V.A. For the reception? Roy has a connection. It's nicer than you think. You're inviting Jim? Of course, he's one of my closest friends. DWIGHT: All right. You ready? Here we go. Wow. It's a little bit bigger than I remember. MICHAEL: Come on. We're down here in the front. You all ready for this? (DANCE MUSIC PLAYING) I am just feeling under the weather, and I think that I will go home and rest. I've never, ever seen you take a sick day. Well, I've seen you take enough for the both of us. Next, I'd like to introduce the Dunder Mifflin salesman of the year, Dwight Schrute! (WHISPERING) Dwight, they called your name. Dwight, how we doing? No. I can't. Okay, you know what? I can't. You know what? Okay no, no problem. You are lucky you have me here. I'm going to cover for you. All right! Good morning, Vietnam! I am not Dwight Schrute, not at all. I am Michael Scott, his mentor and boss. And until Dwight comes up, if he ever does, I wanted to say a few words about excellence. What makes a work environment excellent? Well, there are many things, I believe, that do such a thing of that nature. And one would be humor. What is the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman? I always set it at 69. Maybe we'll use a DJ. That's the one thing Roy is in charge of for this wedding, but all he's managed to do is set a date. But he did a great job. June 10th is perfect. I want a June wedding. I've always wanted one. Ryan, do you know when you would want to get married? Actually, I don't see ever getting married. Ryan, you should be more sensitive. It's obvious she likes you and comments like that, they just I know what I said. I'm very sorry, I did not know that you were wearing a hearing aid, and I just thought you were speaking abnormally. And now, the black guy from the Police Academy movies, a robot. (MIMICKING ROBOT) Michael Winslow. Anyone? Car starting. (MIMICKING CAR ENGINE REVVING) All right, Dwight Schrute, everyone. Good luck, that is a tough crowd. (BREATHING HEAVILY) (DWIGHT CLEARING THROAT) Blood alone moves the wheels of history! Have you ever asked yourselves in an hour of meditation, which everyone finds during the day, how long we have been striving for greatness? Not only the years we've been at war, the war of work, but from the moment, as a child, when we realized that the world could be conquered. It has been a lifetime struggle, a never-ending fight! I say to you, and you will understand, that it is a privilege to fight! We are warriors! Salesmen of Northeastern Pennsylvania, I ask you, once more rise and be worthy of this historical hour! Yeah! Yeah! I've got a timeshare in Key West that might be available. Maybe. Thanks. You really think you're gonna go? Yeah, I'm definitely going. Nice. Send me a postcard. RYAN: Jim has worked at the same place for five years. Jim eats the same ham and cheese sandwich every day for lunch. I don't know, if I were a betting man, I'd say he will have a fun weekend in Philadelphia. No revolution is worth anything unless it can defend itself! DWIGHT: Some people will tell you "salesman" is a bad word. They'll conjure up images of used car dealers and door-to-door charlatans. This is our duty to change their perception. I say, salesmen and women of the world, unite! We must never acquiesce, for it is together Together that we prevail! We must never cede control of the motherland! For it is ALL: Together that we prevail! Australia? I have always wanted to go there. I'm going. I'm a little nervous to run into Dwight on his connecting flight to Mordor, but, other than that Yeah, I bought the ticket, non-refundable. That's awesome. Where are you staying? I don't know. I feel like I have plenty of time to figure out the details, but When are you leaving? I'm leaving on June 8th. Yeah. And I'm really sorry about that. I just Yeah, that's too bad. Yeah. Do you want me to take these on my way out? It's okay. I got it. All right. Okay, thanks. There you are. What happened? I got thirsty. How'd it go? It was amazing. I wish you would have been there. You would not believe what happened here. What? Something happened? This woman came in, sat down, ordered a drink. The bartender asked for her ID, which I thought was odd, because I pegged her at, like, 35. Weird. Yeah, really weird. So, she's like, "I don't have my ID, please give me one." And he's, like, "I can't do that. I can't serve you." Con artist. She might have been. So she says, "Fine. I will go to my room, I will get my purse, "I will come back, I'll show you my ID." She hasn't come back yet. She's probably in the room, drinking from the mini bar. MICHAEL: Right? MICHAEL: Dwight gave a great speech. That's the word on the street, anyway. And I entertained Dwight to no end with my bar story. So I captivated the guy who captivated a thousand guys. Can you believe that? A thousand guys. I'm hungry. Movie Monday! The only cure I know for the Monday blues is Varsity Blues. Let's go! Let's go, let's go, let's go! Take a seat down there. Second from the end. All right. Everybody here? Yes! Popcorn, anyone? Yes, please! Thank you. Anyone else? No. Movie Monday started with training videos. But we went through those pretty fast. Then we watched a medical video. Since then, it's been half-hour installments of various movies, with the exception of an episode of Entourage, which Michael made us watch six times. Entourage. Kevin? Would you like to do the scenes from last week? Yes. Why him? Don't whine. Get the windows. Previously on Varsity Blues Okay, Billy Bob got a head injury, but Coach made him play. So then Lance, he gets sacked and he's out for the year. Hello? Not everyone approves of Movie Monday. I won't say who. I don't approve. I don't. Hello? Let's go after that title now. Let's go, let's go! Let's go! Hi, Jan. Hope you brought the Milk Duds. How would a movie increase productivity, Michael? How on Earth would it do that? People work faster after. Magically? No. They have to, to make up for the time they lost watching the movie. No. Do I need to hire a babysitter for you, Michael? Kitchen. Some little 14-year old girl whose job it is, is to limit Michael is going to get us all fired. You sat back and let him play that dumb movie and now Jan is peeved off and we're all going to lose our jobs. That's not going to happen. You know she has it out for him now! That's not his fault! He had to follow his heart. Ever since Michael dumped Jan for Carole, Jan's been bitching out on him. Reject a woman, and she will never let it go. One of the many defects of their kind. Also weak arms. Dwight, you should be running this office. Michael would never let me. It's not up to Michael, it's Jan's call. Talk to her. I could never do that. Fine! Sit back and do nothing and let us all get fired. I know that patience and loyalty are good and virtuous traits, but sometimes I just think you need to grow a pair. At the Stamford branch, they all play this World War II videogame called Call of Duty. And they're all really into it. I'm told that it started as a teambuilding exercise. Unfortunately, I really suck at it. We didn't play many videogames in Scranton. Instead, we'd do stuff like Pam and I would sometimes hum the same high-pitched note and try to get Dwight to make an appointment with an ear doctor. And Pam called it Pretendonitis. Hey, Kelly, my stuff just got here. Oh! Oh, my God! Kelly really likes to online shop. So, I felt like I wanted some new clothes. I mean, I just I wanted to It's just, I felt like it was time to maybe, just get new clothes. Okay. I love it! Really? I don't know. No, you haven't even tried it on yet. Try it on. Not at work. I'll try it on Fashion show. Fashion show at lunch! No Fashion show, fashion show at lunch. Fashion show! Fashion show! Fashion show at lunch! Why did you do that? I'm just killing Germans any way I can. We're on the German team. Shoot the British. Wait, are we playing teams? Yeah. Hello? Is this Jan? Who is this? This is Dwight Schrute. I am calling about an extremely sensitive matter. You should talk to Michael and he'll talk to me, and that way we don't have to speak to each other. It's about Michael. What about him? I can't talk here. It's too sensitive. It's not about a surprise party, is it? No, but we should discuss that another time. Look, I'm already an hour outside of Scranton, Dwight, I'm not coming back. Pull over at Exit 40. There is a Liz Claiborne outlet. I know you like that store. Go inside and shop until I can meet you. How do you know I like that store? Many of your blouses are Claibornes. How do you know that? It's part of my job. No, it's not. It's officially not. Noted. I'm going to the dentist. Okay. I have to have an emergency crown put in. Yes. It's a new dentist. He's far. I might be gone three hours. Three hours? Wow! Have fun. Did you get anything good? Yeah. New blouse? Halter-top? Camisole? Teddy? I could save the branch. Really? If you let me run it. Okay. Okay, I can run it? What would you do differently? Mostly get rid of waste, which is half the people there. And clean house. Right here, it's all for me. Thank you. Dwight, you must feel strongly to speak with me this way, behind Michael's back, and turn on so many of your co-workers. The decision to turn on Michael was difficult. But once I did it, I didn't look back. And mostly I feel that Michael would approve. It's really what's best for the branch. And I could care less about my co-workers. So, here we are. It's all on the table. I want the branch. And I await your decision. Oh, by the way, there's a new Ann Taylor outlet store near here. I know you like their earrings. Where is it? Michael! Hi. I had a very interesting conversation with one of your employees. Oh, that's nice. No, it wasn't. Dwight just told me that he thinks he can run the branch better than you. What? You were at the dentist? You can't have people undermining you. Get control of your branch immediately. Okay. What was Dwight thinking? That he could turn Jan against me? She's my ex-lover-ish. Wow! It's so sexy! You look so hot. It's really something. It's too much. What? I'm gonna return it. No. You have to keep it today, just see how you feel. Hey. Hi. You look nice. Thanks. Isn't that, like, your third soda today? Yeah, I think we can be a big help to your company. Okay, see you next week. Bye. Again? Scared? Call of Duty. Andy, Jim, can I see you in the conference room for a minute? Now? Yes, now. Put the game on hold, everyone. This is not working, okay? We are getting slaughtered out there. It's the new guy. Oh, I'm sorry, I don't know what we're talking about. See what I mean? We just need a strategy, okay? We're gonna set up a trap in the gunroom. All right? Jim, are you using the MP40 or the. 44? Sniper rifle? Snipe What? Jim! In Carentan? Are you playing for the other team? You don't snipe in Carentan, okay? It's saboteur! Saboteur! Andy, it's not I'm gonna kill you for real. This game, the game is over. I'm really going to shoot you. Hey, Dwight. Hey. Do you want an M&amp;M;? No, thanks. I'm stuffed. No, seriously, you should have an M&amp;M;, they're really good. Okay. Good, huh? So good. Hey, I thought you weren't supposed to eat anything for a couple of hours after you've had a crown put in. They have this new kind of quick-drying bonding. So Sounds like a good dentist. Oh, yeah. What's his name? Crentist. Your dentist's name is Crentist? Yeah. Sounds a lot like dentist. Maybe that's why he became a dentist. Let me see your teeth. Let me see them. Let me see them. You should floss them. I know. Well, then. I'm glad you're okay. Business is like a jungle. And I am like a tiger. And Dwight is like a monkey that stabs the tiger in the back with a stick. Does the tiger fire the monkey? Does the tiger transfer the monkey to another branch? Pun. There's no way of knowing what goes on inside the tiger's head. We don't have the technology. Dwight, can I talk to you for a second? Wow. This is tough! What? What is it? Well I just got off the phone with Jan. And She demoted me. No. Yeah. You know what the craziest part of this is? She demoted me to your job. And she said that you should be expecting a call later from corporate, and that I guess that means that you are going to be acting manager of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. I can't believe this news. That Wow! Yeah. I told her I didn't know whether you'd want to do it because you've always been so loyal to me. You've been my most trusted ally. You said that? Yup, I did. I did. But I think you should do it. Well, gosh, if you think I should then I will. Perfect. Well, we're settled. All right. All right. Well, then you are now Acting Manager of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton branch, and I am Assistant Regional Manager. Assistant to the Regional Manager. Thank you, Michael, for staying on, I really appreciate it. Oh Hey, hey. I can't imagine this place without you. Can't you? That's so nice. Well, I guess we should go tell the troops. Yeah, when I'm ready, Mike. Okay, let's do it. Hey, hi, hello, everybody. I have some good news and I have some bad news. I am being replaced as your leader by Dwight. You're kidding. You might think that I am kidding, and I understand that. Congratulations, Dwight. Thank you, Angela. But, why Dwight? Because Dwight never lies. How does that qualify him to run a branch? Because that's all it takes. Okay, Dwight, would you like to say a few words to everybody about loyalty? Thank you, Michael. I just want to say, to the few of you who will remain under my employ, that I intend to lead you into the black with ferocity! Michael? What will you do? Oh, I'll be fine. Do you have any savings? No, no, I don't. But Michael, you might lose your condo. I won't. I won't. I have this little old vacuum cleaner that's broken. If Dwight doesn't work out, maybe that could be manager. Maybe I'll quit. It's really happening. Yes. We can make a difference here. I will make a difference here. You alone? 'Cause I thought together we were Oh, please! Don't be naive. But you can be in charge of the women. Look how cute he is. And he's trying to shoot with a smoke grenade. I'm sorry, what are you whispering about me? No, nothing. Just concentrate on turning around. Yeah, I'm trying, I just Just tap "S" then "D." Oh. Any last words? No? What? Wow! Psychopath. What? I'm just looking. Please go back to your desk. In a minute. Well, I remember why I dress the way I do at work. But I'm gonna keep the clothes. I mean, it'll just be cool to have some after-work clothes that aren't pajamas. Well, I guess it's time that I turn over the keys to the famous Sebring. No, thank you. It's a corporate lease, Dwight, you've earned it. No, thanks. What? Not my style. But you said you liked it. You've always admired it. And But that was before. I'm thinking about getting something German, something with decent gas mileage. Plus, that convertible is a ridiculous choice for this climate. Take it back. No. That's my car. What did you That's my car! Yes. I know, Dwight, I know. I know, I know. You know what? Jan called me about your little meeting! No. I know what you did. You The Sebring's cool I made the whole thing up, Dwight! It's cool, the Sebring's cool Oh, do you? Do you like it? And has a cassette and a CD. How dare you? How dare you, Dwight? Don't fire me. Please, don't Give me one good reason why I shouldn't fire you right here on the spot? I have excellent sales numbers! Not good enough! I'll do anything! Anything! Please, I'll do your laundry for a month! For a year! I have a laundry machine! I'm sorry. Anything I'II Please? Please? I don't know if I can trust you anymore. You can't. You can't, but I promise I'll never betray you again. What can I do, Michael? What can I do? What can I do? What can I do? What can I do? You can get up. What? Get up. And you can hug it out, bitch. "Hug it out, bitch. " That is what men say to each other after a fight. They hug it out. And in doing so, they just let it go. And walk away, and they're done. Not a good idea to say that to a woman, however, I have found. Doesn't translate. Yup, yup, we hugged it out. But it turns out I was still a little angry and so I felt I needed to punish him just a little bit more. And I'm making him do my laundry for a year. So, do you want to see it or not? I don't know. They're, like, Friday night crowds Oh, my God. You're, like, agoraphobic. Agoraphobic? Yeah. Really. Yeah. You would rather sit on your couch and watch a Phillies game than go out to a movie with your awesome girlfriend. Absolutely correct. Later, Jim. Kev, have a good weekend. Yeah, sure. Bye. Okay, so this is what's gonna happen. You're going to suck it up. Here we go. And we're gonna go to dinner. Okay. And then we're gonna go to the movies. Sounds good. Hey, Halpert. Hey. Roy! Roy! God! Pam, please call security. Every day for eight years, I have brought pepper spray into this office to protect myself and my fellow employees. And every day, for eight years, people have laughed at me. Well, who's laughing now? No need for consternation. Everything is under control. Michael, last Friday, one of your employees attacked another employee in your office. It was a crime of passion, Jan. Not a disgruntled employee. Everyone here is extremely gruntled. Is Toby there? No. I'm here, Jan. What is the situation, Toby? Well, we fired Roy, obviously. And Jim won't press charges against Roy or the company. Thank God. Yeah. But now, apparently, Darryl has some issue with this No, he has been wanting a raise for a couple of months, and he's just using this Roy thing as leverage. Well, are you gonna take care of this? Yeppers. What did I tell you about "yeppers"? I don't remember. I told you not to say it. Do you remember that? Yesh. I really don't want to talk about it. I don't mean to be rude. But I just, I don't want to comment on what happened. It sucked. I guess all things considered, I was lucky Dwight was there. And Roy was lucky that Dwight only used pepper spray, and not the nunchakus or the throwing stars. Hey, man, I never got a chance to thank you for stopping Roy. Thank you. "Thank you" not necessary and thus not accepted. I saw someone breaking the law and I interceded. Okay. Got you something. Don't want it. You don't know what it is. Don't want it, won't open it, don't need it, won't take it. Citizens do not accept prizes for being citizens. It was a little glass display case for his bobblehead. That would have made his evening, I think. He saves my life, I get him a box for his desk toy. Even-Steven. No, don't call me a hero. Do you know who the real heroes are? The guys who wake up every morning and go into their normal jobs, and get a distress call from the Commissioner and take off their glasses and change into capes and fly around fighting crime. Those are the real heroes. Angela, Roy's check. He's coming in later to pick it up. Man, I cannot believe I missed the fight. It was crazy. Man. You saw it? Describe it, please. Well I heard some shouting, and I look over and Roy's by reception, and you could just tell he's gonna punch somebody. Jim says something, Roy stops over there, all of a sudden, bam, Roy goes down and Dwight's standing there like an action hero. Oh. It was insane. Well, good for Dwight. Okay, I want you to be Darryl and ask me for a raise because I need to try out some of these negotiation tactics on you. Where'd you get that? Wikipedia. Wikipedia is the best thing ever. Anyone in the world can write anything they want about any subject, so you know you are getting the best possible information. Okay, Darryl, ask me for a raise. Hey, Mike, since Roy left I've been doing a lot more work and I need a raise. Well, that's interesting, Darryl. I think that maybe you should Can't hear you. What I'm saying is that Still nothing. Okay. See what I did? No. By leaning back and by whispering, I established a dominant physical position. Nice. Okay, let's try another one. Okay. Walking out of the room unexpectedly. And what happens in this one? That's a surprise. Okay. Go ahead, ask me for a raise. Can I have a raise? Sex. Steve Martin. Teri Hatcher. What? What? Well, what did you say? I didn't say anything. I was waiting to see what would happen. No, it's It sounded interesting, what you were gonna I saw the perpetrator advance towards the victim at a high rate of speed. His head was thrown back, his shoulder and arm cocked, indicating an attack position. Perp grabbed the victim. I removed my weapon from its secure hiding place. Which is where? Irrelevant. Discharged it at a distance of a little over a meter into the perpetrator's eyes, nose and face area, rendering him utterly and completely disabled. Then I contacted the authorities. The end. Thanks, Dwight. That is the bravest thing I have ever heard. I can't imagine what I would have done. I can. You would have left me to fend for myself. Like the time we were on the Ferris wheel, and that kid dropped a milkshake on me and you just laughed. Well, that was funny. That's why. Oh, it was? Okay, well, the next time that you get scared that you think a murderer is in your apartment in the middle of the night, and you call me to calm you down Okay, you know what, I Could you stop?  you can just call somebody else because I'm not going to do it anymore, Ryan. I'm not. Well, don't talk to me about calling There's a bunch of people back here. I call you in the middle of the night Guys. to tell you that I love you. I don't think Michael intended to punish me by putting Ryan back here with Kelly. But if he did intend that Wow. Genius. Yeah? You ready for me? Yes, yeah. Absolutely. Have a seat. You know what, actually, let's go into the conference room. Okay. No, you know what, let's stay here. Let's go. Yeah, let's go to the conference room. Tactic number six. Change the location of the meeting at the last second. Totally throws them off. Number 14, declining to speak first. Makes them feel uncomfortable, puts you in control. I am declining to speak first. Okay, I'll start. It's pretty simple, really. I think I deserve a raise. I'm scheduled to get one in six months, but I'd like that to be moved up to now. Darryl, you are a good worker and a good man. I just You know, times are tight, and I just don't think corporate's going to go for this right now. Are you wearing lady clothes? What? Are you wearing lady clothes? Those look like lady pants. No. This is a power suit. That there is a woman's suit. I do not buy women's clothes. Do not make that mistake again. I'm going to call Roy, man. Okay. All right. This is going to make him feel better. This is too good. All right. You know what, Pam, would you please tell Darryl that this is not a woman's suit? Oh, my God. That's a woman's suit. You're wearing a woman's suit? No. I do I wear men's suits. Okay? I got this out of a bin. There were these huge bins of clothes, and everybody was riffling through them like crazy. And I grabbed one. And it fit. So I don't think that this is totally just a woman's suit. At the very least, it's bisexual. Who makes it? It is mysterious, because the buttons are on the wrong side. That's the mystery. Look, it's got shoulder pads. And did you see that lining? Okay. Did you see that? Would you stop it, please? So none of that tipped you off? It's European, okay? It's a European cut. Michael, the pants don't have any pockets. No, they don't, see? Italians don't wear pockets. It's been a really rough couple of days. This helps a little. Hey, maybe you want to come over and raid my closet? No, I don't want to do that because I'm twice your size anyway. Yeah, he look like Hillary Clinton. Let's just do this in 15. Okay, can you stand right there for one second? I got to send some e-mails. Negotiations are all about controlling things, about being in the driver's seat. And you make one tiny mistake, you're dead. I made one tiny mistake. I wore women's clothes. So, Karen, how do you feel that Roy tried to kick your boyfriend's ass over another woman? I feel great, Kevin. Thank you. You must have been scared out of your mind. Well, you know, it happened so fast, I didn't really have time to be scared. What happened, exactly? I wasn't here. So I haven't really heard the whole story. Well, Jim and I were talking. And Roy walked in, looking super angry. And he's a big dude, you know? And all of a sudden, Jim pushed me out of the way and Roy cocked his fist. And then? And then, bam, Dwight sprays him and knocks him on his butt. Goodness. When I heard Jim and Pam had kissed, my reaction was to have lots of long talks with Jim about our feelings. Roy just attacked him. I'm not sure which one Jim hated more. Let's get down to business. Why don't you tell me why you think you deserve a raise. Well, it's simple, Mike. I mean, we merged these two branches, right? So now we're shipping twice as many orders as we used to. And with Roy gone, we've got a smaller crew. And I'm picking up all of his slack, so I think I should be compensated fairly by getting a raise. Well, those are very good points. What? I can't hear you. Those are very good points. I can't What, Mike? Are you You make a very compelling argument. Sorry I almost got you killed. Yeah. That was nuts. He could have broken your nose or something. Crazy. It's just so stupid. I mean, getting back with Roy and everything. I mean, what I was thinking, right? No, I mean, you guys really seem to have a strong connection. Not anymore. It's completely over now. We'll see. I'm sure you guys will find your way back to one another someday. Jim. I am really sorry. Oh, yeah. Don't worry about it. I'm going to give you a piece of paper. I want you to write down how much you want. Then I want you to slide it back across the desk to me. Why can't I just tell you? Because that is the way these things are done in films. Now slide it. Yes. There you go. Oh, come on. Be serious. I am serious, Mike. That's a 10-percent raise. That's what I want. I can't give you that. I don't make this much. Come on, be for real, Mike. I don't. I'll prove it to you. There is a pay stub. Are you serious? You're earning this? Plus perks. Yes. Mike, this is barely more than I make. You've been here ten years, dawg. Fourteen years. No, please, please don't. I'm sorry, Mike. Some mofos got to hear about this one. Okay. Let's take 15 again. A boss' salary isn't just about money. It is about perks. It For example, every year I get a $100 gas card. Can't put a price tag on that. Okay. If you don't want a gift, at least let me buy you a beer or lunch or something. When Han Solo returns to the Death Star in the Millennium Falcon, and shoots down the TIE fighters and saves the Rebel cause, do you think he does so for a free beer? Boy, I No. And why are you so interested in buying me something, Jim? What's your angle? It's like when he annoys me and I want to screw with him to get him back, he never sees it coming. But now I want to be nice to him and actually give him something, and he's like an eel. I just can't grab onto him. It's infuriating. Maybe you just feel guilty about all the pranks. No. Yes. That's probably what it is. So what do I do? I don't know. Maybe you should go back out there and sell paper so we can go on a trip. Michael? Here's the $15 I owe you. Thank you. Yeah. I heard you might need it, so Here's the $40 you gave me. I didn't give you $40. In a way, you did. Yeah. I heard how much Michael makes. I still think he's way overpaid. Fourteen years. Fourteen. I know. Okay, all right, I got to go. Late. Okay. Okay. Here's the straight dope. No tricks, no Wikipedia. What? I talked to corporate and they told me that I can only give you a five-percent raise. That's 'cause of you, Mike. They're not going to give the working man more than the boss. Well, what am I supposed to do? Get your own raise. You've got to get out there and earn, son. I'm not going to go out and ask for a raise right now. That is ridiculous. Well, when they merged the two branches together, they put you in charge. Okay? And we're shipping more now than we ever have. That's true. Yeah, that's true. You got to call your girl and get paid. Show her who wears the pants in the relationship. You know what, I should. Yeah, you should. I've been a loyal employee for a long time. Fourteen years long. You know what, I deserve a bump. Make it happen, Captain. I am making it happen, Sergeant. I remember it was very late at night, like 11:00, 11:30. Big fella comes in screaming about God knows what. I think maybe Halpert had stolen his car, something like that. So the big fella pulls out a sock filled with nickels. Then Schrute grabs a can of hairspray and a lighter You're useless. Well, why don't we talk next month after the quarter ends? No, Jan. I've never asked for a raise in 14 years. This is long overdue. I want to do it today. Today? All right, well, if you want to do it today, we should do it in person, and can you get here by 5:00? Yeah. Yeah, I'll leave right away. Great. And listen, because of our, you know, situation, we're going to need to have a third party present. Yes. I'm bringing Darryl. Darryl from the warehouse? Mmm-hmm. No, Michael, we We need an HR rep, so I think you should just bring Toby. Hey, I'd rather kill myself. Michael, he's your branch's HR rep No, Toby is terrible. and we need someone else in the room Toby is the worst human being I've ever known. because of our relationship. Michael! Either Toby comes with you or we don't do it. Fine. You are so mean. I don't know what you're talking about. Yes, you do, Ryan Bailey Howard. You called me stupid. No. I said Toby, come on, let's go. Where? Where? I'm going to smack you in the head with a hammer. Come on, let's go. What is so stupid about wanting to name a baby Usher? All right. Usher Jennifer Hudson Kapour. Don't you see why that's insane? Oh, so I'm crazy now? Comfortable, Mike? Yeah. What about you, man, you comfortable? No. Don't ever touch a black man's radio. Chris Tucker, Rush Hour. I won't touch yours, by the way. Thank you. I haven't been to New York in a long time. Big Apple. Maybe I'll stay overnight. I got a cousin who lives down there. How will we get home? Oh, you can stay, too. He's got a big place. Maybe I'll stay. It's not that big. Buses, though, will get you home quick. And then all of a sudden Dwight stood up and was like, "No!" Then what did he do? Well, you should just read the report that Toby did. He took everyone's stories. Dunder Mifflin, customer service. This is Kelly. Oh, yeah, I can totally help you with that. Okay. Let me just get the folder out. Okay, it seems here that you ordered 12,000 reams of paper. Oh, 12 reams? Hey, guys. Jan is ready for you. Okay. Okay. Bring it home now. And don't forget the new black-man phrase I taught you. Pippety poppety, give me the zoppety. Yes, sir. Remember that. I'll be right outside if you need me. All right. Yeah. I taught Mike some new phrases. I want him to get the raise. I just can't help myself. Hey, man I'm sorry. Thanks. Can I, like, see you after work for coffee or something? I don't know. Please. I just got some stuff I got to say to you. Jim. Roy. Look out! Thanks, Kev. I'm good, though. Thank you, Hunter. Hello. Come in. Okay. Who is the boy toy? That's my new assistant. Were you going to tell me that you hired James Van Der Beek? I have to call you the second I get a new assistant now? Be nice to get a memo. We are lovers. Hi, Jan. Hi, Toby. First First off, Michael, this is a salary negotiation. All matters regarding our personal relationship have to be set aside. Are we clear? Bippety, boppety. Right now, we can offer you a six-percent raise. Six percent? After all we've been through? Oh, God. I got you jade earrings. Michael. No. No. No. Michael. You're going to play it like this? You give me a good raise or no more sex. What are you writing, perv-ball? Just preparing for the deposition. This may the first time that a male subordinate has attempted to get a modest, scheduled raise by threatening to withhold sex from a female superior. It will be a groundbreaking case when it inevitably goes to trial. I'm so sorry, Pammy. I mean, I wasn't going to do anything, but then I kept thinking about you two together. I just thought you guys were really good friends or maybe he was gay or something. Not that that's wrong. I'm sorry, too. I just I think that we both made some bad choices. So, you going to start dating Halpert then? No. No. He has a girlfriend. Oh, yeah. Wait a minute, you broke up our wedding for the guy. No. There were a lot of reasons. What, you're not even going to try to go out with him? I don't get you, Pam. I know. What's this? What's what? "Certificate of Bravery from the Scranton Police Department "recognizing outstanding citizenship from a very brave young man, "Dwight K. Schrute. " Wow. I guess word got around. That's a nice honor. Please. They hand these out to little kids. Look, there's a teddy bear in a policeman's cap. Didn't think you'd notice. Why don't you just take that pen and stab me in the heart? This is me, Jan. This is me. Okay. Michael, please. You know, why don't we just take a break? Okay. This is This is going nowhere. No. No. No. You do not try tactic number eight on me. I invented tactic number eight. I'm not going anywhere. Okay, Toby, how about if you Sure. Great. What's wrong with you? I don't know. Was a weird day. I accidentally cross-dressed. And then Darryl made me feel bad for not making any money. And then I had to ride up here with stupid Toby. And then your assistant is all young and hot and I Okay, Michael. I can offer you a 12-percent raise, but you have got to ask for 15. That's ridiculous. I'm never going to No, just I just need you to ask for it so I can record that you asked for it. Okay? Ah so. All right, Levinson, here's the rub. I would like a 15-percent raise. No, but we can offer you 12. But you just said 15. Negotiation is an art. Back and forth. Give and take. And today, both Darryl and I took something. Higher salaries. Win, win, win. But, you know, life is about more than just salary. It's about perks. Like having sex with Jan Michael. So, you and Bob are looking at a historical house? Near the river. How many bedrooms? Four. Dwight. Dwight. I've been doing some very interesting reading. Really? Tales of bravery. Good stuff? I was thinking tonight we could read it together. That sounds fun. I will never say a word. And now we are even. I graduated from anger management the same way I graduated from Cornell. On time. Now I'm back, got a second chance and I'm not going to blow it. So, look out, Dunder Mifflin. I mean "look out" in a fun way. You know, not like, "I'm going to hurt you. " Hey, guys, guess who's back? Oh, God! No need to thank me. I'm not a hero. I'm a mere defender of the office. You know who's a real hero? Hiro from Heroes. That's a hero. Also Bono. This morning, the phone guy comes in, and he shows Michael that our phones have a P.A. function. And then he just left. This is your captain speaking. The office will be flying at an altitude of two stories. Look out your left-hand window, and you will see Vance Refrigeration. I am the ghost of salesmen past. Do not come near me! Yes, Michael Scott for Dr. Jocelyn, please. Hello, Doctor. I was just following up about my mole again. No, I was looking online about sebaceous cysts. I have not been squeezing it. Could I stick it with a pin? Toby Flenderson to the principal's office. Your mother called. And it appears that you wet the bed again. So you have to get home to wash your sheets because they're yellow and they're wet with your urine. You And at 6'6" from the University of North Carolina, Jim Halpert! That's pretty funny. You know what? Did I drop my - What? - What the heck - Is that - You find it? I didn't. I'll look somewhere else. Would you like fries with that? Please drive around. Proofreading: So. &amp; Valpi Episode 5x14 "Lecture Circuit (Part 1)" - Good morning. - Morning. You ready? And we're off! Like a herd of turtles. Pam and I have eloped. Actually, we just robbed a bank, and we are on the lam. Seriously, I am on a lecture circuit. Apparently, Scranton has the best sales of any regional branch. So David Wallace has asked me to go to all the branches except Nashua, so a little bit raw there But I am going to these branches and I am telling them my secret recipe for success. My 11 business herbs and spices in a sales batter. That. Well, that is Pam. Pam is coming along as my assistant and my driver so I can focus. And I like to pack heavy. He brought a sled. That is a toboggan. You never know when you're gonna find a snowy hill. Every magician has a hot assistant, and every rock star has a roadie, and Pam is my hot roadie. I love being on the road. but I especially love the time-and-a-half pay, 'Cause I have a mortgage now. Gotta bring home the bucks. Don't say "bucks." That's not ladylike. Here we go! So, what we do is we drive all day - and stay in hotels together at night. - Separate rooms. - That goes without saying. - I'm gonna say it anyway. Look at what you're wearing again. Have you ever seen a magician's assistant? - This is a new cardigan. - Kind of Maybe you could tie it around your waist or lose the shirt underneath or something. Screw you. Excuse me. That is no way to address a superior. Screw you, too. - What was that all about? - You forgot her birthday. It was yesterday. Go ahead. You do it. I insist. After Phyllis blackmailed Angela, Michael asked them both to step down from the party committee 'cause there was too much drama. - What he said was - Easy. There was a problem with having one head of the party committee. She becomes too powerful, so he appointed two heads. - Party-planning is - I am a salesman. - the stupidest thing I've ever done. - This is humiliating. That's on my side. So this is fun. My birthday was yesterday and everybody forgot. I got really dressed up and excited, and no one said a word. There wasn't even a party. I think sometimes people are really mean to the hot, popular girl. Can I turn on the radio? I need silence or Sam Kinison to prepare. But then you fall asleep and there's nothing for me to do. Then listen to your iPod. - That's dangerous. - Well, then You know what? Let's just talk. That's OK. I can I'm fine. I'll just play a song in my head. You're nervous about seeing Karen again? Since she was the other woman? Actually, you were the other woman, so. That was a long time ago. Is that why you're wearing makeup today? I'm not even wearing that much. I hate the idea that someone out there hates me. I even hate thinking that Al-Qaeda hates me. I think if they got to know me, they wouldn't hate me. But Karen knows me and she still hates me, so. This is a nice office. You don't have to lie. Through here. - Who's that? - She's out of your league. For your information, I've been with lots of beautiful women. Sexually? This conversation is over. I am single now. What we have here is the ultimate smackdown between the Nard-Dog and crippling despair, loneliness, and depression. I intend to win. We wanted to say we are very sorry. - Screw you. You're dead to me. - If you say "screw you" one more Screw you. I don't forget your birthday. - I would never do that. - Guys, guys. We want to make it up. What can we do? I guess my only wish would be that nothing so terrible would ever happen to anyone else ever again. It's good that it happened to me because at least I can bear it. What kind of cake do you want, imbecile? Ice cream. Point at the Dunder Mifflin. Hello, Rolando. How are you? I'd like you to meet Pam. She is our receptionist. You know what? Maybe you guys could go out on a little friend date sometime. You're late. Everyone's waiting in the conference room. Karen will be right here to take you over. Don't be nervous. - Just picture her naked. - Stop it. - That's what I do. Steal my trick. - Please, cut it out. Hi, guys. - Is that Jim's? - What? Of course not. My head just exploded. Thank god. For everybody, right? You're huge! That's incredible! God. Sorry. Sorry, my head is I'm just I'm trying to figure out the last time that you and Jim had sex. Let's just get this over with, shall we? Ten. Ten months? Are you kidding? I'm not done yet. This fits in the palm of my hand. You haven't blown 'em up enough. Why have you chosen brown and gray balloons? They match the carpet. What is that? "It is your birthday", period. It's a statement of fact. - Not even an exclamation point? - This is more professional. It's not like she discovered a cure for cancer. I can't believe how bad this looks. Are you trying to hurt my feelings? Because if so, you are succeeding. Fortunately, my feelings regenerate at twice the speed of a normal man's. - Good then. - Have you collected the money? - I am working on it. - How much do you have? $6. That's how much you and I contributed! Damn it! I said I was working on it. Trying to see what CDs she's got. It's good to know the deets about the girl you're wooing. Feist. That is so awful. That is the worst news. I have to go. I have to do a presentation. I'll talk to you This is going to be hard for me to speak today because I just learned that my father has died. He didn't! He is alive. And this isn't even a cell phone. This is a calculator. But you bought it! And now you can't return it. Or can you? No, you can't. Do you need to go pump? Not gonna have to do that till after I have the baby. I am wondering, what are you talking about? I am talking about how you all need to sell an experience. Like I sold you one The idea that my father had died. But now we think you're a liar. Would a liar bring mini mounds bars? I am a theatrical person. Growing up, I always thought I would become an actor because I have these memorization tricks that I use. For instance, I learned the pledge of allegiance by setting it to the tune of Old MacDonald. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America And to the republic for which it stands One nation under God With a woof-woof here And a woof-woof there Here a woof, there a woof, Everywhere a woof, woof You get it. I don't know you. But I need to know you in order to sell to you. That is why I have asked you to go around and tell me your names. I have an amazing pneumonic device by which I have now memorized all of your names. Shirty. Mole. Lazy eye. Mexico. Baldy. Sugar boobs. Black woman. I have taken a unique part of who you are, and I have used that to memorize your name. Baldy. Your head is bald. It is hairless. It is shiny. It is reflective. Like a mirror. "M." Your name is Mark. Got it. It works. It's very insulting. But it works. I would like you to give this a shot. What do you say? But we already know each other's names. Then it will be easier for you. But I still think it's worthwhile to give it a try. All right, everyone. Meeting's over. I still have more. Can I please see you in my office, please? She is pregnant. She is knocked up. "K." Karen. Pam, let's go. I can't accept these prices. They just cut our budget. Brought you guys some coffees. Stanley, I know you have adult onset diabetes so I put Splenda in yours. How many did I put in there? One, two, three, four Splendas in your coffee, Stanley None in yours, Julia 'cause I don't know how you take it But if you'd rather Four Splenda. Are you crazy? I actually only put in two but that's not how the song goes. - Are you out of your damn mind? - Are you out of your damn mind? You bring an angel like that into this office and you don't even set me up with her. We're not friends. I didn't think about it. We are friends. We're friends. And you let me down. You really like her, huh? I really like her with all my heart. Give me two clients for her. I grab this, and I turn it on and I say, "Prepare yourself "for the Utica chain store massacre!" That is incredibly dangerous. - Don't worry. The chain is off. - No, it's not. I think I'm just gonna distill all of this and send it in an email to my team. Email's not scary. This is an opportunity. - Don't blow it. - So, when are you due? In about a month. That is wonderful. Congratulations. It just all happened so fast. It's really amazing. Congratulations. So, is there a guy or a person or a sperm machine that did this to you or? My husband impregnated me. His name is Dan. - This is us. So dorky. - He's cute. He's a dermatologist. We met at a bar. Can you believe that? - What is happening there? - Yeah. Don't even. That's really dorky. - It's really sweet. - No, it's really dorky. You were right the first time. So how are things in Scranton? - How's Jim? - They're good. Jim's good. We're engaged. That's so great. That's great. I'm so happy for you. Old hatreds dissolve into new friendships. It's a really wonderful moment. I have to take care of things, so Andy will be taking over things here. You're in good hands and give my best to your mother. Let's see. With regards to billing, should we send bills to you or to your boyfriend's house? No, it could go straight to our business address. That makes sense. How does your boyfriend deal with your phenomenal success? Is he just, like, totally threatened by you or Actually, I don't have a boyfriend. Really? Is that That's so weird. Stop everything. I'm about to ask out this girl and I'm completely panicking. My desk is over This gal She's really into you? I mean, I've seen her, like, three times today, and we love all the same music, and whenever I walk into a room she totally looks up. Say no more. This is how I got Squeaky Fromme. No small talk. Just show her who's the boss. Just go right in and kiss her. It sounds risky. Have I ever steered you wrong, Jim? Wait, what? I would give that lecture a solid B+. Although, for the record, Karen - Kind of mean. - I like her. Really? No, honestly. Tell me what you really think. I'm serious. - I'm really glad I came. - Why? Because 'Cause I'll never wonder ever again if I did something wrong and now I have closure. She's happy and I don't know, it feels good. - Thanks for walking me out. - My pleasure. There's all kinds of weirdoes out here, so. - You must be freezing. - I am about to die. Will you wait here while I go get my jacket? No, it's OK. this is my car. Listen. You're a new client, and as one of my new clients, you will always be taken care of. And that is the Nard-Dog guarantee. What's a "Nard-Dog"? This is the Nard-Dog. What the hell? I'm sorry. I thought we had this energy and I'm a mess, and I just had my heart broken, and you came in today and you're so pretty. - You're incredibly pretty. - I just got out of a relationship, too. - It's really hard. - Right! Do you want to talk about it? Go to a mall or something, - just walk around? - I don't think so. That's You're right. It's too soon. Definitely too soon for me. So, I'm glad we got that out of the way. I'm gonna be in touch with you in three months. I'm gonna call you about that order and maybe about that mall walk. Take care, Julia. Sorry I tried to kiss you. We lost the account. Damn it. - How old's Kelly? - Who is this? It's Mose. Who do you think it is? Mose doesn't know how to use a phone, so joke's on you. They only have numbered candles. How old is she? Do you think I'm calling you for your best approximation? I'll call you back. I have here Kelly Kapoor's personal and confidential file. Allow me to share. "Kelly Kapoor spent April 1995 to December 1996 "at Berks County Youth Center." Juvie. "According to past employers, it in no way affects her job perform" Are you asleep? I'm just thinking about what you said. About Karen, about closure. You remember Holly? She used to work for H.R. Remind me. Blonde hair. Nice boobs. Not too big, not too small. Perfect boobs. Of course I remember Holly. She was the love of my life. What you and Jim have times 100. Just she She just left. And I didn't I never got closure, you know? I never got closure with her. I haven't talked to her since. I haven't seen her since. And I feel like I need to go to Nashua and get closure. I feel like I need that. Let's go. I'll just blow off the lecture at Rochester. Screw 'em. Let's do this. I'm collecting $3 from everybody for Kelly's party. - I'd like to contribute. - Great. There you go. Parkour! - Michael-- - Parkour! Parkour! - Extreme! Parkour! - Parkour! This is parkour. Internet sensation of 2004 And it was in one of the bond films. It's pretty impressive. The goal is to get from point "a" to point "b" as creatively as possible. So technically they are doing parkour As long as point "a" is delusn and point "b" is the hospital. Parkour! - Yeah! Parkour! - Okay, here we go! Andy, leapfrog! Go, go! - Do me! Do me! - Yeah, okay!

Um-- See those files behind kevin's desk? - Mm-Hmm. - Go put them all in random order. - Okay. - Then come back here For your next assignment concerning their order. This is the last day of our summer interns. It's been nice. We haven't had interns in a while Ever since michael's monica lewinsky incident. He didn't do anything sexual. He just made far, far too many monica lewinsky jokes. It was just easier for corporate to shutdown the program. - Think she did him? - I bet there's something there. I was with them in the kitchen yesterday and they were all too happy to be cleaning the freezer. If they get married before i do, i'm gonna kill myself. Who's getting married? Nobody. Somebody doesn't tell me, i'm gonna start screaming. - It's eric and megan. - Oh, hey, i hired them. Matchmaker. This place is like spaniard fly. They're not getting married. It's just talk. Did everybody know about this but me? There's nothing to know. It's just gossip. Okay. Okay. We haven't told anyone that i'm pregnant. What with her being unmarried. Knocked up by some guy. I mean, the yakkity-Yaks in this office would have a field day. Yeah, and we don't want them at the wedding Thinking jim's being marched down the aisle by my dad with a shotgun. Wait, there's not gonna be a shotgun? - Nope. - No shotgun? 'Cause that changes everything. Can't back out now, halpert. What are you gonna do about it? There's no shotgun, so Free at last. Free at last. No, keep it up. - You'll never guess what i know. - Okay, let me finish this thought. Eric likes megan. He most definitely does. He's been asking her out repeatedly for weeks. She finally said yes. They went out on a quick date the other night. Apparently it went very well. - How do you know this? - People tell me things. I guess i have a face you can trust. I think it's because of my low cheekbones. And boom. Okay, what is it? What can't i guess? I hate, hate, hate being left out. Whether it's not being picked for a team Or being picked for a team and then showing up And realizing that the team doesn't exist Or that the sport doesn't exist. I should have known. Poopball? Oh, man, i know how you feel. Third wheel. I have been the third wheel so many times in my life. My mom told me something once that made me feel a lot better. She said the third wheel is what makes it a tricycle. What are you talking about? I am talking about your group date with megan and eric. - At tink's? - Yes. - How'd you know about that? - Well-- Did stanley tell you? Stanley was on your group date? No, stanley was with his wife. I waved at him but he didn't wave back. Does anybody else know about this? No. There he goes. There he goes. So what is the scuttlebutt? Anybody hear anything? Nothing? I got a little something-Something. I don't know if i should say. - So just keep it to yourself then. - Stanley is having a midlife crisis. Stanley is way past the middle of his life, Especially considering his height to weight ratio. Well, apparently he and his wife Were out dancing at a club for young people. Teri's out of town, michael. - Who? - Stanley's wife teri. She's at an interior decorating expo in philly. And stanley hates crowds, kids, and music. I think you should check your facts. You stupid son of a bitch. You set me up. - What are you talking about? - Stanley's wife is out of town. - He was with somebody. - He was definitely with someone. Oh, was he? Well, who, his sister? I don't get it! If that was his sister, then what they were doing was totally illegal. Drugs? Making out. Oh, okay. Well-- Oh, no, okay. No, it's okay. Never mind. Carry on. Stanley is having an affair. - What? - I know. I am very happy right now, Thrilled perhaps, to be a part of the office, To be a part of the conversation. When you have somebody's attention and their eyes are lighting up Because they are very interested in what you have to say, That is a great feeling and i experienced that firsthand today. It is wonderful to be the center of attention. That and that are the same letter. "Q." No. No, okay. He's holding a pencil. He could be doing a crossword puzzle with that pencil. What's that letter right there? Same letter here and here. What haven't you guessed? - "T." - "T," yes! Yes! That is a "t" and there's another one right there. Just sound that out. Ou're almost there. Hey, stanley, where you going, big guy? Up to no good? I'm meeting a client. Do you have a problem with that? No, no, no, no, no. I just had a quick question for you. I'm casting a movie and i'm looking for a woman who can dance. Beautiful woman. Do you know anybody? Good-Bye. Pays $5 million. Nudity required. - You have to stop this. - Did you hear? Stanley's having an affair. I did from you. You got to stop telling people. Oh, okay, i get it. You feel out of the loop and you feel sorry for yourself And it's really sad because everybody thinks you're a loser. Do you even know if it's true? Do you have any idea? Because you might be ruining his life. Hold up! Hold up! Hold up! Hold up! No, no, no, no, no! Time to stop being polite and get real. Stanley, you having an affair? That is ridiculous. Of course not. Why would you think that? So it's not true. Okay. Well-- Oh. Those interns. They told me they saw you at the club And they all said it was you. It was clearly just - Racial profiling gossip. The little-- - Damn! - Told her it was a stupid idea to go up in that club. - That's so stupid. It's just that - Teri's been traveling a lot lately - I know. I know. - It's been lonely. - Oh, i bet. Cynthia's been keeping me company. She was my nurse when i was in rehabilitation. We used to go on these long walks on the treadmill. - I didn't intend-- - Wait, wait, wait. Ho--Hol-- So it is true? Yeah, but, michael, i'm going to go break it off. - That's where i'm headed right now, i swear. - Oh, my god. Wait a second. Do people often say they're going on sales calls and then go someplace else? 'Cause that's not cool. I just need you to promise not to say a word about this to anyone. Michael, please. - I'm not saying a damn thing. - I'm counting on you, michael. Okay. ??? Oh, that smells good. Yeah, i might have extra. It just depends on how many i eat. - Did you hear about angela? That's pretty weird. - Yeah. Well, what do you mean exactly? Well, the fact that she apparently is dating an 81-Year-Old billionaire Who owns a quiznos on the turnpike. - Really? - Uh-Huh. Right? How do you untell something? You can't. You can't put words back in your mouth. What you can do is spread false gossip So that people think that everything that's been said is untrue, Including stanley is having an affair. It's like the end of spartacus. I have seen that movie half a dozen times And i still don't know who the real spartacus is. And that is what makes that movie a classic whodunit. - Kelly has an eating disorder. - Yeah. - She always eats my lunch. - Anorexia. She's ana-- She's an "anorexitec." - We should do something. - Nothing can be done. Just have to tell everybody and hope for the best, i guess. I'm worried about erin because she's not a very good worker. I don't know how long she's gonna last here. - Really? - Yeah. So--And andy is gay. - Andy bernard? - Mm-Hmm. Did you hear pam is pregnant? - Really? - Yeah. She's gonna hate being a mom. What? Tea. - So? - You would. I like tea. Oh, i bet you like it. Yeah. I like it a lot. I love tea. Do you like it as much as you like men's butts? What? 'Cause you're gay. Who told you that? Was it broccoli rob? Someone from chi psi? Or did you run into someone from my high school? This is not the first time rumors about me being gay have come up. Twice before, actually. Just a weird coincidence. It's a little too weird. Almost makes you wonder if it's not a coincidence at all. Whoa. Which it is, of course. But it makes you wonder. Did you hear the rumor about me? That i'm gay? - I did. Yes. - And? - What? Do you think it's true? Do you think that i'm gay? Are you attracted to other men? No. But let me kick you a scenario. I'm at, like, a beach cabana And brad pitt approaches, tries to lean in and kiss me. I would definitely resist, like, at first. But if he was persistent, i might give in a little bit To just really see what it felt like. Would i push him away? How hard? Like, what if he's, like, really aggressive? If you resisted brad pitt a little bit, He would still need to get to you? This is not real brad pitt. This is, like, in my-- This is my fantasy. Or it's, like, not fantasy. It's, like, what i'm-- It's just a scenario. Wow. I--I am-- I wish i could help you. I don't-- You might be gay. You might be gay. What exactly is my responsibility here? To comfort insecure heterosexual men? That can't possibly fall to me. - How far along is pam? - A few months that's why they're rushing the wedding. Guys, guys, guys. You can't believe everything you hear. Like stanley having an affair. That is crazy. Just there's no stock in it. It's a weird day for false facts. Let it go. Okay, everybody. Big day. Last day for our interns. Lot of other stuff. Who knows what to believe? Dwight, the honors. Present these to the dean for credit. And as a gift, i've attached my card. Call me anytime of the day or night. Why would we call you at night? Well, now you can't call me at all, so problem solved. And you're gonna regret that when you find yourself between a moose and her cubs at night. Look to the intern on your left. Now to your right. One of you will do exceedingly well in business. Just unlimited potential. One of you will make a living and nothing more. And one of you will make a great mother. It's up to you to choose which you want to be. - I am so happy you're eating again. - Me too. Dude, how come you never try to set me up? Oh, i don't really do that. But pam might have some friends though. - Women friends? - Yep. Not guy friends? - Are you interested in her guy friends? - No. - I mean, for the record, i prefer women. - Okay. But off the record, i'm kind of confused. Really? Yeah, the evidence is sort of stacked against me, i feel like. - Well, you got to figure this out. - Yeah, right? - Yeah. - How? You got to have sex with a woman - Right-O. - And then a man and then compare. Oh. All right. - Well, hey. - Yep? - Congratulations to you. - On what? Come on. Little baby tuna. Little junior toro. You know, a baby conceived out of wedlock is still a bastard. What? - Want me to say it again? - Why did that come into your brain? Can i talk to you for a second? So they know. - Who did you tell? - I didn't tell anyone. - Who did you tell? - Nobody. Hey, did one of you tell stanley that i have asthma, 'cause i don't. If it gets out, they won't let me scuba. If i can't scuba, then what's this all been about? What am i working toward? What? You think i'm the voice of the taco bell dog? What are you guys talking about? I have a daughter. How could i be a virgin? Has everyone heard a crazy rumor about themselves today? Yeah, yeah. You know what? Let's discredit these rumors. Yeah, sure, but who's been saying all that stuff? That's not important, jim. I just think we shouldn't listen to any of this crap. Sure, but we should get to the bottom of this. Let's pick a rumor and trace it back to the beginning. I need to do mine first. Who's been saying that there's another person inside of me Working me with controls? I heard that from andy. I heard it from erin. I heard it from michael. Michael Michael? He's over here! - Where you going? - Nowhere. - Michael. - Hmm? You told people that i use store-Bought manure When i showed you where my manure comes from. Hmm? Hmm? - Don't get on it. - Michael, don't. - Don't get on. - Michael. - Do not. - Michael, no. - Stay, michael. - Step away. - Stay. - Don't. - Come on, boss. - No, no. - Okay, i made it all up. - What? - Even the fact that i'm gay? - Yes. Yes. But, guys, i'm a victim here too, okay? People have been saying that i am a j. Crew model. No, we heard that about jim. Jim? No, no. I spread the rumor that somebody here was a j. Crew model and i was referring to myself. How is that a bad rumor? Because a lot of people think that models, Even though they're very attractive are somewhat vapid. It set our industry back quite a bit. Michael, why? Why say all these things? Why make up an eating disorder, stanley's affair, Me being a spokesdog? You told everyone i was having an affair? Okay, okay, here's the thing. There was one true rumor out there today. I didn't want everybody to know what it was, So all of you are off the hook except for this one person. Well, then what's the one true rumor? We have a right to know. Michael, am i gay? The one true rumor-- And this is gonna ruin this person's life--Is that-- That pam's pregnant. - I knew it. - I knew it. - I knew it. Her breasts were a tiny bit bigger. At first i thought, oh, she has a new bra with padding. But then i thought, pam doesn't need padding. It just didn't add up, jim. Okay, thank you. - Congratulations. - That's really great, you guys. - Don't vaccinate it. - Who's the father? Jim. - How far along? - Four months. - Who's the ob-Gyn? - Stop. Don't say. All right. All right, you know this is not the truth And you can't fall on a sword this way. The real thing is that stanley hudson had an affair. - Nope. - Yes, jim. Thank you for trying to defend us, but actually, pam is pregnant and we can prove it - Yes. - If everybody would like to see proof. Want to--Okay. - Just gonna wait for her? - What's the "proof" mean? - Oh, my! There it is! - It's true! - Pam, look at that! That is the inside of your vagina. That's not how it works, but-- It's clear why we were trying not to tell people. That's clear now. Yeah. How long have you known about the pregnancy? A week? Month? A year? Michael, we only told our parents last week. Did you pee on a stick? I did. But it was inconclusive. You should have told me. You're right. We should have realized that you are an equal part of this. Yes? Michael, teri hudson returning your call. - You called stanley's wife? - Oh, oh, yeah. A long time ago. Just to make sure she was out of town. - Oh, god. - Don't take it. No, i have to take it or it'll seem suspicious. If you talk to her, you're gonna tell her about stanley and that's gonna seem more suspicious. No, no, no. I can do this. - You can't do this. - Yes, i can. I am going to tell her that i need to redecorate my condo and i need her help. We will haggle about money and i will back down And then i won't talk to her until this whole cynthia thing's blown over. - Michael, please don't. - Sounds terrible. Hey, what up, cynthia? Just hang on a second, cynthia. Well, it turns out that teri was already suspicious Because she had caught stanley and cynthia a few months ago. So stanley promised that he would stop and he did. End of story. Well, not exactly. Uh, cynthia kept calling him. She would not stop calling him and she was in love with him. Oh, and get this. Cynthia? Also married. So you can't stop love, i guess. And quite frankly, i don't think?? I learned that a company can describe an internship as full of exciting experiences, Even if that's a lie. There's no regulation. I learned that half these people's email password is "password." - I learned that a ream of paper is 300 sheets. - I thought it was 500. Oh. I guess i didn't learn anything. I learned that if you look even the tiniest bit like jet li, Michael will call you jet li all summer. - Julia stiles. - Alan thicke. Hola. Hola. Necesito UN buen worker. TÃº es fuerte. Come on. Â¿que? Â¿que? No vamos con ESE senor. Lo he visto saliendo con muchos otros, Y no vuelven nadie. We don't go with that man. I've seen several men go with that man and not come back. - He perdido amigos - We've lost friends No Se lo Que hace con ellos. We don't know what he does with them. No quiero decir mas. I don't wanna talk about it anymore. I pick up day laborers And tell them that they'll get paid at 6:00 P.M. At 5:45, a certain I.N.S. Agent By the name of Mose Schrute Throws them in the back of a van, Drops them off in the middle of Harrisburg, And tells them it's Canada. - Hola, amigo. - Hola. TÃº es UN bueno worker? Si. Yo muy bueno worker. Y el acento DÃ³nde are you from? Scranton. Y Before that, la Philadelphia. - You speak English? - Yes. I'm really good at English. Okay, good, me too. Get in the car. Okay. Who is this guy by our cars? That is my new maintenance worker Nate, And you'll be happy to know that he's taking care of That hornet's nest that you've been griping about. Yeah. I got stung up my dress. Poor hornet. I left him all the tools he needs. This is do or die. If he chooses correctly, he conquer the hornets. And if he doesn't? He'll die. - What? - Uh, beg your pardon? When did the phrase "do or die" become so corrupted? - Is that a blowtorch? - No. No, no, no! No, no! Interesting choice. OhYes. - Very, very smart. - Walking away. - No! No, no, no! - The bat. Oh, they're stinging him! - No, no, no! - No, no! Good morning, Erin. Any moustaches I mean messages? Terrific. There are many reasons A man would wear a fake moustache to work. He is a fan Of the outrageous. He loves to Surprise! He loves Other things as well. It's a pimple, Phyllis. Avril Lavigne gets them all the time, And she rocks harder than anyone alive. Uh, that's no pimple, Michael. You mean cancer? What? No way. No. Definitely not not cancer. It's just good to catch a Michael train of thought early Before it derails and destroys the entire town. Wait, wait, wait, wait. It's just a cold sore. It is? - Yep. Just a cold sore. - Just a cold sore. Thank you. Phyllis, I don't have acne. I have a cold sore. I didn't even have a cold. I don't know how I got it. I know how you got it. - How? - Michael, come on. A cold sore is herpes. - What? - What you should do, Michael, Is have a doctor take a look at it, 'cause we don't really know what that is. I know tons and tons of people who have herpes. I have it myself. That's what it is. I've never seen herpes on you. 'cause it's on my genitals, genius. You have a penis? Michael, have you ever been tested for STDs? Yeah. My last physical when I was 40. That was like ten years ago. No, it was like four years ago. Michael, you're at least 46. Why at least? If you're guessing 46, just say 46. Can please talk about how gross Meredith is? This is what you get When you treat your body like an outhouse. You know what, guys? How 'bout we just chill out a little bit on the herp chat? Okay? I was an r.A. In college, And I can tell you, The number one sexually transmitted disease Is ignorance. I guess maybe she could marry a meth dealer with crabs I don't even want to know about these things. Hey, guys. How did this happen? How did I get this? Sometimes it can lie dormant in a woman for years. They may not even ow that they have it. You ow what? I feel like One of those old-timey sailors with VD. Eh, it's me own darn fault. Girl in every port! But what port? The Jan port? The Holly port? Don't even Holly was clean, okay? If anything, I gave it to her. - You may have. - Oh, my God. What if I did? You need to contact Holly. You need to notify her that she is crawling with herpes. Okay. You know what? Might. Might be crawling with herpes. I might have gotten it after her. You need to contact every woman you've been with And notify them of your herpes infestation. It's the right thing to do. There's no way I'm gonna do that. - Then I will. - All right, I Now, I'm no doctor, but it seems to me That we all have an obligation to the public health To track down anyone who gives us a disease, Inform them of it, And take overwhelming revenge on that person. Again, I'm no doctor. I'm just a normal guy who enjoys revenge. Hello. Hi, Donna. It's Michael. Michael. I didn't think I'd hear from you. How've you been? I have a disease For which there is no known cure That has been sexually transmitted to me. Oh, no! I can't even say it. HI Oh, my God! RP E.E - W-wait. - S. You're calling to tell me that you have herpes? No. I am calling to see if you gave me herpes, Because if you did, I would be able to avoid a lot of sucky conversations. So you have it, right? No. Does your stupid husband have it? No, he doesn't. Are you telling me I have to get tested? Yes, I'm telling you you have to get tested for herpes. Good-bye! - So long, Donna. 'scuse me, everyone, can I have your attention, please? - Not again. - What do you mean, again? You're always asking for our attention. Well, maybe like a year ago. - Mm. Seems recent. - No, that's Andy, the reason it seems more recent Is because many of us here have never stood up And asked for everyone's attention, And it seems like you've done that on several occasions. Everyone, I've noticed that We've not been entirely kind to one of our own, Due to stigmas and prejudices. Oh, when you got your new phone That's when you asked for everyone's attention. World cup. That's what I was thinkin'. You kept announcing scores. It's the world's only international sport, so This is hoy. No, this is Holly. No This is Holly. No, this is Holly. NoThis is Michael Scott. Busted. So what can I do for you, Holly? I'm calling because There was a terrible car accident. Oh, really? Was anyone killed? A lot of people. - Any nuns? - Three nuns.

Anyone who's interested in entering into An hest discussion about the sexual mores and taboos Of modern society will be rewarded with a pizza break. Do you ever wonder what life would have been like If you hadn't been transferred? - Yeah. - We would have twins. I don't think we'd have kids. - Mm-hmm. - We dated for a few weeks. - Mm-hmm.

I don't romantici - N-no - Michael, you cried At that tag line for a movie you made up. He had no arms or legs. He couldn't see, hear, or speak. This is how he led a nation. You made us out to be more than we were. Maybe we were more than we were. I don't know what you're getting so upset about. We had a fun fling a long time ago. It's a good memory. Okay, all right. I gotta go. Michael he forgot to mention the herpes. It didn't come up organically. To accommodate the suppliers. Gentlemen, nice to see you it'll be just a moment. If you could show them into conference room "b." The pharmaceutical company Should be able to accommodate us. How do I do it? Raise my daughter Work as director of office purchasing for this hospital, And release an album of Doris day covers On my own label? If I knew, I'd tell you. It's nice to see you doin' so well. Yeah.

Now I'm gonna show you another picture Of perfectly normal genitalia. Oh, my God! Am I blocking anybody? Can everybody see? Perfectly normal. Big deal. Yeah, sure, it's got some herpes on it. But you know what? It's just as normal as anyone else's. No. In the beginning, we were not good. WellThere was a bit of a learning curve In the conversation department, But between the sheets, We were like Jordan and pippen. Well, if there's anything exciting about it, It was because we both knew it was wrong. - Because we worked together. - No. Okay, imagine there's a princess Who falls for a guy beneath her station, And the queen doesn't like this at all. And the princess knows that the queen doesn't like it, And so it makes her want to do it all the more Just to get at the queen. - Am I the princess? - No, I'm the princess. And the queen. Okay. So I'm the guy at the station. Mommy! Assy! Oh!  how was school?

You I used to think that she was the one. Or at least a "the one." And if I called that one so wrong Herpes, like all stds, is a consequence of sex. Can anyone else name any other consequences? It feels unbelievable. Okay, I guess we can make a pros column. Feels Unbelievable. Okay. The ability to express love physically. It's a magical thing. Express love. Magical. It feels amazing. Um, okay, is that different from feels unbelievable? - Yes. - Then I will write it down. The feeling of pure risk. Creed, I had that in the cons column, But It's thrilling. Okay. Um, then We'll move that. "thrill of risk." Andy, aren't there also negatives to sex? Yes! Thank you. Such as Unplanned pregnancy. Yes. Unplanned pregnancy. - Like Jim and pam what? - Hey. Just admit that your baby was a mistake. Hey, hey, hey. Our baby was not a mistake. She was a surprise. Good. I'm sure they don't regret having that child. Let's move it to the pros. Thank you. Okay. Unplanned pregnancy. Going in the pros column. Next up is helene. You're gonna want to make a left on willow, Which is a little ways away. Uh, I'll remind you. You know, I don't know if I trust jan's judgment. She Jan knows paper. No, not paper. Relationships. To have the ability to point out If a man is making a bigger deal out of something Than is really there. Wait, what Holly said? - Yes! I don't - forget it, Michael. Today is about herpes. I know. Okay? Who gave it to you, who has it - Right. - And who is going to pay. - Okay. - To answer your question About jan no, jan is insane. Why do you think I Left! Willow now! All right! God! Hi, stranger. Long time. Who are you? I'm Michael. We dated for a while. I don't think so. Michael? Oh, hey! Dwight, would you take my grandmother for a walk While I talk to the real helene? - Come on, old lady, let's go. - What is happening? Shh, shh, shh, shh. Come on. Who can tell me the safest form of safe sex? - Condoms. - Incorrect. The only true form of safe sex Okay? Abstinence. Oh! I didn't realize we were doing Trick questions. What's the safest way to go skiing? Don't ski. I just thought I'd bring it up In case someone here was practicing abstinence. That's all. Anybody? Andy, that's way too personal of a question. Well, someone could answer it if they wanted to. Okay, in that case, I will now show you how to put this condom on using This pencil. oh, God! What? Why choose a pencil, Andy? Well, I'm not gonna use my penis, Oscar. It's not exactly hard right now anyway. Come on, give it a rest, pencil Dick! I'm doing this for you, Meredith! - I didn't want it! - Well, did you WhyDidn't Does no one appreciate what I'm doing right now? Whoa! It'll go away in time. Just don't touch it. Did I make more of what we had Than was really there? What did you think we were? Just a Quirky indie movie Weird sorta thing Breakin' all the rules But had to end Because the summer was over. For you. - I-I think that for you to have come here Even expecting That we could have a conversation like this Shows how how self-deluded you are. Michael, yourMemory has failed you greatly. Jerk. Michael So this is a chef's kitchen, Which makes it perfect for real entertainers. Real entertainer, like Billy Joel. - Michael. - Carole. How are you? I'm great. How are you? I'm great. I saw your sign outside, And I decided, I'm gonna pull in, And maybe I'm going to buy a house from her. Oh. You didn't call my office And ask them where I was? No! that's so 'cause the receptionist told me that a man called, But he would only say that he was my ex-lover. - Weird. - Yeah. Sounds like a nice guy. I don't know, I mean, people were being really mean to Meredith But this wasn't really about Meredith, was it? You and Erin were broken up How is that relevant to anything? I asked you if it was okay if I asked her out. You said and I quote "my good sir, nothing would make me happier Than to hand you the hand of the hand once in my hand." I specifically remembered it Because you said it in such a weird way. Well, the only reason I said that Is 'cause you asked me so politely And it was very difficult for me to say no. I'll let this slide. But I expect you to put this whole Erin thing behind you. Oh, wow. Another living room. It's a family room. You put the tv there. You put your family here. Michael, why are you here? Somebody told me That I romanticize relationships. You know, we all do that. I have herpes. What? Did you have that while we were together? I just found out today. It's It's right there. Oh. Oh. What, that's what you're talking about? - Mm-hmm. I'm sorry. Did you have a doctor check it out? I'm between specialists right now. Yes. Yes, Michael. Actually, you do make a bigger deal out of things Than you need to. You proposed to me on our fourth date. Well, I believe in love at first sight. Well, so do I, But we didn't love each other at first either. I don't know what you were thinking. I know what I was thinking at the time, But right now, it just seems ridiculous. Excuse me. Someone died in the upstairs bathroom, didn't they? No. We should Schedule meetings, 'cause the days can slip away with chitchat. Are you crying? No. I'm just sweating. I don't know what's got you upset, But my advice is Stop crying. I'm not crying. I'm sweating. Look, you need to pick yourself up. Man up, all right? Son, you will win this in the end. It's all about heart And character. Be your best self. Okay. Yeah. I have no idea what his problem is. It's just my standard advice. It's good advice, right? This is Holly flax. I can't come to the phone right now, But please leave a message At the sound of the tiny truck backing up. Hi, Holly, it's Michael. I just wanted to call and let you know That I was thinking about what you said. It's justYou know It's weird. Today I Ended up seeing a lot of the women that ud to date, And iny mind, ey were all great. And then when I actually saw them, It was mostly a freak show. And you and me, That must have been a real Train wreck. You know what? Holly, you're wrong. You are wrong. I remember every second of us. And talking to you today I don't feel for them anything like what I feel for you. It's I didn't joke with any of them. I joked with you. You were the only one Who was actually happy to hear from me. And I don't know why you downgraded what we had, But I did not make us up. Okay. Oh, and you might you should talk to a doctor Because you might have herpes. Bye. - What is this about? - Oscar We once sucked face in public As parof an office presentation Destroy the stigma about gay kissing. Do you recall? Yes, and You may have given me a sexually transmitted disease. - What? - Herpes duplex. ****** I already contacted all of my ex-lovers except for you. - We were never lovers. - I'm gonna need a list of every men you've ever had sex with. - I'm talking train stations, *** - *** - ***** - **** - ***** - ***** Oscar, think about Think. Hey, so this isn't matching up with this. So I'm not sure which one is right. Can you just hand down the original for me. - Yes, me do. - All right. Hey, what were you saying before about the paperwork? Me doing now! Go. Stop worry. Kevin, do you feel okay? Me feel good. Body strong. Sleep big last night. Yeah, I think we should get him to the hospital. Yeah, all right, Kevin. Why don't you come with us? - No, no, guys. - No, he's fine. - He's always been like that. - No, he hasn't. I mean, he's gotten worse over the years, but He's making a statement. It's an ironic comment on our expectations of him. A funhouse image of our model of Kevin. You keep think that. Me mechanic not speak English. But he know what me mean when me say, "car no go," and we best friends. So me think, why waste time say lot word when few word do trick? Kevin, I appreciate what you're trying to do. Thank. Here, we have a word code. The same way we have a dress code. And what we're talking about is basically the speech equivalent to just wearing underpants. Sometimes, words you no need use but need-need for talk-talk. But save time. More success. Does it save time, though? 'Cause we've been here for about an hour. No me fault. Kevin At most, you're saving a microscopic amount of time. Many small time make big time. And what are you gonna do with all this time? See world. Kevin, you can't possibly save enough time to see the world. Kevin, are you saying, "see the world" or "seaworld"? See world. Oceans, fish, jump. China. No, see? Right there, that's the problem with your method. 'Cause I still don't know if you're saying seaworld or see the world, and it's taking a lot of time to explain it. Fine. Fine. I'll talk normally. When me president, they see. They see. This week, we are rolling out the brand-new sabre tablet The pyramid. Ooh, why is it shaped like that? So you can tell your clients, "unleash the power of the pyramid." It's huge. How much does it weigh? Oh, no, no, no. Without the battery pack and the optional memory booster, it's barely three pounds. How much memory does it have without the booster? - I'm sorry, "L"? - Mm-hmm. How many "L" to a "K"? You're really gonna want the booster. How on Earth are we supposed to sell-- I'll take five. Andy, don't make us sell this stupid thing. Oh, no, no, no, no. This is Dwight's meeting. - Thank you, the-- - I just wanted to pop in and get your opinions on ties and tie clips. Which combo do you think Robert's gonna like more? What do you think, c-span? C-span? Yeah C-span. Cocker spaniel. Spaniel 'cause of your Spanish bloodline, cocker 'cause Is this really the best use of our collective time? I am still forming a first impression with Robert. Once it is formed, we can all relax, okay? I'm sorry to hijack your meeting, d-dub-dog. Had to pull rank. Okay. Let's look at some ties. Here's how I'm gonna help out from now on. I'm going to not care. And I'm gonna sit around quietly waiting for Andy's inevitable demise. Your friend Neil Patrick Harris really made me laugh the other night. Um, D-dog, you have a message. Erin, you don't need to call him that. Andy wants us to, P-dog. It's okay, E-dog. Just who called? Justine. She said she's coming by later. Your ex-wife? Wait, I thought she was a [Bleep] And you [Bleep] hated her guts. - Kevin - Oh, my God. No, no, no, no. I like her. Well, I'm just quoting you. I would never say that about her. I don't know the woman. No, man. We get along now. Real well. Wow. All right. Can't wait to meet her. I'll introduce you. Yeah, we had a few fights, I suppose. But last night, we put a lot of that to bed. I can't tell you what I did with my ex-wife last night. I have to sing it.  We took a shower   we were naked   we   scap dap dap doo doo doo doo doo doo doo  Hi, dad. Ah--ohh. Oh, boy. Hello, Andy. Excellent tie. Would you be requiring a cold beverage while you're here? I'd love some coffee. I was looking over your projections, and I think we can to better. Are you factoring in the whole national economy Declining and all that? Andy, do you know why I chose you? I think I can sum up with what I think is your favorite ice cream flavor. Vanilla. Valla? No, no. You'll never guess in a million, billion years, you'll never guess. You were saying you chose me. There was a reason. Andy, can you inspire? Do you have that skill set? Can I inspire? I don't know! I don't know. Oh, thank you. - Oh, uh-- - Oh, sorry. Here, just put it down. Oh. Mm. Ah. That is very cold. Yeah, it's old. Why would I-- I asked if you wanted a cold beverage, and you said coffee. Why don't we get Robert a nice, hot, fresh cup, and I will have this. Andy, you don't want that. I've been craving a freezing cup of old coffee. Mmm. Sorry. You like her. I-I do. Yeah. She likes you. You know, we've both been into each other at different times, and just never really synced up. Now we're in this weird dance-- I'm afraid you've lost my interest. Let me call you back. I gotta go. If the office superstore was supposed to put us little suppliers out of business, why are we still here? Yeah. This is where we go. You'd go someplace else. That's not it. That's not the answer. - It's a answer. - It's a wrong answer. - There are no wrong answers. - Take a look at where you are. Where you once worked in a dying industry, you now work at its birth. The superstores are terrified of us. Anybody know why? WaitThey're terrified? Let me tell you how I buy something these days. I know what I want, I go on the Internet and get the best price. Or I don't know what I want, and I go to a small store that can help me. The era of personal service is back. You are back. You'll find that customers will pay our higher prices and then they will thank us, and we will say to them, "you are welcome." Ah, thank you. Ooh! Andrew, I chose you for a reason. Lead these people. Show me the best numbers this place has ever seen. Last quarter we saw 4% growth. Double it. You got it. - Double. - Done. - I'm not kidding. - Neither am I. It's already done. Ha. I'm just kidding. - It's gonna take some time. - Double. Hey. Hey What's up, guys? Just thought we'd have a little rap session, talk about business, see how things are going. Well, you start. If no one else wants to. I was just thinking about Robert. Man, what a boss. JustThrows down goals, you know? Anyway, how's the sales doubling project going? How are we supposed to do that? We can't just press a magic button. Of course not. There's no magic button. You have to Summon that. If we could just double our sales, we already would have. You're not making sense. He brings up two good points. Do you have any new leads, any new territories you want us to look into, maybe have an in with a big client that we could get our foot in the door? Dwight, anything? We could talk about how fast children grow up. And before you know it, they're out of the house. You know what? We need to get our heads out of the box. If we did have something, what would it look like? What would it be? Tuna. New leads, a new territory to look into, maybe an in with a big company that we could get our foot in the door. Fart. Good sesh. That leg's asleep. Hello. I'm looking for a Darryl Philbin. Don't-- Oh You must think-- I'm not. I'm using the fax. This isn't-- No, wait. I'm not supposed to represent the company, right? There's usually an Erin here. - Okay. - So Darryl! A girl!  Rub a dub dub   with the apricot scrub  What's up, darling? Hey, everybody, this is justine. - Hello. - Hi, justine. - Hi. - This is Jim and Oscar. Hi. Everybody. Hello. Kevin. Can we go someplace private? Follow me. I got a space. After you. I been thinking about you all morning. I don't know what you did. I can barely walk today. D-bone. There you are. Let me guess. Somebody needs a brownie! Lick the spoon? No, that's okay. I just-- I wanted to ask you about Is this about the profits? Because if it is, I just don't see the point. It's so wall street. - I know, right? - Right? - Yeah. - Ha. Um How is everything? Good. Really, really good. Must be a tough time to be a family farm. Oh, it is. And beets are not immune. We made some inroads in salad, but heirloom tomatoes are pushing back. Oof. What are you gonna do about that? I don't know. What do you mean? Gotta be some way you could double your beet sales. You wanted the job. The job is yours. Just do the job. And I'llDo mine. Walnuts? No! Have you seen this? Parenting? Yeah. This is Cece's favorite magazine. She loves the pictures of babies. She looks at it when she's on the potty, and she makes the faces-- - Have you read it? Has an adult member of your family read this particular issue? I flipped through it. So you saw the article on the importance of taking frequent walks while you're pregnant. - Of course, yeah. - Everyone knows that. I will be taking a morning walk and an afternoon walk. Would you like to join me? That sounds nice. Great. You have a walking buddy. I do! - Thanks for coming in, guys. - You don't have to thank us for coming in-- It's our job. Well, I never got thanked for coming into a meeting, and I always wanted to be, so I'm gonna thank people. What's under the blanket? This is what's under the blanket. WeDon't get it. These are incentives. It's how we're gonna double growth. Now, you're probably all asking yourselves, "well, how does this work?" Seems like a basic reward system where you give us points and then we redeem those points for prizes. You're exactly right, and you get a point. - Oh! - Is that a vibrator? - 20 points. - How does one get a point? I've outlined the exact parameters in an email, so check your spam folders. But basically You do your job better, you get points. So Collect 15 points, and redeem them for this polar bear. Why is it all kids' stuff and a vibrator? It's so gross. There's lots of stuff. John Irving, collected works. Or you can pool your points and redeem 55 for this maternity shirt. How about you want us to work harder, pay us more? I can't. This point system is really insulting. Ooh. Well, I didn't mean to offend you, and I hope you'll forgive me, because I'm very, very Sari. It's a tablecloth. What if went all the way up to 500 points? That's a crazy amount of points. - But what if? - Well, what do you want? I don't know. For such a crazy number, I'd like something pretty crazy. All right. For 500 points, I will wear a dress to work. Ah! That's pretty good. What about, uh, for I'll run naked through the parking lot with a doughnut on my dingdong. Yeah? You like that? All right, for 5,000 points, I willLet you tattoo whatever you want on the stern of the old SS Bernard. - Oh! - Here we go! All right, all right, and you are totally serious. Swear to God, hope to die. Now, let's get to work! Wait. But you did say we could pool our points, right? In that case, let's get to work. - Yeah! - Yeah! - Yeah! - Whoo! All right, thank you very much. Uh, Phyllis, brachen auto? Ask for Donald. Karen's bananas. I just want you to benefit from our T-bag-bone. Andrew. Have you noticed just a little bit of a mood shift around here? No, I haven't noticed anything. Really? Because I sat next to Stanley for years, and this is naptime. - Yeah? - Open-eye naptime. He balances the phone on his shoulder and just powers down. Now look at him. You've got to unleash the power of the pyramid. I don't know what to tell you, man. You think it has something to do with that incentive program? Oh, 100%. We all want to see you tattoo your ass. Uh I think people thought I was kidding when I said that. No, you definitely weren't kidding. That came across loud and clear. Oh, by the way, wanna hand this in? Yeah, big sale. Don't worry about it, though. I don't really care about the points. I would like a point receipt, though. Hey, yes, this is Jim Halpert calling for Donald. Can you hold on for one second? Thank you very much. Who talked to Maggie at Kaufman's? Erin. Yes, Mrs. Guffner? Right. And I'm back. How are you, sir? Erin can squeeze a couple more golf games in, right? No, I'm not getting out there anytime soon. Hey, Kevin. What are you doing? Don't talk to me! Hi, Professor Frank. Andy Bernard, class of '95. Hey, there. Um, I'm a huge fan of your management book, management. Um, quick question. I may be missing a chapter here. De-incentivizing? What are your strategies? Looking for a real blow to morale. Uh, why? Well, um, I guess you could say I'm in one of those classic ass-tattoo incentive situations. Yes! Took 'em one day. Are you ready? "I'm not as think as you drunk I am." I like it. I like it. "Do not resuscitate." Okay, let's keep in mind, it's not too late to choose another prize. And there are some great new additions. My car-- For 1,000 points. Or best offer. What else you got? Oh, and then this was Phyllis's idea. - Oh, my God! - So nasty, Phyllis. We were hoping you could do something like this. So coming out of his butt is a-- - Baby. - Baby. Yes. Yeah, no problem. You should think about this. Anyone have any better ideas? I like what we have. - Yeah, nice try. - Yeah. For sure what we have. - It's funny. - It's apropos. Just need a second outside. - You getting psyched up? - Yeah. Andy, nobody really expects you to go through with this. Tunes What am I doing here? Why did Robert pick me? Confession, I don't know what I'm doing. I mean, do you like it? You having fun? Tell you this, everybody else is having a lot of fun. And you did that. But my ass is only so big. I mean, I can't do this every day. But I think it's big enough to buy you some time till your next great idea. Which, by the way, I can't wait for. No one expects me to go through with this, right? Absolutely not. Let's ink my stink! - Andy! - Yeah! My heart belongs to music. But my ass belongs to these people. Whoa! Good stuff. Do your worst. Uh, you can keep your pants on, actually. If you just drop 'em down a bit, that'd be great. They're already off, my good sir. I'd really prefer they not be down. Well, I think down's better. Sweating pretty heavily down there. Do you think you could work from this? We made some small adjustments. - Okay, you want me to-- - Just these few adjustments. Yeah. All right, let's begin. This is where I grin and-- Ow! Ow! That was just a cotton swab. Invest in softer cotton, sir. Whew. Oh, boy. Oww! Ohhh! Ho, ho! Ohhh! Whoa! Obviously, you can go the ass tattoo route. And obviously, I'm gonna like it. Draw some blood! Ha! Ahhhhh-haaaaa! Great tattoo. Why did I choose Andy to run the office? Because he's all surface, uncomplicated. What you see is what you get. Could be a recipe for mediocrity, yes, but then again, it might just be why people fight for him. It's a nard dog. That's my nickety-name. - Yeah! - Woo-hoo! I love it. I love it. Pull up your pants. There's something about an underdog that really inspires the unexceptional. Um, what should we talk about? Well, we could talk about an ethical dilemma I'm having. Oh, yeah, sure. Um, I hope I can help. A coworker of mine is drinking caffeine while pregnant, and I don't know if I should call social services about it. Angela, that's pretty transparently me. Maybe. You know, it's just herbal tea. In mugs with trace amounts of coffee. Yeah, I think you should call social services. I already did. You know, maybe we should just have our own pregnancy as in not pretend like we are in this together. - Fine. - Fine. Hold it! New glasses. Dwight, what a ridiculous, fancy clown you are. I am dressed according to the Schrute codes of mourning. My aunt Shirley has died. Oh, Dwight, I'm so sorry. Were you guys close? I would say that she raised me, but let's not kid each other. I raised myself. She was, however, the closest thing I had to a mother. My actual mother was very cold and distant. I'd say she was the closest thing I had to an aunt. - My condolences. - Keep them! Okay. Now, what do we got in these two pails? In keeping with Schrute custom, I will either invite you to Saturday's funeral by sprinkling red, fertile dirt in your face, or I will ask you to keep a respectful distance during my time of grief, with a dusting of black, slightly acidic soil. What color is it? It looks pretty black. Yep. Acidic all right. Oh, thank God. Excuse me? Oh, I'm so sorry, Dwight. And if you want me to be there, of course I will go. It's just I have a personal training session. Okay, that's not-- - I get red dirt. Nobody is getting red dirt. I should've kept my mouth shut. We're not even that close. I've only known Dwight Time is a son of a bitch. I'm sure-- I'm sure she's in a better place. I really hope so. Okay, now this is crazy. You can't make a dirtball-- - I miss her so much. - Okay. You know? Aah!  There's a bright golden haze   on the meadow   a bright golden haze on the meadow  - Ziek's here. - Ziek! Hey, Dwight. Mose, mom says hi. Hi to mom. You going? Will there be ghosts there? - Get in the sidecar. - Get in the sidecar. Get in the sidecar. - You get in the sidecar. - Get-- What are you doing here? You invited me. You threw the red dirt in my face. Oh, yeah. Who is that? Jeb, my brother. - You have a brother? - Mm-hmm. I didn't really see a better parking spot. Oh! Look what I did. It's a rental. - You wanna go in? - No, you do! You wanna go in? You wanna go in? - I'll put you in there. - Okay, I'll put you-- - Here we go. - Oh! Oh, no! Oh, no! Uncle! Uncle! Uncle! Uncle! Uncle! Oh! - Oh, gosh. - Hey, moonface. Nice to see those shiny little Chinese eyes of yours. Who's this guy? - Bad. - Hi, all! Why are you here, Todd? Okay, let's get right to it, I guess. My name is Todd Packer, and I am in recovery. I'm working the steps. I'm on step eight of Alcoholics Anonymous, step nine of Narcotics Anonymous. I'm here to make amends. I've been hard to deal with over the past years. Kind of a jerk. I know it. I don't need you to accept my apology, but I'd love it if you did. Packer, we accept. Actually, they have a specific way I need to do this, and I have to go through examples of stuff. Okay, uh, where to begin? Hey Pam-Pam and her pam-pams. Well, I have said some crude things about those. But they are beautiful, and I guess that's why I acted out. Pam, I'm sorry I objectified you and personified your breasts. Sorry, guys. Oh, boy. I have not been nice to you. Phylly, I'm sorry for the things I said about your size to your face, behind your back, and in the form of drawings. Actually, that goes to all you double XLs. Stanley, Kevin this kid in a few years. Todd, you're just saying insults in the form of an apology. Why can't I just be nice? Truth is I really like you guys. I really do. Okay, the apology's just half of it. The big thing is making amends, and that's why I brought these. I went out to the Steamtown mall, and I got you all cupcakes from that place Nipples. Think it's called Nibbles. Ha. The mind sees what it wants to, huh? Ohh there you go. Hey, hey, guys. Wait. Before we accept these cupcakes, I think we need to have a conversation privately in the conference room. Don't eat the cupcake. We are here today to join this woman on the ground. Man is born of woman, and his life is full of turmoil. It's crap soil. Nothing's gonna grow here. It doesn't matter. It's a cemetery. Yeah, well, I'm saying it's garbage soil, that's all. Well, the only thing we're planting here is dead bodies. That's fine, 'cause they're not gonna grow. Well, thank God they're not, because we don't wanna make zombies. Good. I agree. Don't worry about it. You won't get any. Would the family care to say something? You had black hair and then gray hair. You were the aunt to my cousins. Most of your life, you were 5'4". At the end, you were 5'1". They're a descriptive people. I see you started without me. You were late, so what am I supposed to do? - Hi, Fanny. - Hey. - How are you? - Who is that? - Dwight's sister. - Dwight has a sister? Yeah. She's beautiful. Blech. Hello, little man. Haven't seen you in a few years. Wha-- what is this-- oh, God. What'd he-- - Henry. - Dwight. I see Esther's back in town. Hi, Dwight. Hi, Esther. Nice of you to come today. This was on the way. We're going into town after. I need yarn. Well, if you can snap two chicken necks with a single motion, why use two motions to slaughter those chickens? We're at a funeral. There's a funeral going on here. - Okay. - Okay. - Anyone mention her height? - Yep. Land size? Shirley, at 1,600 acres, you have the largest farm in the area, sharing borders with six other farms including my own farm and your nephew Dwight's. Okay. So let's get it going. Would you want to do the honors? Oh, right, uh you know, I-I don't think we have to do this. We Schrutes don't need some Harvard doctor to tell us who's alive and who's dead. But there was an unlucky streak of burying some heavy sleepers. And when grave robbers discovered some scratch marks on the inside of some of the coffins, we decided to make sure that our dead were completely dead out of kindness. That's it for me. I don't think we should eat Packer's cupcakes. We can't give him the satisfaction. I agree. Even though that place has a way of making those cupcakes so they're dense but they're also really fluffy. We can't let him buy our forgiveness with cupcakes. He was awful to us. And he still is. How much is a cupcake, Is that the price of our dignity? I never forget a number. Names, in one ear and out the other. Places, nope. Faces, that's rich. But numbers I have a gift. I guess that's why I'm an accountant. Hey, man, I don't think we've met. - I'm Clark. - Oh, I'm Todd. Oh, sorry for calling you a fat little runt earlier. You didn't actually say that. - No? - No. Wow! I'm in this mode now where I'm apologizing for thoughts that are in my head. Hmm. Hey! I have a crazy feeling that you are really gonna like this. Maybe we should eat the cupcakes. Haven't we done enough to Packer? I mean, we sent him down to Florida on a prank, and you did fire him. I did. I did, yes. And it was purely political. He did nothing wrong. Would any of you be saying any of this if the cupcakes were from Supermart? Do they even have a bakery anymore? They do. It's awful! And it's getting worse every day. So it really is just about the cupcakes. Wow, you're right. It is just about the cupcakes. So we're all agreed no one touches those cupcakes? - Okay. - Okay. Packer can go to hell. Thank you for coming to my funeral. As I gaze at life's big sunset, I can't help but wonder where it all went wrong. You've all disappointed me greatly. Fanny, a single mama in the city. Thank you. Jeb, a street pusher. After I left the army, I bought a nine-acre worm farm from a Californian. Turns out, "worm" means something else out there, and I am now in the business of pain management. Or the smoking of pain management. I can't stand the fact that Jeb is a pot farmer. He could've grown anything. Anything in the world. He used to talk about growing a peanut-grape hybrid. One plant, one sandwich. We can't just sit by and watch our family farm disappear. So here are my terms. Dwight, Fanny, Jeb. If you come back home, I will leave you my farm. - So there you have it. - Is she crazy? - Dwight? - Dwight? Buddy? - No, no, no. - Snap out of it. Dwight! Let's do this. Let's run Aunt Shirley's farm. I'm in. Boom! No, no, no. I'm not moving back here. - Are you crazy? - Of course you are. Look, I don't wanna be mean or, like, insulting. I know that you like it here. But, Dwight, it's just that farm life lacks a certain - sort of sophistication - Oh, my God. That Cami and I are drawn to. and I don't know, the men are just-- It's almost like there's a-- a willing ignorance. Yes, I-- thank you for asking me. I actually have written a little bit of poetry. That's crazy. And I was recently published. Which is just-- maybe I have-- yep, I do. Here it is from the, um hartfordwomenslitquarterly.com. A Willing Ignorance by Fanny Schrute. Totally. Yep. The people here are like like a fart. You know what I'm saying? Like a fart. You know what? Let's take a couple of nights and stay here and think about Aunt Shirley's offer. Couple of nights couldn't hurt. Oh, somehow I think a couple of nights could hurt. You will say yes on one. Get ready to say yes. One! - Yes! - Absolutely! Growing up with Dwight and Mose was not easy. Uh, Dwight was obviously the cool one, and Mose was the visionary, which left me to be the comedian. - That doesn't work on me - Okay. By the way. It's not-- Quatre, trois, deux, un. Oui on un. Oui, un! - Very clever. - Oui! - Okay. - Oui, mais oui. Oui, oui, oui. - Oui. - Oh, my goodness.  When we arrive, sons and daughters   we'll make our homes on the water   we'll build our--  People underestimate the power of nostalgia. If baseball can use it to get people to care about that worthless sport, then I can use it to get my siblings to care about the farm. Nostalgia is truly one of the great human weaknesses. Second only to the neck.  When we arrive, sons and daughters   we'll make our homes on the water   we'll build our walls aluminum   we'll fill our mouths with cinnamon   now  So I forgot about this old custom. If a man is interested in courting a woman, he may throw the beaks of a crow at her. And then if she's interested in accepting the courtship, she has to destroy the beaks.  When we arrive, sons and daughters   we'll make our homes on the water   we'll build our walls aluminum   we'll fill our mouths with cinnamon  Hey, uh, I just wanna say I'm sorry for screwing you. I'm not sorry about it. I am. It was my rock bottom. - Kevin, you can do this. - You don't know that. Kevin, um, let's think of something to distract us. Like the movie Skyfall. You loved the movie Skyfall, right? Mm-hmm. James Bond was a spy. - Yes, he was a good spy. - Yeah. He was the best. James Bond would love this cupcake. Hey, you know what, it was great to see you all again. Take care. I am going through a 12-step program. I'm currently on step zero which is have a shitload of fun. I spent six hours carefully removing the frosting and then layering in a variety of drugs, some legal, some not some laxative, some constipating. You don't fire The Packman and expect to get away with it. Guys, I'm proud of us. I think we did the right thing. Hey! - What, Pam? - Wait! He's gone. It's just a cupcake now. No, no! It's the principle of the thing. Oh, my God. I forgive him so much. - Whoa! Is he choking? - Kevin? Oh, that was fantastic. Is it dangerous to take the eggs in front of them? Yes, very. You really need to stand back. 'Cause these are killer chickens. I was just asking you something I didn't know. Which is fine, and you learned something. But it was kind of a stupid question, so you're gonna get made fun of a little bit. Are we gonna eat these today? If you want. Is that a guillotine? This? No. That'd be cool though. It's for milking. That's a cow? Did you just ask me if this was a cow? What are you doing now? Come here. Come on. Grab a teat with each hand. Sit down. There you go. Squeeze from top to bottom. Really pull, use some muscle. Draw the milk out. All right, going all right? I don't know. Well, is the udder hot? Is the milk clumpy? - I don't know any of that. - Okay, you suck at this. Gimme those teats. Didn't your father teach you anything? I never met him. Good morning, Erin. Hey. Hey, everybody. Um, I decided to eat my cupcake. I thought about it last night. I talked to Jim, I talked to my sister, and I think that as long as Todd Packer doesn't know, it's okay. I don't care what you do, Pam, just please stop making noise. Phyllis! Packer laced the cupcakes. No! Did you get diarrhea or were you stoned? - Some of us got both. - Oh, my God! Is everyone okay? Last night, I got out all of my old dolls and played with them on the living room floor. Then I ordered ten American Girl outfits on line. It was thousands of dollars. Well, count yourself lucky, Phyllis. I got the toilet. Me too. I went Christmas caroling in March, and I fertilized some bushes along the way. So not my best night. But not my worst night. What did you do, Andy? Last night! Oh, God, um I don't know. Noth-nothing, really. - Kevin? - Why would you ask me? No, I'm not a-- I just-- I don't know. Oh gosh, I actually-- it is hard to recall. Um, pretty normal night. My night was just like that - Yup. - Okay. Meaning normal. Yeah, I didn't see you last night at all. Nope, I did not see you either. Wow! He is officially the worst human being. Ah! But Kevin, that's-- Yeah, no, I understand, Pam. I understand. No. Ohh. So that's it. I just wanted to make amends. - Wow. - That's big of you, man. Takes a lot of courage. Ooh. Red velvet. I should apologize too. It's okay. I'm over it.  When we arrive, sons and daughters  Ooh, this is no nine-acre worm farm. This is a beast. Whoever's managing this thing is gonna have a hell of a job. Mm-hmm. - Not it. - Not it. It. If your kid doesn't put in some farm time, or he's gonna stay like that. All right, fine.
