Okay. Well I did not get the job in New-York. But I got the real prize domestic bliss. Jan made me breakfast this morning. Well, she bought the milk. It's soy. This is why I do it. That's what I have to come home to. She probably won't be up for a few hours. This is going be a very good year. Very good. Jan is at home. Jim is back. My protégé Ryan is at corporate. Good stuff. Andy and Dwight are rocking the sales team. I feel very blessed. Generally it's not a good idea to click on any internet offers that you haven't requested. What was the exact offer? It was for a video. Yeah, well, what kind of video? A cebrity sex tape. Really? What kind of celebrity? - Not relevant. - How much you paid for it? - You paid for it? - It all happened so fast! I broke up with Karen after the job interview. And, uh It was a little awkward when she came back from the city. She told me very clearly that just because we were broken up doesn't mean that she was going anywhere, because she had worked really hard for her career. But the next day, her desk was empty. And as for me and my current romantic life I, uh I'm single now and looking. So if you know anybody Jim and I went to dinner a few times when he got back from New York. I talked him through his breakup. It's really nice to be good friends again. Are you kidding me? Pam and Jim are totally hooking up. All they do is smile. They're just keeping it a secret. Right? I don't know. There is no evidence of intimacy. They've been in remarkably good moods. Could other things. Are you kidding me? And sunday, I'm thinking of going to that flea market at the drive-in. Oh, that sounds fun. I'm mountain biking on sunday in montage mountain. - Cool. - Yeah. Well, have fun with that. Ladies and gentlemen. I have some bad news. Meredith was hit by a car. - What? - Where? It happened this morning in the parking lot. I took her to the hospital. And the doctors tried to save her life. They did the best that they could. And she is going to be okay. What is wrong with you? Why did you have to phrase it like that? - So she's really going to be fine? - Yes. She has a slight pelvical fracture. But people have survived far worse. Thank God you were there. Yeah. Did you see who did it? No need. We can just check the security tapes. Yeah, kind of a good news/bad news there. I was able to be on the scene so quickly because I was in the car that hit her. Who was driving? Oh, Michael. One day Michael came in complaining about a speed bump on the highway. I wonder who he ran over then. - It's only Meredith. - Yeah, it's only Meredith. Thank God. But did you see the way they looked at me? Like I was a murderer or something. - Why did you it? - It was an accident. - Was she talking back? - No. Just got sick of that face? Did she owe you money? Is this downsizing? Did she spurn your advances? Hey, guys. We're all gonna visit Meredith at lunch. And we're kicking in $5 for flowers. Who's we? You and Jim? No, me and Stanley and Phyllis so far. I bet Jim goes too. I haven't asked him yet. - I bet you ask. - I was planning on it. I bet you were. Angela? Are you coming? I can't. Sprinkles is sick. She's been sick for some time. Thank you for asking. No one asks about Sprinkles. I have to give her her meds, I have to pet her. And who will she eat lunch with? Can't your other cats keep her company? There's bad blood. Jealousies, cliques. Angela, you're the chairman of the party planning committee. I shouldn't even be planning this. It's your job. All right! - My lord, my lieg. - Yes, Michael? So Ryan got promoted to corporate where he is a little fish in a big pond. Whereas back here in Scranton, I'm still top dog in a fairly large pond. So whos the real boss? The dog or a fish? So I need a little treat for the gang. Something to win their affections back. Back? Why is that, Michael? Well, I ran down Meredith in my car. - Did you do this on purpose? - No, I was being negligent. But she's in the hospital, she's fine, recovering nicely. Tiny little crack in her pelvis. - But she will - It happened on company property? Yes. It was on company property with company property, so Double jeopardy, we are fine. I don't think you understand how jeopardy works.  Oh, right, I'm sorry. What is "we're fine"? People keep calling me a "wunderkind. " I don't even know what that means. I mean, I know what it means. It means very successful for your age. So I guess it makes sense, but It's a weird word. - Hey, D. - Hey monkey, what's up? Can you do me a favor? Go to my place and give Sprinkles her medicine? Sure. I have to visit the alkie. Check to see if she's faking. If a car hit me, it wouldn't crack my pelvis. You know what? I bet she cracked it at home. Jumped in front of the car to get some worker's comp. I wouldn't put it past her. - So what do you need me to do? - I wrote it out. There's a diabetes shot. Roll the insulin in your hands, don't shake it. She gets an ace inhibitor with her meal. But put her right in front of the dish, or her cataracts won't let her see it. Mix one capsule of omega fatty acid in with her kidney medicine. And you wanna give that to her And there's a fungal cream, because she has this infection under her tail. So you're gonna have to lift her tail and put the cream right at the base. Okay, I have an announcement. You pushed Darryl out the window? - You shot Dwight? - No. No, that is not funny. I love my employees. Even though I hit one of you with my car. For which I take full responsibility. Look, I'm just trying to take everybody's mind off of this unavoidable tragedy and on to more positive things. So I thought we should plant a tree. Oh, good. That means we don't have to work. We're leaving for the hospital at 1:00. So, like, a freedom tree. - I can take 3 people. - I can also take 3 people. - Separate cars. - Pam? We'll get a card at the hospital, and we'll sign it outside her room. Sales people can go later in the day. Hourly workers can go at lunch. Okay, good, good. So we'll just all go down there together at lunch. - Excellent. - I was thin - Good work, Pam. - But if you All right, since im the boss, I will drive as well. Who wants shotgun? You can't be serious. You ran a woman over this morning. Everybody inside the car was fine, Stanley! Guess what? I have flaws. What are they? Oh, I don't know. I sing in the shower. Sometimes, I spend too much time volunteering. Occasionally, I'll hit somebody with my car. So sue me. No, don't sue me. That's the opposite of the point that I am trying to make. I hate hospitals. In my mind, they are associated with sickness. She looks like an angel. She looks awful. No okay. She always looks like that, it was not my fault. I think she's awake. She's in the coma. I brought all your friends from the office. - At the same time. - Yep. - Hello, Meredith. - This is weird. Brought you some balloons. Why don't we Here you go. Tie these up, cheer up your tubes. Oh, for God's sake. - Nurse! - No, don't bother the nurse. Just put it back in. I am going to be sick. I'm going to puke. I wouldn't I wouldn't worry about it. - Don't touch it. - What are you doing? Just gimme that. Thanks. Does it hurt terribly? No, it's not too bad. They have me on a lot of painkillers. Really? What kind, codeine? Vicodin? Percocet? Fentanyl? Oxycontin? - Palladone? - I have no idea. Well, it was really great of all of you to come and visit me at the same time. I'll see you guys at the office. Okay, wait up, wait up, guys. Guys, guys, hold on a sec. You know what I was thinking might be sort of fun? Is if you forgave me in front of everybody. I'm not gonna do that. 'Cause you know what they say in the bible about forgiveness? Forgiveness is next to godliness. No, that's not - You cracked my pelvis. - Look, I jus I don't understand what is preventing you from laughing this off and giving me a big hug. You're not forgiven. Come on. Do I need to be liked? Absolutely not. I like to be liked. I enjoy being liked. I have to be liked. But it's not, like, this compulsive need to be liked. Like my need to be praised. Hey. hey, monkey. Any problems? Well, you left the TV on. And your cat is dead. - What?! - Sparkles, the white one, is dead. Sprinkles. That was the sick one, right? But I thought she had more time. Did she look When you saw her, how was she looking? Really dead. Like a, just a dead cat. So Hey, come on. Don't be sad. Just Okay? Just - She's in a better place. - All right. Actually, the place that she's in is the freezer. Because of the odor. It's gonna be okay. Okay, you know what? Everybody, let's just get over the whole Meredith thing. She cracked her pelvis. A tiny, little crack. And she's gonna be fine. So let just Michael, Angela's cat died. Sprinkles? I'm sorry, Angela. Man, what a day, huh? How could it get any worse? Her computer crashes with the porn, and then Meredith with the accident, and then Sprinkles! God! That's three things. I'll tell you what's going on. This office is cursed. And we need to do something about it. Well, I am taking responsibility. An it's up to me to get rid of the curse that hit Meredith with my car. I'm not supersticious, but I'm I am a little sticious. Did anyone do anything involving an indian burial ground? - Like what? - Like park on it. Or dig up a body. Toby? Do you have anything you wanna tell us? No, I did not violate an indian burial ground. In fact, I had some good luck recently. Alfredo's pizza picked my business card out of the basket, so I get a week of free pies. - That's cool. - Yeah. Perfect. So our tragedy is your good luck. Satan. Sprinkles never hurt a soul. God, in your infinite wisdom, how can you do this? She wasn't ready. She had so much left to accomplish. It is only a cat. You never You don't like them. Cats do not provide milk or wool or meat. - Dwight, you haven't seen Meredith? - No, I have not. Well, I think you should go to the hospital and pay your respects. I do not respect her. But I will go. All right. I would now like to talk about each of your individual religious beliefs. Oh, Michael, you can't ask about religious beliefs. Satan is the master of lies. Everything he says is the opposite. All right, well, then you can ask about religious beliefs. Thank you for the permission. Psych! Alright, let's just go around the room, and tell me what you believe in. - Catholic. - Okay. - Presbyterian. - Oh, me too. - For real? - Same religion. I'm a lutheran, and bob is a unitarian. It keeps things spicy. That's why we're cursed. I've been involved in a number of cults, both as a leader and a follower. You have more fun as a follower but you make more money as a leader. Kelly, you are hindu. So you believe in Buddha. That's buddhists. Are you sure? No. What are you? Well, if you're gonna reduce my identity to my religion, then I'm sikh. But I also like hip-hop and NPR. And I'm restoring a 1967 corvette in my spare time. Okay. So one sikh, and As a farmer, I know that when an animal is sick, sometimes the right thing to do is to put it out of its misery. With the electricity used to keep Meredith alive, we could power a small fan for two days. You tell me what's unethical. Blink once if you want me to pull the plug. Don't pull any plugs. How are you doing, miss Palmer? - Better. - Excellent. Are you a doctor or a male nurse? I'm an intern, which makes me a doctor. Her chart doesn't indicate that she had a hysterectomy, but she did, or at least, she got time off for one. So that is where her uterus went. Your last tetanus shot was when you were bitten by a bat a few months ago? Yes. Dwight here trapped it in a bag against my head. Just doing my job. You also were recently bitten by a raccoon? And a rat. Separate occasions. Spend your whole life trying to get people to like you, and then you run over one person with your car. And it's not even one of the popular ones. Everybody gets on your case. Doesn't make any sense. God is dead. If there was a god, then Ryan and I would be married by now. Maybe believing in god was a mistake. What did people believe in before? The sun? Maybe there's some sort of animal that we could make a sacrifice to. Like a giant buffalo. Or some sort of monster, like something with the body of a walrus with the head of a sea lion. Or something with the body of an egret with the head of a meerkat. Or just the head of a monkey with the antlers of a reindeer. With the body of a porcupine. I will do some research. - Okay. - I can help you with that. So just to be safe, they are giving her the rabies vaccine. God, rabies? I was in the hospital room with her. How contagious is that? Is that like an STD? - No. You gotta be bitten by something. - This place is so cursed. Actually, the doctor said she was lucky, 'cause the only way to beat rabies is to start treatment before the symptoms set in. Lockjaw. I know a lot of you are very upset with me for endangering Meredith's life by hitting her with my car. But it may make you feel a little bit better to know that before that happened Dwight endangered her life by putting a garbage bag over her head and it had a bat in it. Six of one, really. Turns out, Meredith has been exposed to rabies. Which is, like, ten times worse than a little crack in your pelvis. Thanks to me, she went to the hospital, and that saved her life. Curse is broken. Curse is broken, people! Oh, there is a god! And he has a plan for us after all. So go home, get some rest. Very, very good work today. Got a lot accomplished. Is there a god? If not, what are all these churches for? And who is Jesus' dad? Oh, well. If they aren't together now, then they probably never will be. I thought they'd be good together. Like PB &amp; J. Pam Beesly and Jim. What a waste. What a waste. I told you I'm not dating anyone. And even if I was, I don't think it's anyone's business. I mean, when I do fall in love, like, when it's for real, the last person I'm gonna talk about it to is a camera crew or my coworkers. Almost marrying Roy Anderson was as close to Pamela Anderson as I ever wanna be. Trust me, when I fall in love, you'll know. Michael Scott's Dunder Mifflin Scranton Meredith Palmer memorial celebrity rabies awareness fun run race for the cure, this is Pam. Pro-am. Pro-am race for the They hung up. A woman shouldn't have to be hit by a car to learn that she may have rabies. But that is where we are in America. And that does not sit right with me. And that is why I'm hosting a fun run race for the cure for rabies To raise awareness of the fact that there is a cure for rabies. A disease that has been largely eradicated in the U.S. But not very many people know that. No, rabies. Babies would be a good idea. Can I put you down for a dime? Hi, Stankley, how many sponsors so far? Zero. Come on, man. You gotta step it up. It's for a good cause. Jan called this morning and pledged $500. Isn't that your money? That is for a good cause. - Phyllis, how the rabies quilt coming? - Oh, it's coming. Oh, look at that! Three. Way to honor Meredith, Phyllis. You can't make me run. It is not a real charity. It's stupid, Michael and I'm not gonna do it. You didn't run for me when I thought I had skin cancer. I know that you're probably scared of people seeing your fat legs in shorts. Well, back in olden times, a large, fat person like this was a person of power. A person who had money, who could buy food. A person of respect, like the regional manager of the day. Whereas someone athletic and trim like myself was somebody who worked in the fields, and I was a peasant. I just don't wanna run. I didn't bring my sneakers or my clothes. You're gonna have to run or you're gonna be in a lot of trouble. It is not olden times anymore. I'm petrified of nipple chafing. Once it starts, is a vicious circle. You have sensitive nipples, they chafe. So they become more sensitive. So they chafe more. So I take precautions. Hey, Angela. I'm sorry about your cat. This is Sprinkles. She was my best friend. I kept her going through countless ailments. I asked Dwight Schrute to feed her once, and she is now deceased. This is Halloween last year. Just a couple of kittens. Out on the town. I'm having relationship problems. And since you're always having relationship problems, I thought you could give me some advice. What's wrong? I have this crazy thought that I know is crazy that maybe Dwight killed my cat. When I got home, Sprinkles' body was in the freezer where Dwight said he left her. But all my bags of frozen french fries had been clawed to shreds! Something's not right. The vet's doing an autopsy. Angela, I'm sorry. Did Roy ever killed one of your cats? I'm more of a dog person. So what's your strategy for this race? I'm gonna start fast. Then I'm gonna run fast in the middle. Then I'm gonna end fast. - Why won't more people do that? - 'Cause they're stupid. What? Oh, um, no, that's not - I mean, that wasn't - Yeah, that was, um I mean, I can see how it would seem a bit like we, uh How it looks like, um But nowadays, you can edit anything, right? I mean, you can edit anything to Look like, um, anything. - So - Yeah, I gave him a ride home - because - Right. We're dating. There it is. Uh, yeah. We haven't told anybody, but it's going really great. Right? It is going really great. Shut up! You're taking this out on me, but I was only the messenger. Oh, really? You'll feel better after the 5k. Exercise is good for depression. I am not depressed. I'm in grief! We have raised almost $700, most of it from me and Jan. When do they put that on the giant check? Or is that something that we write in later? Well, a giant check costs about $200 to make up. I have a print shop standing by, but What do you think, Michael? That's over 25% of our funds. It's a tough decision. I always imagined it with a giant check. Yeah, I mean, I personally am definitely on board for the giant check. Giant check it is. I don't know. On the other hand, it does leave less money for bat birth control. Bat birth control. This money's going to bat birth control, right? That's what you told me. You didn't contribute very much. I was also hoping to hand the giant check to a rabies doctor. - How's that going? - Not well. A doctor won't come out to collect a check for $700. Or $500 if we go with the giant check. - Which we are. - And also There is no such thing as a rabies doctor. How about a rabies nurse? - I don't think so. - You know what? I've actually seen ads for nurses that you can hire by the hour. For parties and bachelor events. That's possible. look into that. Great, it's gonna cost 200 bucks. And actually, more with tips. Maybe we should skip the ceremony and just set up a college fund for Meredith's son. Have you met that kid? I'm not going to college. not 5,000 miles. Come in. - My god! - What're you doing?! - You said, "come in!" - No, I didn't. Just - Oh, my god. - Please, get out. So I closed the door but the image of his - Baguette. - dangling participle still burned in my eyes. I can imagine. Come in. May I enter the room? Yes. Or "come in. " See how I did that? That's the way you should enter a room. You knock and wait for the all clear. You couldn't undress in the men's room? Yes. But I have an office, so why would I do that? On average, how many hours a day do you spend naked in your office? - Just ballpark. - European offices are always naked. - They're so not. - Besides, my shirt covered most of it. I only saw where it ended. - Gross. - That's not gross! It's the human body. What is your problem? Pam, you're an artist, right? Think of me as one of your models. Okay, you know what? I don't want this to detract from what we really need to think about today. It's not fair to people with rabies. And that's the point, right? Okay. Let's go have some fun all right. They say if you're nervous around someone, you should picture them naked. I do not recommend this strategy. Try picturing them with more clothes on. Or a funny coat. I'm sorry, is this a working office? And not a french beach? Okay, name, please? Creed Bratton, 75+ division. - You're over 75 years old? - 82 november 1st. - How much is the prize money? - There's no prize money. Well, is any of this real? Check that out. Look at me, I'm Toby! I'm stretching. I know what I'm doing. Why is he even here? So I heard that you were peeping on Michael. What? No, it was not I don't know what your deal is, but he's mine, okay? So hands off. Okay, everybody, listen up! Thank you for coming. Before we get started, I want to say a few words about this deadly disease called rabies. And I'd like you to take a look into the face of rabies. That should scare you. It scares me. You people need to educate yourselves. Meth: three americans every year die from rabies. Fact: four americans every year die from rabies. How many of you know someone who has been afflicted or affected by rabies? Show of hands. One, two, three too many to count. It is truly the silent killer. No, it is the foaming, barking killer. And it is something that Darryl! - What're you doing? - I give him a peanut. No, don't give him Just Did you hear anything I said? - Look how happy he is. - He's happy because he's insane. That's a perfect example of the kind of awareness we need to generate. Where's the nurse? - This is the reason we're here. - Hello, Michael. Oh, hey, I know you. - Elizabeth, right? - Yeah. Very cool you went back and got your degree. I would like you to accept this check for $340 made out to Science. Make sure that that gets into the right hands. You got it? Okay. Fettuccini Alfredo. Time to carbo load. Just remember, folks, it's not about winning, it is about finishing. On your marks! Get set! On your left! You're doing great, Michael. Look at you go! That's my boss! - Yeah, baby! - I'm fast. I'm very fast. I'm like Forrest Gump, except I am not an idiot. Oh, yes, I will work out today. I will work out a way to avoid running for a stupid cause. I've walked 2 marathons. Pretty sure I can handle a 5k. The key is drafting to eliminate wind resistance. Yeah. Oh, we're in last place. - Oh, would you look at that? - Darn it. Water! Water. - Water, babe? - No, no water for me. Not while rabies causes fear of water. Solidarity! Michael, that's irrational! Rabies victims have to live with an irrational hatred of water their entire lives. So least I could do. Oh, god. My nipples! It's starting. - Can we get another round? - Okay. Thanks. So we've got what? Another 20 minutes? More or less. That fettuccini is hitting my stomach like a rock. You got nothing to worry about. I put imodium in Toby's coffee before the race. Excellent! Simpsons! Wait, imodium or ex-lax? I'm making great time. Usually I have to take a bathroom break halfway through a race like this, but not today. Ooh, an estate sale. Want to go in? I'm really committed to winning. Okay, but what if I told you that all the money you spend here goes to preventing a disease already cured. - Yes. - That's what I thought. - Yeah. - Right? Let's do some good. You have reached the offices of Dunder Mifflin Scranton.  Currently the entire staff is out doing the Michael scott D.M.S.M.P.M.C. Rabies awarness pro-am fun run race  For the cure.  Leave a message.  Oh, god. Oh, Alfredo sauce. I'm getting a stitch. God! Watch the nipples, Kevin! Back off me. You're feeling better? No. Well, you look cute as a button. You've worked up quite a sweat. The vet's removing Sprinkles' organs right now and sending them to the lab. - I am a farmer, Angela. - What does that mean? When a farmer sees an animal that is in pain, that has no quality of life, that has no utility, a farmer does what city folk don't have the stomach to do. You did kill her! I sang her her favorite songs. You put her in my freezer! It was beautiful and gentle and respectful. I fed her antihistamines and she gradually fell asleep. She barfed them up in the freezer and tried to get out. I'm not responsible for that - It's nothing! - I'm robbing her! - It's nothing! - It's nothing! It's fine! How could you do that without telling me? I thought I was helping you. I expected a hug. I took care of that cat the best way I knew how. Cat heaven is a beautiful place, but you don't get there if you're euthanized. I know a great taxidermist. I'll pay to have her stuff. Well, he's not great, but he's pretty good. You don't understand. Take bat bites seriously. Don't get bit. Or we can have her buried out at the east field by mother. - Huh, Angela? - Don't touch me, Dwight. You like it? It's kind of designy and cool. It was $8. Oh, and I get to carry it. And the winner is Toby Flenderson! Have a seat. I'll write it down. Where are we? I don't know. Like five kilometers from the office. He couldn't have made it circle? I am not going to finish. I can't beat rabies. Nobody can beat rabies. Rabies has been around for a thousand years. I was a fool to think that I could beat it. - Pictures of the dog all around. - Yeah, probably What are you doing here? Did you come back for us or I can't finish. I feel so weak. I just - You're probably dehydrated. - What do you want me to do, Jim? A glass of water would be a start. There are people all over the world with all sorts of problems and afflictions and diseases. They're deformed and they're abnormal, and they're illiterate and ugly. Symphonies don't have any money. Public TV is bust. I can't do anything about it. I can't, you know There's just one of me, and there's thousand of them. And rabies wins. You are a downer. We were having a pretty nice day. I'm still having a nice day. - You are? - Yeah. Hey, Michael, look at this lamp. $8. That's a good deal. And Michael, you don't have rabies. And chances are you're not gonna get it anytime soon. So you don't really have to think about it too much. Pam, if everybody felt that way, nothing would get done. Yeah, but there's other better people out there who are helping. You just don't think I am capable of making a difference. I know you, Michael. I saw you naked. You don't You don't know me. You've just seen my penis. I can make a difference. Remember, I'm the one who started this whole thing off by hitting Meredith with my car. And I owe it to her to finish this G.D. 5k. Finishing that 5k was the hardest thing I have ever had to do. I ate more Fettuccine Alfredo and drank less water than I have in my entire life. People always talk about triumphs of the human spirit. Today, I had a triumph of the human body. That's why everybody was applauding for me at the end. My guts and my heart. And while I eventually puked my guts out, I never puked my heart out. And I'm very, very proud of that. Hey, Michael. Hey, Mer. - How you doing? - Better. It's ironic, isn't it? I mean, I'm in the hospital for not getting enough water. And you're in it for a disease that causes a fear of water. I'm in because you hit me with your car. But I want to say I heard you were trying really hard, so I'm not mad at you anymore. Thanks. I'm not mad at you anymore. Want to share? Sure. I'm not really sick. I'm good. - Hey, I got you one. - Hey. Thank you. I was gonna grab some chips, you want some? No, thanks. We're still having lunch today, right? I guess. How dare you? Hey, Toby? What's this? I just wanna remind everyone about the company rules involving PDA, - or public displays of affection. - Yes Some people in the office have complained. - Oh, really. - About other people engaging in PDA. And you know, just wanted to remind them it's not appropriate to do that. Is this about me and Jan in my office? Because I'll have you know that that was consensual. What we did has nothing to do with you or anyone here. I don't think anyone heard anything. We're very discreet. And most people had left by that point. So I don't think it's any of your business. What I think you should do, is roll up the memo real tight Okay, look, the memo was not out you. For the record, I've never been involved with anyone at work in any capacity. All right, everyone, look. All right, the complaint was about Jim and Pam - No way. - What? You guys are together? Yep. Yes, we are. - Tuna! - Awesome! I knew it! To the two of you. Toby, was this your fun little way of congratulating us? - Yes. - Okay. Mind is exploding. Get over here. Come on. Come here. Okay, stand up. Here we go. Everyone, this is a day that will live in infamy. Because today is the day that Jim and Pam - become one. - Actually, we're dating for 2 months. I love you guys so much. - Phone's ringing. - No, no. Pam, let'em ring. Let the bells of Dunder-Mifflin chime out your love. Because this is really good. This is really good. My heart soars with the eagle's nest. I don't see it. I think they both could do better. It's not a surprise to me. Pam is the office mattress. Jim Halpert's off the market. Guess who just became the best looking single guy in the office?

Blowing up balloons, I thought. You might wanna trim it a little? - Michael. - Oh, is Ryan coming back today? Yeah, he is. Pam and Jim are together. Ryan is visiting. Only thing that could make this day better is ice cream. What do you want? To give you this. - What is that? - It's a ferel barn cat. I trapped him and I'm giving him to you as a replacement cat for the one I destroyed. Her name was Sprinkles. And his name is Garbage. Most calls him Garbage 'cause he likes to eat garbage. Don't you, Garbage? I can't believe you just thought you could replace Sprinkles, before she's even in the ground. You haven't buried her yet? Don't rush me. I'm grieving. Garbage can be very helpful, okay? He's a useful cat. He killed an entire family of raccoons. Look at him. I don't want Garbage. I want Sprinkles! Hey Toby. Hey, Pa - You two. - Hey. So now that we are dating, we just wanted to know if we had to sign one of those "we're dating" things for the company. Oh, well, you know, those are only for, you know, relationships. So if it's just a casual thing, there's no need, really. Well, I don't wanna speak for Jim, but it's, like, pretty official. Sorry, so do we need to sign one, or Let's just wait and see what happens, you know. - What? - Well, let's just wait. - Oh, okay. - Okay. Great. - Hey, Ryan. - Hold on one sec. Hey, Pam. It's great to see you. Is Michael in? - Hey, there he is! - Yeah. He's back! And he's with a beard. He has facial hair. Look at him! All grown up and no place to go. Hello, M. Sonny Crocket. I'm Tubbs. Okay. Should we get started? Yeah, let's get started because, uh, yes. - 'Cause this is very serious business. - Yeah, exactly. This is a business meeting. - Fire guy! - Stop that! That's right! Fire guy! Don't start any fires, Ryan. Fire guy! - You weren't here for that. - Here for what? - When he started the fire. - Look how big he is. Look at you! You are so mature and old and little man now. - You're like our little man. - Little old man boy. - Michael, everybody - Bearded like man boy. Let me say something. I know I used to be a temp here, but now everything is different. I'd like your respect. I'm your boss now. You're gonna have to treat me the same way you treated Jan. - So - That's a little kinky. I don't swing that way. - I think Ryan has a gay crush on me. - Enough, okay! This is inappropriate and it stops right now. - Do you understand? - Yes. Everybody, come on. Settle down. Let's get serious here. Ryan has a very special important presentation to do which we will be doing in the conference room in ten minutes. - Perfect. - Sound good? Okay. All right. Yeah, Ryan snapped at me. Bu there was this twinkle in his eye that I picked up on which said, "Dude, we're friends. "I'm doing this for appearances. "I'm the big boss now. "And I have to seem like an ogre. "But you know me "and you trust me, "and we like each other. "And we'll always be friends. "And I would never take you for granted "in a million years. "And I miss you, man. "And I love you." His words. Dunder-Mifflin Infinity represents a floor to ceiling streamlining of our business model. The center piece of the campaign is a new business to business website interface that will allow us to compete directly with big box chains. Wait a second. Last time I checked, Dunder-Mifflin already has a website. And quite frankly, I'm not really sure what's wrong with it. This is a massive overhaul. We're getting younger, sleeker and more agile with the way that we adapt to the marketplace. Essential personal will be issued blackberries for company use. Gimme, gimme. I'll stick around for a while to help you set them up. Any questions? What if we don't wanna use a blackberry because they are stupid and pointless? - This's company-wide, Dwight. - Got it. You should call it Dunder-Mifflinfinity. You know, push the words together. Any other questions? Can we speak privately about our relationship? Thank you, everybody! Ryan Howard everybody! Good job! That was some fun stuff. When's the website go up? As fast as possible. We wanna start re-training people ASAP, to hit the ground running with the new system. Cool beans. - We're screwed. - Who is? Us, you and me. The old timers. I am not old. You are old. You are, like, a 100. You're over 40. That's the cut off. Are you listening to what he's saying? Re-training. New system, youth. I'm telling you, this kid is the grim reaper. You deal with this, or you, me, Sammy, Phyllis, the chick you hit with the car, we're goners. I swore I wouldn't tell anybody this, but in the interest of revealing secrets Oh, my god, this is gonna make your brain explode. Dwight and Angela dating. Have been for six months. Swear to god. This is great. I was gonna wait and tell you on your birthday, but this is much more fun. No, they have been dating for, like, two years. Since before your barbeque. Wait, what? You knew. And you didn't say anything? You didn't say anything to me. Fair enough. We should have started dating, like, a long time ago. Sorry, I didn't know you guys were in here. - No, we're just sitting here. - I couldn't see your hands. Oh, hey Pam, by the way, it's great that you're dating. But when a new client calls, you just have to randomly assign them to a sales person. You can't base who gets new clients on who you're sleeping with that week. Okay? - Okay. - Okay. Okay. And that is why we waited so long to tell people. - Okay, what's up? - Yeah, okay. Um, I was just After the presentation, wanted to make sure that vis-a-vis me in the office, everything is business as usual. Well, it's business but not as usual. Yeah, no, I understand. We're making great strides and you're updating. - But business as usual, no? - No. We threw out the playbook, we start from scratch. We're implementing a brand new system. - Good, so we're on the same page. - No. We're not. Michael, I know exactly how much time and manpower are waisted in this branch. This company is getting younger, faster, more efficient. You need to prepare yourself. We had a foreign exchange student live with us when I was young. And we called him my brother. And that's what I thought he was. Um, and then he went home to what is now formerly Yugoslavia, taking all of my blue jeans with him. And I just spent the entire winter in shorts. That is what Ryan is like: a fake brother who steals your jeans. So - How are you? - Awesome. I am dating a lot of guys. - Good. - A lot. Black guys, mostly. What? Wait How do you touch just one of these buttons at a time? I don't know. Did you even try? If the kid wants to set mine up, I'll let him. I can't see half the things. It's too little. Use the phone. I want you to tell me that you care about me. That is what I want. Kelly, I'm your boss now, okay? Stop talking to me like I'm your boyfriend. Oh, big strong man. Fancy new whatever. - You never cared about me. - I never cared about you? Six months ago, Karen Filippelli sent me an email asking me out. I said no because I was committed to our relationship. Well, I hope you're still committed, because I'm pregnant. And guess what buddy? I am keeping it. - You feel prepared to raise a baby? - I ca I can't talk about this right now, okay? After work, we'll go out to dinner, we'll talk about it then, okay? We have a date! - Hello. - Hello, Dwight. I've been thinking about things and I wanted to know if you would have dinner with me tonight. Really? Yes. I'll make a reservation. No, no, let me cook for you. Cauliflower and noodles. Baked potato on the side. I would prefer a public place. See you after work. - Hi, Pam. - Hi. - Is Michael in? - In his office. Go right in. So, elephant in the room, I have your old job. Well, not exactly my job. - A different title. - Oh, well, excuse me. Same office. Same responsibilities. Different salary. You'll get there. Don't worry. - You look great. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Scranton seats you. Best decision I ever made. You were let go. You know what? Love the beard, keep it forever. What is the actual deal with these things in terms of testicles? What? I don't wanna grow weird sperm in case we ever wanna have kids. So what's Ryan doing here? I don't know. They're launching a big new business plan, a new website. He's being a real twerp about it though. It's all about youth, and agily, and streamlining. - Try to squeeze out the older people. - He's such a snake. Hope he gets them an ageism suit. What is that word? Ageism? The companies, they can't discriminate against people due to old age. Two years ago, we tried to force out some of the older branch managers with a mandatory retirement age and then Ed Truck, your old boss, threatened us with a lawsuit. So, we had to back off. So older people have just as many rises as younger people. Yes, Michael. They do. - Creed? - Yes, sir? - Everything okay? - Everything's cool, dude. I'm 30. Well, in november, I'll be 30. Another meeting's scheduled? I was gonna do the blackberry tutorial, in here. Michael told us to wait in here, we don't know why. Oh, man. Good, we're all here. - We can get started. - Michael. Have a seat. Have a seat like everybody else. Okay, this is for everyone's Still my office, Ryan. Well, there has been a lot of talk about new ideas today. Well new ideas are fine. But they are also illegal. Because they are a form of ageism. What? Yes, I am right. Did you know that the age discrimination and employment act of 1967 prohibits employment discrimination based on age with respect to employees I did. Technically, he's right. Hey, shut up, Toby. Why do we as a society hate old people so much? - Because they're lame. - No! Creed, no, they are not. In fact, many cultures revere old people because of their storytelling ability. Like the old lady from Titanic. Or the funny things that they can do, like, "Where's the beef?" - Yeah. - Why the big picture's up again? You used that when you burned your foot. We were using the Ben Kingsley too. I was going to put up some new pictures, but, all of the ink in the printer was gone. - Michael Scott? - That is me! Come on in. Whis this old fart? Did you just stagger off the street, out of a box or something? Who's this worthless bag of bones? Well, this guy is none other than one of the founders of Dunder-Mifflin, Mr. Robert Dunder. Oh, yeah! Yes! - Michael, can I talk to you for a sec? - Sure thing. Excuse me. - We've actual work to do. - Fine. Then I'll call David Wallace and you can explain to him why you threw the founder of the company out on his ancient butt. Bob, how old are you? - I'm 87. - 87 years young. And still tive. That is great. Did you know that Bob is still a member of the board of Dunder-Mifflin? Well, I haven't been to a board meeting in years. I send a proxy. Still sends his own proxy. Good for you. I'm going to live for a very long time. My grandma Schrute lived to be 101. My grandpa Mannheim is 103, and still puttering around down in Argentina. I tried to go visit him once but my travel visa was protested by the Shoah foundation. I started this company in 1949. Back then, it was an industrial supplier of metal brackets, mostly for construction. Oh, boy. And then Mifflin, of course he killed himself later, but I knew Mifflin through the rotary club. Great. He was He was at dinner with Beverly and her husband. What was his name? Uh,`jerry. Jerry Trupiano from South Jersey. And he was tall. Both he and Mifflin were tall guys. Great. That's great. Thank you for coming in. Robert Dunder, everybody. Thank you. That was wonderful. - Do you have a ride? - Well, I came here in a cab. - Perfect. - Well, could you give me another Inspirational. What have we learned? Well, we have learned that you can't teach an old dog new tricks. Because it's illegal and you will go to jail. I should help him get home. No, no, don't help him! He doesn't need help, Pam. What a nice guy. Good night, guys. Well, today was a fantastic waste of time. I disagree. It think it was very valuable. Michael, technology helps business, okay? You shouldn't resist it. This is the way the world is moving. I happen to think that old ways of doing business are better. And I can prove it. - Okay. - I look forward to hearing your ideas. - Where do you wanna go? - Some place romantic and expensive. Kelly, come on. You know what? You're right. I'm feeling kind of nauseous, anyway. So we can just skip it. Are you enjoying your vegetarian noodles? Very much. How is your meat? Dry, delicious. - I heard a joke today. - Oh, that's funny. Yes, it was. Are you enjoying your mineral water? - I can't do this. - What? I can't be with you. Every time I look in your eyes, I see Sprinkles' stiff, lifeless body. Then don't look in my eyes. Look right here. It's an old sales trick. I'm sorry. I gave this everything I could. No, please don't do this, monkey. I will leave your toothbrush on top of your tire tomorrow morning. Smell that. You smell that? - Dry rot. - No, Dwight. That smells like good business to me. What I've done here, is I have collected the finest gourmet items that Scranton has to offer. - Sweet, chocolate turtles. - Yes. Nope! No, those are for our clients. Actually, our ex-clients. I'll explain later. Ryan wants everything in our company to be about emails and I.M.S. But I think he is forgetting about the original instant message. Letters attached to baskets of food. Excuse me, Angela. Michael asked me to turn in these receipts for these gift basket items. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Is that all? - Yes. I miss you. Elevators. Dwight, you have to listen to me. We are not seeing each other anymore. Can you accept that? Fine. Then I just wanna be friends. Good. Plus a little extra. Also, I love you. I don't understand what the big deal is. - You lied about being pregnant. - Right, so? You really don't understand why that makes me angry? - No. - We're never getting back together. Why not? All right, I just have to ask. Now that we're public is the magic gone? It's funny you bring that up, because yes, it is. I knew it. Oh, man. - Just like that, huh? - I think I mean, I don't-- I don't know what it is, but - Be honest. - I now find you repulsive. That's honest. All right, fair enough. It was really fun while it lasted, though, wasn't it? Yeah. For me it was. Okay. All right. Hey, boss. I didn't know you were coming in today. What's, uh, going on here? I am glad that you asked. Listen up, everybody! In the last year, we have lost seven clients to the big chains. These gift baskets are our ticket back into their lives. We are going to show up at these businesses unannounced, - and we are going to win them back. - With gift baskets. With peanut brittle. With macadamia nut cookies. With chocolate turtles. With raspberry jam. And a little bit of fat and salt. Because you know what? That's what people like. Ever since I was a kid, people have been telling me that I can't do things. "You can't be on the team." "You can't move on to second grade." Well, now they're telling me that I can't win back clients using old fashioned business methods. We'll see about that. And FYI, I eventually hated second grade. And I was the biggest kid in class. Okay, we're gonna split up into teams. Jim, Phyllis; Stanley, Dwight; me, Andy. I'm not driving with him. - I'll go with you, Stanley. - Or him. - Why don't we just go by ourselves? - Why don't we just go as teams to demonstrate our teamsmenship. This is stupid. What-- okay. That's not helpful, Phyllis. How is giving people gift baskets going to get our clients back? Gift baskets are amazing, Phyllis. Gift baskets are the essence of class and fanciness. They are the ultimate present that a person can receive. What about cash? Cash can buy whatever you want, including a gift basket, so it's kind of the best gift ever. - What about a gift basket full of cash? - Yes! Cash basket! Nice work, Tuna. Fine, I'm just gonna go by myself, and I am going to win them back by myself. Because this is important to me. Michael, wait. Let me go. No, this is my quest. Please let me go. I need to win those clients back. - Please. - Fine. Then god speed. To both of us. Good luck, Michael. We don't need luck. Yeah. But thank you, that was really nice of you to say. Business to business. The old fashioned way. No blackberries, no websites. I would like to see a website deliver baskets of food to people. Yes, I understand that, David. I just felt that if we were to downsize Kelly, and then outsource customer service to India, which a lot of companies Yes, no-- Yes, Kelly is indian. I understand that's confusing. Hey, brah. Been meaning to ask you, can we get some Red Bull for these things? Sometimes a guy's gotta ride the bull. Am I right? Later, skater. Sweet ride. American made. What happened to the sebring? It is in the body shop. I had to have the dent taken out of the hood where I hit Meredith. - That's a pain in the ass. - I know. - So who's next? - Larry Meyers. Left us six months ago for Office Depot. Proceed to the highlighted route then route guidance will begin. Why do you use that thing? It lets them know where you are at all times. Who? The government, spy satellites, private detectives. Ex-girlfriends. Next night, I'm out at a bar, 2:00 AM. I figure I'll get a sandwich. 'Cause you can get a sandwich any time of the night. I run into Vince Vaughn. - No way. - Literally. Dude, you are so money. But you dot even know it. But you do. - Later, guys. - Yeah - Later, dude. - Later, man. How awesome is Ryan now? Yeah, he's definitely something. - What does that mean? - That whole lifestyle his whole vibe? You find that appealing? Tuna! He has a killer job. He's rich. He smells like what I think Pierce Brosnan probably smells like. He wears really cool rich guy cloth. And he can get any girl that he wants. So, sorry, Tuna, but if you don't know why that awesome, then you need awesome lessons. Tuna, check ya later. 'Cause he's so money that he doesn't even know it. Those things are heavy. There's a lot of stuff in there. We have macadamia nut cookies, the honey mustard pretzels. Have you ever tried focaccia crisps? You know we closed our account, right? - Yes, we do. - We're with Office Depot now. - Yes. - Yes, we know. - But we just have not gotten over you. - Well And we are dedicated to providing you with the very best customer service. - This is true. - The best personal business relation We can if you ever decide to come back to us. Okay. I don't think we're coming back. - Please come back. - Okay, you know what? Just enjoy the gift basket and remember that we provide a personal touch. Remember what we had, Larry? I mean, really, it's about money. Well, just enjoy the gift basket. - Okay, than. - All right. I mean, their website's really easy to use too. That's a big deal for us. That guy was so st How can't they know how much better we are? I don't know. Sometimes people are just impossible and make you miserable. That is true. Like Angela in accounting. Yes, she is nuts. No, she's wonderful. At accounting. But she drives me crazy. Make the next right turn. How do they know? How does this know where to turn? That's very impressive. Hey, Pam. I haven't settled on a final design logo yet for Dunder Mifflin Infinity. And I know you're into graphic design. You wanna give it a shot? - Maybe try and design the logo? - Uh, totally. Cool. That would be great. Can you do a couple mock-ups and I'll take a look? - Yeah. Thank you. - Thank you very much. - Cool. - Okay. Yeah, I'm gonna do some mock-ups and then turn those into thumbnails. Maybe do some, uh, splash frames. I don't know what I'm talking about, but I'm excited. And the last guy says, no, Harry Body. You know I have heard it before. Well, it's still very good. I bet I know someone who hasn't heard that joke. Your daugther Emily. How's she doing? She's great. Thanks for asking. Great memory, by the way. She gonna be, like, 11 this winter? They grow up so fast. I have a few of my own that I want someday. I don't wanna take any more of your time, you're a busy man. The reason we have stopped by is to drop you off this elaborate bag of goodies. And to ask you to reconsider. Oh, okay. Okay? Okay! So you'll reconsider? Okay, thanks for the goodies. Is that all you have to say? It looks delicious? I don't know. You don't know? Look We want you back. Can you offer lower prices? - Well, no. - Then we're not coming back. - He's not coming back. It's over. - No, it's not. - No, he's right. - Accept it, why would he come back? Why would he come back? I'll tell you, Dwight. He would come back because we offer a wide selection of products, and you're not getting the same customer service that you get with us, are you? That's not gonna change his mind. He's moving on. We had our chance and we killed it. Look We're also coming out with a website soon. It's a staf-the-art thing. It'll be up and running. It's gonna cut costs and it will make ordering much easier. Well, okay. Well, when it's up, i'll check it out and if it really cuts costs, maybe we'll come back. Great. The magic of the gift basket. That I don't care about as much. Let me know when the site's up. Okay. Good. Don't let Emily have any of the almonds. She's allergic. Proceed straight. Well, we're 0 for 6. Last chance is the Elmhurst Country Club. Other side of the lake on the southeast side. I don't get it. I really don't get it. I thought this would work. I threw everything I had at that guy, nothing. That's how it goes sometimes, you know? You lose everything, and everything falls apart. And eventually you die and no one remembers you. That is a very good point. Make a right turn. Wait, wait! No, no. It means bear right. - Right there. - No, it said right. It said, take a right. No, no, look. It means go up to the right, bear right over the bridge and hook up with 307. Maybe it's a short cut. It said, go to the right. It can't mean that. - It's a lake there! - It knows where it's going! - This is the lake! - The machine knows. Stop yelling at me! No, it's up there! There's no road here! Remain calm. I have trained for this. Okay. Exit the window! - Here we go. - Make a U-turn. If possible. Look out for nature! Michael! Are you okay? Swim for it! I got you! I got you! Michael! Let go. Let go off me! I've got you! I've got you! Come on! Come on! You sure you're okay? Fine. Good. That is what's most important. Did you get the rental insurance? 'Cause that is pretty important too at a time like this. What a disaster. This whole thing. I'll call a cab. These people just don't realize what a gift basket means. They don't get it. Look, still works. Old fashioned cell phone. Yeah. What about that last guy, Aaron? Is he a jerk I don't even know if I want it. Their website, so easy. Yeah, well, you can have your technology, jackass. - Look where it got us. - Yes, we need a cab at Lake Scranton. At the end of East Mountain Road. - In the lake. - Hang up. You know what we're gonna do? We're walking back. We're walking back to that office. And we are going to re-claim our gift basket! We're going to take what's rightfully ours. We're gonna take a stand, Dwight. - We're gonna take a stand! - Take a stand! So plays on the infinity thing without being obvious Yeah, definitely. I'd love to do, like, a color version. Just bring a little color I like it a lot. It's clear and subtle at the same time. It's really good. You've a real talent for this. - Thanks. - I'd love to talk to you about it more. - That'd be great. - Do you wanna go out to dinner tonight? - Oh, is it - Wear something nice. - No. - What? - I just wanted to have dinner. - I'm sorry. I'm dating Jim. You're kidding. We're together. That's great. That's awesome. Yeah, great. - So let me - Yeah. - Let me look at these. - Okay, great. Great. I guess he can't get any girl he wants. Do you forget something? What happened to you guys? Give it back. The gift basket. Give it back. - What is this? - It's real simple. If you don't appreciate what we do, then give us back our basket. Maybe you should leave. Yeah, maybe we should. Maybe we should leave. Come on, let's leave. But before we leave, my wet friend and I are gonna wait for our cabs on your nice couches! Can you call us a cab, please? I'm gonna-- Oh, sorry! - Look. - My clothes are so wet. Nice leather. My shoes are so muddy! All right, here you go. Take it back! - It's open. - Yeah, it was mine. What's missing? The turtles. Where are the turtles? Come on. Get out of here! Where are the turtles?! - Where are they? - I've an announcement to make. We seem to be missing a box of chocolate turtles with pecans. And we will not be leaving the premise until we obtain them. Hand over the turtles now! I ate them, okay? I ate the turtles. They're gone! We'll bill you. May I have your attention, please? This office will not be using any new technology ever, starting now. That is not correct. Ryan thinks that technology is the answer. Well, guess what? I just drove my car into a lake. - You did what? - I drove my car into a f*ing lake. Why, you may ask, did do this? Well because of a machine. A machine told me to drive into a lake. And I did it. I did it because I trusted Ryan's precious technology. - And look where it got me. - Into a lake. Exactly. Did you get any clients back? Maybe. Maybe not. Time will tell. But I will tell you one thing, those gift baskets never endanger anybody's lives. Game, set, match. Point. Scott. Game over. End of game. Everyone always wants new things. Everybody likes new inventions, new technology. People will never be replaced by machines. In the end, life and business are about human connections. And computers are about trying to murder you in a lake. And to me, the choice is easy. And the same thing goes for quarterly reports. They're unreadable. They're just numbers, and boring, and black. So what I was thinking is that maybe we should have some sort of graphic. Like if we have a bad quarter, put in a storm cloud. And, when we have a good quarter fireworks. Or a race car. Doesn't have to be a race car. Use your imagination. There's this cube on the screen, and it bounces around all day. And sometimes it looks like it's heading right into the corner of the screen and at the last minute it hits the wall and bounces away. We are all just dying to see it go right into the corner. Pam claims that she saw it one day when she was alone in the conference room. Okay I believe she thinks she saw it. I saw it. I saw it, and it was amazing. Who said I didn't see it? Did Jim say that? I saw it! We have a lot of colored paper here. Why, oh, why, do we keep printing this on white? No! Come on! Yeah. I know. I know. It's bland. - It's never gonna happen. - Dude, you've gotta believe. Maybe we could have some sort of riddle - Wait for it. - Like something that you have to look for Sort of a Where's Waldo? All r- All right. Let's quit while we're ahead. - That was so awesome. - That was awesome. Thank you. Some days, I am just on fire. What can I say? Episode 4x03 "LAUNCH PARTY" Hey, there he is. Hey, Meredith. How you feeling? I never thanked you for coming. Oh, please, it was my pleasure. Well, we all came, so Well, I real appreciate you coming. I'm singling you out. Anyway, I have this sharpie. And I was wondering if you could sign my cast. - Can you write where I can read it? - Yep. I'll read this when I get home. All right. Michael, this is the press release I told you about. Ryan wants you to share it. Oh, does he? He does. Okay. Attention, earthlings. I have some news. Today's the big day that I'm heading to New York to attend a party with sushi and important people. On an unrelated note, if anybody has an interesting anecdote that is not boring and easy to memorize please drop by my office before I leave. Thank you. Was that really what Ryan wanted you to tell us? And "Today the Dunder Mifflin Infinity website officially launches. " Well, the website is the brainchild of my brainchild, Ryan. It is my brain grandchild. And, to celebrate its birth, all of the different branches are going to have satellite parties which will be connected via web cams and fibers to the real party, which is going on in New York City at a very exclusive nightclub. And that is where all of the VIPs, including yours truly, will be partying with new york city's finest. And I do not mean policemen. "The company is projecting record high sales "and that by 6:00, the website will be the new best salesman in the company. " Watch out, Dwight. That's ridiculous. I'm not gonna be beaten by a website. - Actually, it sounds like you are. - Really? 'Cause Ryan says so? That's from Ryan? Does it mention if he's seeing anybody? No. I'll find out tonight. Yes, please let us know. I can make more sales than a computer. In fact, I challenge that website to make more sales than me today. - Waste of time. - What's tha pipsqueak? Waste of time. The website's going to win. - You believe a computer can beat me? - I don't care, but yes. - I'll prove you wrong. - I don't care, and you won't. - You'll see. - I won't be watching, and I won't. Dwight mercy killed Angela's cat. It's very complicated. It's caused a lot of unpleasantness between Dwight and Angela. Who were both already prone to unpleasantness. Stanley, you're dancing. No, I'm not. Yeah, I created a website. Look. At the end of the day, Apple's apple is flying at 30,000 feet. This is a paper company. And I don't want us to get lost in the weeds or into a beauty contest. I told you I don't want you doing these things. You can use your own office or do it in the hall. Convergence, viral marketing. We're going guerilla. We take it to the streets while keeping an eye on the stree, Wall Street. I don't want to reinvent the wheel here. In other words, it is what it is. Buying paper just became fun. And this is where I will record your sales. Very nice. And then will say something positive like "kudos" or "job well done. " Or zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah. - I can't tell if he's mocking me. - Just ignore him. Can't do that. It's really hard for me to let things go. I was. Mocking. Thank you. I just feel like we need something more to acknowledge when I make a sale. - Yes, like a chime or a bell. - Or a gong. Go to my car. Open the trunk. Inside, you will see many pelts. Under the smallest one is a case. Inside that case is a bear horn. Bring it to me. Yes! Isn't 7:00 P.M. a little late for a lunch party? Lunch party? It's supposed to say launch party. What is wrong with you? Angela is worse than usual lately, and we have a party to throw. So I googled "how to deal with difficult people," and I got all of this. So we're gonna try out some new things today. How do you feel about the fact that the banner says "lunch"? I feel angry. Angry at you. Angry at you for doing something stupid. Angry at me for believing you could do something not stupid. I'm so sorry to hear that. That must be awful. It is awful. You've made this day awful. Maybe you could just change the "u" into an "a". Then it would say "lanch" party, Kevin. Would it be better if it said "lanch" party? - Lunch party. - It's supposed to say "launch. " Easy, booster seat. Nobody cares about this party anyway. I care! Plan a party, Angela. Oh, and the entire world will see it. Oh! And here's $65 for your budget. And here are 4 idiots who'll do nothing but weigh you down. Oh, and your cat's still dead. - 20 seconds to go time. - Got it. Carb up. Really? Power gel? Hey, you wanna win, you gotta fuel like a winner. Okay. We start as soon as I make this shot. What would you say if I told you we could pull a prank on Dwight and at the same time not be working? What? - He goes through a breakup. - I'm aware of that. But he's also being super-annoying, and I'm not a perfect person. - You got one! - Three reams! In your face, machines! What kinda prank are you thinking? What if I told you I could offer free shipping? Sure, I'll hold. Who am I? You tell me. Not sure. Just became self-aware. So much to figure out. I think I'm programmed to be your enemy. I think it is my job to destroy you when it comes to selling paper. How do I know this isn't Jim? What is a Jim? It appears that the website has become alive. This happens to computers and robots sometimes. Am I scared of a stupid computer? Please! The computer should be scared of me. I have been salesman of the month for 13 out of the last 12 months. You heard me right. I did so well last february that corporate gave me two plaques in lieu of a pay raise. Yes, it's too tight. Way too tight. - Really? - This is why I'm here? Why is it so tight? It's a european cut. It just looks bad. What's hanging? - Setting up the web cam for the party. - Oh, good. Okay, cool. How many pounds I could lose by 7:00? Depends how much you've eaten already today. I had Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam. Just one second, we're in a meeting. I'll see if he's available. It's Jan. Why don't you wanna go tonight? What- All your friends will be there. My friends? Michael, I was terminated. Just. - Is it that important to you? - Yeah! - All right. - Thank you. Go by yourself. No- No. No. If I go by myself, everybody'll think I'm a big loser. - Well - I've your permission to invite Carol? - What? Jesus, Michael! - I'm sor- I'm sorry. It's just the first girl that popped into my head. I'll find somebody I haven't slept with. Nice! Website check, please. You, my friend, are winning handsomely. Oh, it just made another sale- You, my friend, are in a very close second. - 402. - Okay, why don't you just lay off? What you want me to do, not announce it? So, this is the dealio. God has smiled upon me and given me two tickets to the big party in New York tonight. What are you doing this evening? Look at that. They have their own little language now, like twins. - Sure, we'll go. - All right. Fight it out amongst yourselves. I was thinking Pammy, but boys' night out is also good. Oh, I'm sorry. What? - One of the tickets is for him. - Just let me know who the winner is. - Not it. I won. - Not it. Nope. Definitely not. If anything, it was a tie. Tie goes to the girlfriend. No, I realize you normally reorder in november, but what I'm suggesting- You did what? Oh! No! That's exactly what you're not supposed to do, damn it! Why reorder from a computer when you could have the personal touch of a salesman? - How's it going? - Fine. Good. - Yeah? - Yeah. - You look a little worried. - I do not look worried. You do look worried. "Here's a suggestion, computer. "I assume you read binary. "So why don't you 011-11-011-011?" Um, while you were typing that, I searched every database in existence and learned every fact about everything And mastered the violin. Oh, and sold more paper. I asked for assort cutlery, and I got back spoons. These are worthless. I want to understand what you're saying, but it's difficult for me when you use that tone. Phyllis, these are spoons. Spoons have round tops and are used to scoop things. What we need are forks which have prongs or tiny spears on top. And we need knives which have blades. Do you understand me now? Yes. Goody. - Hey. - What's up? - What's going on? - Paper delivery. - Oh, yeah? - Kelly ordered this online. What are you doing? I'm in the fight of my life against this computer, and every sale counts. But when you put paper in the shopping cart, it says, "Thanks for shopping with Dunder Mifflin. " Damn it, Kelly, it knows! It knows what you did! - Who knows? - Return it. Return it now. Hey How about instead of yelling at our sweet Miss Kapoor over 500 sheets of paper, you get back to your desk and start selling multiple reams, like a man. You don't understand. Okay, if this makes the difference, I'm gonna tell it that you were responsible. Who's "it"? - Here you go. - Thanks. You still missing Ryan? Not so much anymore. I am not a bad person. When I left Staples, I took some of their leads with me, but I never intended to use them. What did intend to do with them? Who knows? Maybe keep them as a souvenir. Maybe use them. Yes, Mr. Galliatto, how would you like to pay 10% less for paper than you're paying right now? It's not important how I got your information. What is important is that you say yes. - Good. - All right. I'm ready to go, and I'm calling shotgun. - I'm driving? - Yes, thank you. Let me just say good-bye to Pam. Oh, yeah, you better. You better say good-bye to Pam. Say good-bye to Pam. Good-Bye. I love you. I love you- Okay. I'm leaving inside Jim's car I don't know when I'll be back again Yes, I do Tomorrow I'll be back I'll be back tomorrow So you know what? Why don't you guys take off a little bit early tonight? Because there's a party. A party for the web site I've been planning for two weeks. If you are not this tall, you may not ride the roller coaster. - See you tomorrow. - Perfect. So let me just get some basic information from you. Oh. I didn't realize we could use the leads we stole from Staples. I'm sorry, so sorry. Yes, could you repeat that? Yes! Ten reams for the U.S. district court! Did I mention the 40 reams for the battered women's shelter? No! Stop it! Give me that! Give it! - Did you see the board? - There's still an hour. You ever read this? Yep. A long time ago, but I liked it. I got it for Ryan. I wanted to get him "Oh, the places you'll go," but they were sold out. It's the same sort of stuff in here. It's not, but it's a good book. What was that? Leaving Pennsylvania. Two kisses. - One for me, one for Jan. - Gotcha. You should come for dinner. You and Pam, that'd be fun. - That would be fun. - Wanna come over friday? - I can't. - After work, you guys- Oh, no, because- Let me know when we're close. Yes. Actually, I will tell you right now. It's a club called chat room, and there's a password to get in. Which is actually "password," so Okay. What are you doing? That is an invitation to an online party. No. I'm sure that's not- Are there three "Ws" at the beginning of the address? - Yes. - Yep. Well, the invitation says "VIPs only. " Is this how you treat your VIPs, Ryan? We're already in the city. The main part with the buildings. What am I supposed to do? What do you want me to do tonight? And if you tell me that I have to drive back to Scranton to the satellite party, I am going to throw up. Okay, I'm going to throw up. I'm throwing up. You're making me throw up, Ryan. You know that is is like? I will tell you. This is like when the freshmen would throw a party, and wouldn't let any of the seniors go. Doesn't it piss you off sometimes that little twerp got the promotion over us? Oh, actually I withdrew from consideration. Yeah, I withdrew too. Four, three, two, one! Yes! After numerous projections that the computer would crush all salesmen in its path, I am very happy to report that our very own Dwight Schrute has crushed his electronic nemesis, if you will, by a whopping 52 - reams! - Reams! Say it again- Announcing it. - 52 reams! - No, no, the first part. Dwight has defeated the computer! Hey. So What do you think? I did it for you. I didn't ask you to do it for me. You didn't have to. How do you tell someone it's over? You send them a notarized letter, right? Well, what if the recipient is your notary? - Hello, Pam. - Hello. Hey, do you have any men that you can fix me up with? I would like to have a relationship with a man. I'll get back to you. Let me know. You beat me. You are the superior being. All right, who wants to party? - Why aren't you in New York? - Oh-ho, what?! Oh, I think I faked Oscar out. You said you weren't coming back and we could leave early. I think I faked Stanley out too. Who else thought that I was leaving, and that he could go home early? Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha. Well, who needs New York? Right? We can have a killer party right here in Scranton. Thank you. No, no. It's gonna be nothing like the party you've been planning. This is going to be good. And everybody's gonna come. What's wrong with Dwight? - He beat the computer. - Oh, hey, good for you. Good for you. Scranton power! You know what? Angela, I'd like you to come into my office in ten minutes. Bring something to write with, and to write on. Good. It was a pretty disappointing day. It was kind of a slap in the face. To realize that I wasn't as important as I thought I was to a certain young executive Who I'd cared about. But you know, I'm not gonna cry over it. I did that in the car on the way home. - How we doing on time? - The party starts in an hour. Good, these are some things that I would like to have happen. "Beer, light beer, streamers, orchids, better lighting, something made of ice. " It's just things. This is how I want it to feel. "Pizza with mushrooms, pizza without mushrooms, white pi- " I would like this party to be sexier, cooler, more important- "Chocolates, someone famous, cool music, confetti, go-go dancers"? I want it to embarrass all other parties. I want it to be a party that the guys in New York watch on the web cam and say, "How did they get Al Roker to come?" - I can't do this. - Yes, you can. Yes, you can. I know you can. I wouldn't say that if I didn't 100% believe it. Who else could do this? - Okay. Okay. - No, seriously. Anyone else could do it better? Because we don't have a lot of time. I'll get the pizza. What do you think of Angela? I think she's efficient. No, not like that. As a woman. W- O-M-A-N I hadn't noticed. You hadn't noticed she's a woman? I hear she's single and ready to mingle. I'm thinking about making a play for her. What do you think? Crazy, right? I think it's inappropriate to date someone you work with. - Isn't that part of the fun? - No. I think you should date Kelly. She works here too. How is that any different? She works in the annex. You're also welcome to date Toby. Okay. - Good news. - We get to go home? Guess who just ordered from your favorite pizza place, Alfredo? Wait Alfredo's pizza cafe Or pizza by Alfredo? - Same thing. - No. I don't understand when you all talk at the same time! Oscar, talk to him. Michael, there's a very big difference between these two pizza places. Both in quality of ingredients and in overall taste. Which one did you order from? Pizza by Alfredo. All right, you know what? Okay, okay. What is better, a medium amount of good pizza, or all you can eat of pretty good pizza? A medium amount of good pizza. Oh, no, it's bad. It's real bad. It's like eating a hot circle of garbage. You can pick one of these things. It's unreasonable for you to ask me to do all of this. It should take you no time if you put the care into it that you normally do. That seemed to shut her up. You looking for dinner and a movie? You're not gonna find it in that box. It just so happens I know where you can find it, but again Not in the box. Angela, are you hearing words that I'm saying? What? Hello. I worked on a party for 3 weeks that just got thrown out the window. So now I've to organize a whole new party. And my useless number two quit, so now there's no one in charge of orchids, chocolates, or the ice made thing. And my upper back itched all day, and I can't reach it. And Kevin had greek food for lunch again. They say you should never mix business with pleasure. Really? Well then explain to me how a putt-putt golf company operates. - Yep. - The Pizza by Alfredo guy is here. - You don't have to say it like that. - I said it normal. - Hey. - Hey. Uh, $63.50, and that's not including tip. Right, I've a coupon, so half of $63.50, and half the tip on $63.50 Half-off coupons only apply to orders of two pizzas. No, I told them on phone I was ordering eight pizzas. I don't care what you told them on the phone. That's our policy. You didn't think that I was gonna spend 60 bucks on pizza? It's not pizza. It doesn't say it anywhere on the coupon, and if it's your policy, it should say it on the coupon. What do you mean? - Not my problem. - It is your problem. That's no way to do business, okay? I ordered eight pizzas with a half-off coupon, so I would like eight pizzas for half off, end of story. Great story. - $63.50, and that's not including tip. - I'm not giving that to you. Then, you're not getting your pizzas. No, no, you're not- You are not going anywhere. You're going to stay here until we figure this out. - What? - You know what? This young man needs to learn that that's not how you treat people. I don't care if it's pizza. Good business is about respect and accountability and follow-through. You don't just make promises and pull the rug out from under somebody, do you? Dwight, please escort this young man into the conference room. Right now. - I'm not going in there. - Yeah, you are. And you'll come out when you decide to give me a discount. Please. Thank you. This is stupid. No, you don't even know what stupid is! It's about to get all stupid up in here! You find anything? We think it's a straight forward kidnapping. Stanley, could you look up "accomplices?" Why can't you guys do it? Because we're looking up "jail time. " Fine. I've seen this kid, he sneaks onto my farm and steals my hemp. Yeah, I know that guy. He's that farmer that grows really crappy weed. - You ready to give me my discount now? - No. What have you done in here this whole time? - What kind of business is this? - A paper company. The best paper company in the whole wide world! Dwight, knock it off. You'd better think about what you're doing. Think about what you're doing. No. I'm an adult. I don't have to think or do anything. You're a kid. You're a little snot-nose punk kid who thinks he's better than everybody else. Because he's some hotshot. And you don't know anything about sales. So stop being a disrespectful little jerk, okay? - Sales? - Yeah, sales. You sell pizza. - That's called sales. - You're such a loser. - What did you call him? - A loser. - What did you say?! - A loser. Okay, stop it. Stop it! Stop getting him to say it! - You just made this worse. A lot worse. - I can make him talk. We are accomplices. Stop talking all at once! - You need to let him go. - Let go of little jerk boy? Before he has learned his lesson? - Yes. - You know what, Jim? World would be a better place if people were held accountable for their actions. Yes, but not by kidnapping them. I'm not kidnapping him. I'm keeping him until I get what I want. As a hostage. - You over-think it. - You under-think it. Yes, is Alfredo there? May I speak to manager then? Okay, could you tell the manager that I am keeping his delivery kid until I get my discount on the eight pizzas I ordered? Yes, I know it is not on the coupon. Also, I would like him to throw in two- three pizzas just for our - Ransom. - trouble. Okay. All right. - What'd he say? - He said no. - So we should let him go. - No, no. Listen up, kid. I don't like you, but because some town in Switzerland says so, you have rights. I have to hang these. Why are you looking at her like that? Hey! What's going on? Michael called the pizza place with demands. Mr. Overdramatic. What's up, Kev? We're getting hungry out there. We're all accomplices now anyway, so we figured we might as well eat. We would like to order some good pizza from Alfredo's pizza cafe while we wait for the hostage situation with the bad pizza to end. I needed another hour. It could have been done in another hour. I think it looks good. That's why you're not in charge, Meredith. Here you are, my dear. One thing made of ice. How did you Where- Where did you It's just ice. It'll melt all over the floor. - Will you help me put it over there? - Yes, I will. Excuse me. I stole it. Thank god. Ryan wants to introduce the branch managers in a few minutes. You just have to wave and introduce yourself. I'll just wave and introduce myself. - Quick question. - Yeah. If I take a pizza, do you think you could take some sodas and some napkins up to the roof? - I'm all over it. - Okay. What do we got here? - Good pizza. - Yeah? - Cheese, or do we have other flavors? - Different stuff. Which one's this? Perfect. Do you remember what you said to me on my first day at work, just before you walked me over to my desk? "Enjoy this moment, because you're never going to go back to this time "before you met your desk-mate Dwight. " And that's when I knew. You? You came up to my desk and you said, "This might sound weird, "and there's no reason for me to know this, "but that mixed berry yogurt you're about to eat has expired. " That was the moment that you knew you liked me? Yep. - Can we make it a different moment? - Nope. Can I start talking? Is this thing on? Give me a signal when you want me to start. And now, from my old hometown, Scranton, Pennsylvania, my former boss, Michael Scott. I just think you should know that one of my salesmen beat your stupid computer. So take that, asshole. Always a jokester. How about that image? Crystal clear. If anyone out there is listening, I'm being held here against my will. I'm a minor. What are you doing? You said your upper back itched. - I didn't ask you to scratch it. - Angela, I know this is weird because we work together, and because up until and possibly including now, I've repulsed you. - But I like you. - I'm not dating you. So Angela is stubborn as a mule. She's giving off fairly strong vibes that she's not interested. But do I like her or not? Because if I like her, then I can't back down. If you're going number one, you've got ten more seconds! Hey, have you seen Jim? I guess he wanted get out of here before the cops find out. What are you doing? Scaring him. The trick is to make him think you're gonna do something to him. - I can hear you, man. - Shut up! Or I punch you in the throat! Stop it! Stop it! No. God. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. I kidnapped a kid. You had to. What other choice did you have? I've gotta pay for the pizza. Well Yeah. Oh, my god. - This is Michael. - Hello, Michael, this is Ryan. - First off, thanks for the shout-out. - You're breaking up. I can't hear you. Why's there a kid on your web cam saying that he's being held against his I want you to go in there and pay him for the pizzas, and give him a generous tip. No more than 10%. - What will you do? - I will open the door. - Yeah? - And hopefully, he will walk out. And the rest is out of our hands. So I'm paying full price? Yes. Here we go. $65. You know what? Here's two more. See ya. Drive safely. Okay. Now what? Now we wait and hope that nothing happens. All right. I assume I'm going to be reimbursed? Not now, Dwight, please. Not the time. A toast. Better make it good. To avoiding a class 2 felony charge. Hello? Hey. Hang on a second. Hello? Hang on. If you change your mind I'll be first in line Honey, I'm still free Take a chance on me If you need me let me know Gonna be around If you got no place to go If you're feeling down If you're all alone When the pretty birds have flown Honey, I'm still free Take a chance on me Gonna do my very best And that ain't no lie If you put me to the test If you let me try Take a chance on me That's all I ask of you, Angela. - Hey, how'd it go? - Yeah, what'd she say? I don't know yet. I've to call you back. - You gotta give us- - I'll call you back! I have to go clean up after the party. What a horrible day. Well, I need to get the horrible taste of this pizza out of my mouth. I'd really like some sushi. I was hoping that I would have New York-style sushi today. And you know what? - What? - I'm gonna get it. Cooper says calamari. There's only one place to get New York-style sushi. - Tokyo? - New York. You wanna go? - Yes! - All right, you drive. Okay! - Nice! - Here we go. I'm sorry- You guys are gonna have to leave. Hey, you know what? Come on. Come on. Let's go! Hey, you're the Scranton guy. - Guilty. - I liked your statement tonight. Okay. Thanks. This is the guy that beat the computer. Oh, very cool. It was funny to see Ryan all embarrassed by that. Yeah. See you later. Later on. I'm Ryan, and tonight didn't go the way that I thought it would. Because it didn't work out for me. I'm very embarrassed. I have egg all over my face. And I'm 12 years old. I spent so much time in Scranton, but I never sold any paper. I never sold any paper, because I'm an idiot. I started a fire with my cheese peeler. And dated an indian girl. I started a fire. Now I got a beard. And I have new shoes and I'm your boss. I'm hot. I'm so hot. - That- That's why everybody- - I don't get- I don't understand that. That's part of it. It's just Wanna head back? Yeah, let's go. Coat! Michael just rent The Devil wears Prada. He has his netflix sent here to the office and he watches them in pieces when things are slow. Steak! Where's my steak? He's a big Meryl Streep fan, so I shouldn't be surprised that he's identified with her character. Get me Armani. A suit? On the phone. The main company number? 'Cause I'm gonna have to Where's Armani? He's on the phone. Too slow. You're not going to Paris. I'm so much better than you are. I owe you an apology. - You finished the movie. - Yeah, it was awesome. Big surprise ending. Won't ruin it for you. No, go ahead. Meryl Streep is the bad guy. You never see it coming. Anyway, if I was mean in any way to you, I'm sorry. I just want what's best for you, Minushka. Macushla. He's watching Million Dollar Baby. He's gonna try to kill me.

People said I have very pretty eyes. - You do. - I haven't heard the same about you. So let's just go with mine. Well they both go with the carpet that I've ordered. And if we go with the brown leather sofas, they go with that too. - We already have a sofa, so why d - A futon's not a sofa. It folds up. You've only seen it flat. - I know what a futon is, Michael. - I Okay. How much is it gonna cost? - It costs what it costs. - No - It doesn't even mean anything. - We've gone through this. Yes! Money has been a little bit tight lately. But at the end of my life, when I'm sitting on my yacht, am I gonna be thinking about how much money I have? No, I'm gonna be thinking about how many friends I have and my children and my comedy albums. I mean, I have a yacht, so I obviously did pretty well, money-wise. It's just, you know, you say it's gonna cost what - Yeah? - Michael, it's Ryan for you. Conniving little runt Put him through. Put him through. Yes? Ryan, my man! - I email you about the new Powerpoint. - Yes, thanks for sending that to me. I had I.T. install the updated Powerpoint on your computer so you can use it for the presentation. I really want people use Powerpoint. Okay, yeah. No, I don't know. I don't know. I think those I.T. guys messed up. - Hold on, I get them on the phone. - Wait, no, here it is Found it. Sure, I can hold. Dunder Mifflin, Dwight Schrute. Please hold. Schrute farms. Guttentag. How can help you? Yes, we have availability on those nights. How many in your party? Oh, no, I'm sorry. No king beds. No queen either. We make our own mattresses that don't conform to the traditional sizes. Closest would be twin. Thank you so much for calling. Call back again. Auf wiedersehen. - Hey Dwight. - None of your business, Jim. - You running a bed and breakfast? - It's not a B &amp; B. Agro-tourism is a lot more than a bed and breakfast. It consists of tourists coming to a farm, showing them around, giving them a bed, giving them breakfast. - Department of Health know about this? - I am not telling you anything. Permits are pending. Dwight Schrute, Dunder Mifflin. - I'm looking for a room. - Okay, this is a misuse of company phones. It says here you cater to the elderly. - Where did you read that? - Trip Advisor. Trip Advisor is the lifeblood of the agro-tourism industry. A couple of bad reviews there, you may as well close up shop. That's what took down the Stalk Inn, one of the cutest little asparagus farms you'll ever see. How many in your party? Two. We offer our tours of the fields and of the barn. Perhaps you'd be interested in Mose's table-making demonstration. So, I forgot to tell you that I need the car tonight. Actually, I need the car. Why? For improv? Why don't you just pretend that you have a car? Good practice in case you ever do a scene where you need to pretend you have a car. Used to have two cars. Tred 'em in. Now we're down to one. Good economic sense. Although the new car's a Porsche For her. One cardigan. One sleeping cardigan. One sleep apnea mask. What about my cherub figurine? You took that with you. No, I left it on my night tab Your night table by the lamp. You are incorrect. I was recently scrubbing my room of memories and I didn't see it there. Fine. My girlfriend and I broke up recently and I must say I am relieved. Gives me a chance to sow my wild oats. In the Schrute family, we have a tradition where when the male has sex with another woman he is rewarded with a bag of wild oats left on his doorstep by his parents. You can use those oats to make oatmeal, bread Whatever you want. I don't care, they're your oats. The bar uses an applause meter. That is why it is so important that you all come and applaud only for my band, Scrantonicity 2. Not Scrantonicity, which I am no longer a part of. - Michael, can I count on you? - You cannot, I have a thing tonight. Damn it. - What? - That reminds me. If the invitation still stands, Pam and I would love to have dinner tonight. Oh, no. I've a thing tonight. - That stinks. - Darn it. Shoot. - How about this weekend? - No, can't. We only had tonight free and we really wanted to spend it with you. Damn it to hell! - All right. - What do you got going on tonight? You wouldn't understand. It's a secret. I wouldn't understand or it's a secret? You wouldn't understand, Jim. It's a secret. I'm sorry, Mr. O'Brien. I didn't mean to interrupt your dinner. I just have a very exciting offer. My records indicate you've expressed interest in losing some weight. What if I told you that I have a pill that will make you 50 pounds lighter in five minutes? How would that sound? Amazing, right? Well, it won't be that fast but it will It will be that easy. I can't believe this place is real. I'd heard about his beet farm for years, - but I never thought - The beets motel. The beets motel? - That is - Thank you. Borscht Hotel. The Embassy Beets. Radish Inn. - How are you doing this? - I don't know. Oh, my gosh. I just love sales. I love it to death. It's as simple as that. And I don't get to do enough of it as a manager, so I took this second job, kind of as a hobby. Some people have golf or relaxing. - What's going on here? - Hey, I just got off the phone and I was gonna make another call. We're a legit operation with a license from the city. I can show you. We pay minimum wage against commission. They're with me, so This is Nick Figaro, manager to the stars. We have three rooms, each with a different theme. What are the themes? America, irrigation, and night time. - Irrigation. - Yes. I'll put you down for irrigation. Now then, do you have any special needs or dietary restrictions? Yes, we will be requiring a bedtime story. No. - Not even Harry Potter? - Jim, come on. - But you promised. - Mose, bags, now. Here we are, irrigation room. A very special room. So I'll come get you before the table-making demonstration. And as of this morning, we're completely wireless here at Schrute farms. But as soon as I find out where Mose hid all the wires, we'll get that power back on. All righty. Everybody in the conference room in five minutes. These meetings are useless. I just want to remind you to stick to the script. Been proven to work. So make the call, say the lines, make the sale. Got it? Very inspirational. We're offering a $50 bonus tonight to the guy with the most sales, okay? - Or woman. - Or a trained seal. You can make jokes when you've made a sale there, rookie. Okay? I'd say one in six. What? I thought you asked me what are chances were of being murdered here tonight. You know, I just realized this is Pam's and my first night away together. I used to play it over in my head and it was just a little bit different. Maybe a nice hotel or a romantic dinner. Wine but wine that wasn't made out of beets. Didn't think Dwight would be involved at all. And I always imagined less manure. I mean, some manure. Just less. This is beet food. Mose, what are you doing? No, Mose! Put the Put the manure down. Put it down. Do not throw it! Do not Yes, is Mr. Hudson there? Yeah, who is this? Well I'm just calling because you responded positively to Stanley? Why are you calling me here at home? Señor, are you happy with your long distance, sir? Michael, I know that's you. Why are you calling me here at home? Have you con Have you considered satellite television? Michael, I know that's you. I know your voice. - All right. - Why are you calling me here at home? When I'm at home at night in my own house in my sweats, drinking some red wine, watching my mystery stories, the last thing in the whole godforsaken world I want to hear is the voice of Michael scott. Your son sounds like he's really motivated. I think it's crazy that the coach won't play him, frankly. My office. You bet. Just dial the number on the sheet and stick to the script. Say the words exactly. Got it? I don't know why we keep having this conversation. Look, I know sales and I had that sale. I just needed a few more minutes. A few more minutes is a waste of our time! - It's not a waste of time. - It's a trading game. You give a quick pitch. You make the sale and move on. - That's how Vikram does. - He doesn't have my people skills. Good for Vikram 'cause he out-sells you every night. Well, I hope this conversation has helped. "And Harry saw "the white hand raise its wand "and felt Voldemort's surge "of vicious anger. "Saw the frail old man on the floor "writhe in agony. "Harry. "It was over as quickly as it had come. "Harry stood shaking in the darkness, "clutching the gate into the garden, "his heart racing." What did you get tonight? Oh, it looks like mixed marsala, eggplant, and rice. Oh, that looks good. And what about you? A peanut butter flavor again? I am going with the vanilla crisp this evening. - Enjoy. - Thank you. I was a surgeon back home. - Really? - Yeah. - Wonder what I would've been back home. - This is your home. I know, but I mean, it's so competitive here. What's the dollar worth in your land? Medical school must've cost, like, 40 bucks or a donkey or something. No. I would've been chief of surgery. Or a cowboy. - Wait, you're going out there? - Yeah. Coward. Oh, my god! What century is this? Here's the thing about Die Hard 4. Die Hard 1, the original, John McClain is just this normal guy, you know? He's just a normal New York city cop who gets his feet cut, he gets beat up. But he's an everyday guy. In Die Hard 4, he is jumping a motorcycle into a helicopter in the air. You know? He's invincible. It's just sort of lost from Die Hard 1. It's not Terminator. Dude, you should review movies. Oh, my god, yes! - Yeah, you should! - I actually wrote a movie. - Really? - Well I'm writing one. - What's it about? - Sort of spy thriller. Hey, what's so captivating? I love captivating things. And this must really be captivating because it's keeping you off the phones. I mean, time is your money. That's how I know how captivating it is because of how much time you've spent talking. He returned. Come in. Did you have another nightmare? - I thought you were Mose. - Does Mose have nightmares? Oh, yes. Ever since the storm. Is everything satisfactory with your stay? Yeah. - Yep. - Great. Just that I'd heard crying or moaning or something in here. Well I'll look into that in the morning. Thank you for bringing that to the attention of the staff. Good night, Dwight. Hey, so we're all gonna go out for a beer. - You wanna come? - We'd love for you to come. Thanks, no. I've to work in the morning, so - All right, next time. - Okay. See you guys. Hey, how are you doing? You drive. I had too much wine. Okay. - How was yoga? - I didn't go. - Why? Why not? - I just didn't. How was improv? - Good night, Vikram. - Night. - Congrats on the bonus. - Thank you, Michael. I'll nab it one of these nights. If you concentrate and make your calls faster, yeah. - Good night. - Good night. - Morning. - Hi. Hey Dwight, how are you? Pam. You okay? I'm better than you have ever been or ever will be. Hey guys what's happening? How's my favorite branch doing? Michael, why don't you start us off. That wasn't much of an introduction. Ladies and gentlemen, your boss Michael scott. Still lame. Okay. All right Thank you, Ryan, for that wonderful introduction. Okay Today, we're going to be talking about Powerpoint. Powerpoint, Powerpoint, Powerpoint. Yes, I forgot about Ryan's presentation and yes, it would have been nice to do well with the first presentation that he'd given me. But you know what else would've been nice? Winning the lottery. And the best way to start is to hit "start". And up comes the tool bar. That's what she said. What we have to do here is go to "run". And then, you look up to Powerpoint and we are in. We are going to register. You hit "register". "Updates are ready." I should update. "Estimated time 12 minutes." So it should take about 5 or 7 minutes. Is this the first time you've opened Powerpoint? Why? You didn't prepare it, did you? Know what? I had really rough night. And my boss can back me up on that. - I'm your boss. - My other boss, Mr. Figaro. You've another job? What I do beetween 5:30 pm and 1:00 am is nobody's business but mine and my other businesses. Are you a cocktail waitress? You cannot have a second job - if it affects your work here. - It won't. - It did already. - Okay. Honestly, it is unlikely that I was gonna figure this out anyway. - You're so funny. - Why is Darryl here? - He works in the warehouse. - I invited him. It's not a party. Darryl, downstairs, this isn't information you need. This information here? Yeah, you're right. I don't need this. Hey, come on. - See you later tonight. - I got plans later. Okay, bye honey. How long to get this presentation ready? Why don't you do the presentation? - I mean, you know how to do it. - What I really want honestly, is for you to know it so that you can communicate to the people here, to your clients, to whomever. What? - It's whoever, not whomever. - No, it's whomever. No, whomever is never actually right. Well, sometimes it's right. Michael is right. It's a made-up word used to trick students. No, actually whomever is the formal version of the word. Obviously, it's a real word, but I don't know when to use it correctly. - Not a native speaker. - I know what's right. But I'm not gonna say because you're all jerks who didn't come see my band last night. - You know the correct one? - I don't know. It's whom when it's the object of the sentence, and who when it's the subject. - That sounds right. - It sounds, but is it? - Ryan use it as an object? - As an object. Ryan used me as an object. - Is he right about that? - How did he use it again? It was Ryan wanted Michael, the subject, to explain the computer system, the object. - Thank you. - To whomever, meaning us, the indirect object, which is the correct use of the word. No one asked you anything ever, so whomever's name is Toby, why don't you take a letter opener and stick it into your skull. Hey, this doesn't matter. And I don't even care. Michael, you quit the other job or you're fired here. I've never done this before. I've never quit anything in my life, so You are filming history. Nick, I had a dream last night that I had two full-time jobs. One here at the lipaphadrazone diet pill company. - Lipaphedrine. - The other, I was regional manager of a small paper supply company called Dunder Mifflin. - Never heard of it. - In this dream, I did both of these jobs beautifully. And I loved it. And everybody loved me. The truth is - I can't do this. - Are you quitting? I am. Come back anytime. Don't forget to disinfect your headset. I was never in this for the money. But it turns out that the money was an absolute necessity for me. I tried to live the dream. I trieto have a job, a girlfriend, another job, and I failed. But the good thing about the American Dream is that you can just go to sleep. And try it all again the next night. So What's up? Me, all night, dreaming about Angela's smoking hot body. - You're being gross. - Not from a male perspective. You need to set me up with her. I know she told you she's looking and she's totally not responding my moves. What moves? I've moonwalked past accounting, like, ten times. - Can't believe it's not working. - Yeah. I don't know if I really see you two together. Really? Well maybe you should look in the small part on your brain. - She's very religious. - Okay, well I come from a line of W.A.S.P.S. so long it leads back to Moses. Okay, well she takes her convictions pretty seriously. She could be kind of severe. Yeah, and I punched a hole in a wall. - That's right, you did. - Yeah. Now that I think about it, Angela and Andy might actually make a good couple. But I couldn't do that to Dwight or Angela or Andy. Hey Kevin, you're a gambler, right? A rounder. You play the ponies, tall horses. I do gamble, Michael. I was thinking about doing some gambling myself. You know, just a little bit of money. Maybe doubling it and then doubling it, several more times. I don't know. Kind of just for fun. I was thinking Do you have any tips or ideas about sure things? Like a boxer who is gonna throw the big fight, you know, like he's tied in to some crooked dealings and maybe his kid is sick or something. Like, who do I call about that? The mob. Do you know anybody in the mob? Okay. Oscar I'm gonna need another advance on my salary. - What do you mean you've plans tonight? - I have my daughter tonight. We're renting Charlotte's Web. Well you have to make a choice. - It's either your daughter or me. - My daughter. Okay. I see how it is. That was cold. He's always been terrible with money. I bet it's Jan spending him straight to the poorhouse. Yeah, women be shoppin'. I can't believe he has a second job. - He's not even good at his first one. - Hey guys. Whatcha talking about? Okay, I know what's going on. Talking about Jim and Pam. If they're having sex, what it looks like I know. Michael, are you having money problems? Monkey problems? No, I'm not having monkey problems. Why would I have monkey problems? - I know you heard me correctly. - Oh, I hate monkeys. What's going on? Why do you have a second job? I don't have a second job. Maybe I am having an affair with Suzanne Sommers. - Jan has no money? - I don't talk to my girlfriend about money. It's rude and unsexual. True, it's best to hide our money problems from women. I totally agree with you. But I don't have money problems. All right, you know what? Watch this. If I had money problems, would I do this? - You just put it back in your pocket. - Yeah. Yeah, but I destroyed it. It's not even usable anymore. Hey, let's call this what it is. It's like she only wants to hook up when Ryan comes around. It's gotten to the point where I get excited everytime I see that little dude walk through the door. Well I just need to know where this is going. Hey, I like you. All right? Why's not to like? But you need to access your uncrazy side. Otherwise maybe this thing has run its course. Don't you dare walk away from me, Darryl Philbin. You're the most selfish person I've ever met Slow down. Think it over. Darryl Philbin is the most complicated man that I've ever met. I mean, who says exactly what they're thinking. What kind of game is that? Hey, cuz. - Heard you're having money problems. - No, you didn't. Listen, I got the answer. You declare bankruptcy, all your problems away. Creed Bratton has never declared bankruptcy. When Creed Bratton gets in trouble, he transfers his debt to William Charles Schneider. How would that help, Creed? In monopoly, you go bankrupt, you lose. You don't go by monoly, man. That game is nuts. Nobody just picks up "Get out of jail free" cards. Those things cost thousands. That is a good point. Bankruptcy, Michael, is nature's do-over. It's a fresh start. It's a clean slate. Like the witness protection program. - Exactly. - Not at all! I've always wanted to be in the witness protection program. Fresh start. No debts, no bagage. I've already got my name picked up: "Lord Rupert Everton." I'm a, uh, shipping merchant who raises fancy dogs. That's the life. I declare bankruptcy! Hey, I just wanted you to know that you can't just say the word "bankruptcy" and expect anything to happen. - I didn't say it, I declared it. - Still That's That's not anything. This is a lot of credit card debt. Yeah, tell about it. You know, Jan has my credit cards and she's using 'em as if I'm made of money. She thinks I'm a human ATM machine. Okay. $125, Amazon. Oh, Best of the Muppet Show on DVD. Classic. $1200. What's a "Core-Blaster Extreme"? That is by far, the best way to strengthen your core. This machine You sit on a stabilizer ball. You put your feet into the power stirrups, you reach up and you grab onto the super rod. And you twist and you twist and you twist. It strengthens your entire core. Your back core, your arm core, your The marine corps actually uses it. I think that's how they got "corps." I left a little present for Angela. I think she's going to like it 'cause I found it outside vance refrigeration all alone. And I told her in the note that the cat came to find her. That they were destined to be together. I got game. Okay, the green bar is what you spend every month on stuff you need. Like a car or a house. That is so cool how you have my name at the top. The red bar is what you spend on non-essentials, like magazines, entertainments, things like that. This scary black bar is what you spend on things that no one ever, ever needs, like multiple magic sets, professional bass fishing equipment. How do you do this so fast? Is this Powerpoint? Oh, man. Angela really had a hold on him. Angela. Michael, I'm gonna set you and Jan up with a debt consolidator. - You meet with this guy - No. We're leaving Jan out of this. - She has to know. - We will find another way. We'll ask Powerpoint. Michael, this is a presentation tool. You're a presentation tool, if you think I'm gonna tell Jan about this. - I'm done. - No, you're not Just You're not a tool. Look, I'll tell her that it's bad. But it could've been a lot worse but due to some fancy financial footwork I was able to cut it in half. Jan is smart. She poses. Dwight, how's the hotel business? Stupid. You checked Trip Advisor recently? No Maybe you should. Maybe you should Whatever. We wrote a good review. Under comments, we wrote: "The natural aroma of the beets "drifts into the bedrooms and makes you dream of simpler times." "The dawn goose walk will tug at your artstrings." "Table-making never seemed so possible." "You will never want to leave your room." "The architecture reminds one of a quaint Tuscan beetfarm." I'm glad you enjoyed your stay. We really did. It was fun. So due to Michael's clever financial maneuvering, he finds himself tremendously in debt. You're bro? How did you get that from what Oscar's saying? That's not I mean Michael, how did this happen? Where exactly did your money go? I I don't I don't get this. I really don't. I don't I don't understand how you could be so irresponsible. I mean It is astounding to me, really. - I don't know what more to say - Jan? - Yeah, what? - Michael left. - Okay, where did he go? - I don't know. Well is he coming right back? I don't think so. I'll be right there. What am I doing? I'm blowing dodge. I'm getting out of town. Whatever you'll call it. I'm running away from my responsibilies. And it feels good. You may ask me out to dinner. Nothing fancy or foreign. No bars, no patios, no vegetables. And no seafood. Dwight. Did I ever tell you why I left Scranton? Yeah, I didn't think I had. Well It was all about Pam. Yeah, I mean she was with Roy, and I just couldn't take it. I mean, I lost it, Dwight. I couldn't sleep, I couldn't concentrate on anything. And then weird stuff, like, food had no taste. So my solution was to move away. It was awful. And it is something that I would wish on my worst enemy. And that includes you. Hey, I was thinking about dinner Dinner Let's see, maybe we should try the new italian place where was the dry cleaner. - Okay. - Yeah? Yeah. Okay. Jim's just really passionate about italian food. Yeah, I'm very passionate about italian food. In fact I'm in love with italian food. - Jan, he went running that way - Okay, great. Thanks. Runaway train never coming back Runaway and I'm never coming back Michael? Hey, Jan. What's going on? Not much. - What's up with you? - Why are you sitting on a train? - Where are you going? - I'm out of answers, Jan. What does that mean? I told you, no more answers. This is who I am now. A guy on a train with no answers. I hope that can be enough for you. Michael, come on. Running away from your problems won't solve anything, you know that. - I don't know that. - Creditors can follow you anywhere with ease. Your debt follows you around the world. - Electronically. - I'll stay off the grid. Michael, come on. Come on, you can deal with this. It's not that bad. Yeah, it is. It is. I really messed up. Well When When my life fell apart and they And they screwed me in New York and I felt like my whole world was collapsing around me, I didn't have anyone. I mean, my whole family still won't even talk me on the advice of council and my friends were just waiting for this to happen. - That's really nice of you to say. - Michael, no. What I want to say is you were there for me. By my side. Without even a thought. That's just who you are. I mean No matter how badly I treat you or what l'm going through you just You are there for me. And that is a guy worth staying beside. So where's this train taking us? I don't I think the engineer left. Hello, this is Dwight Schrute calling from Dunder Mifflin, and according to our records, you appear to be low on office supplies. Okay, sure, I can take care of that right now. Don't sell your implants, please. I'm keeping them. I know you like them. - They're kind of uncomfortable though. - It's nice though. - My nipples aren't as sensitive now. - Looks cute though. Yeah, everything! It's all good! Phyllis. - Dancing babies! - Dancing babies. I love it! We are making a commercial for Dunder Mifflin today. Our first ad ever. Corporate purchased some airtime in local markets to spread the word about Dunder Mifflin Infinity, and they are even sending up a professional ad company to help us make it later, so it's not too shabby. Best ad ever?   Gimme a break     Gimme a break     Break me off a piece of that   I am totally blanking. What is the thing? - Nobody tell him! - What? No Why? You got it. You're so close.   Break me off a piece of that     Bre apple sauce   Break me off a piece of that apple sauce. I don't think   piece of that chrysler car   - Nope. -   football cream   Okay. Football cream. It's football cream. All right, so anybody else? I'm taking a computer animation class, so I could try to do a logo. Look at that. Even the receptionist is getting in on the creativity. Very good. Hello, hello. - How you doing? - Michael Scott, regional manager. - Nice to meet you. Us too, man. - Excited to talk ideas. You know what? I want this to be cutting edge. I want it to be fast, quick cuts, you know? Youthful, sort of a MTV on crack kind of thing. - That sounds great. - All right. This is what we have to work with. I would like you to meet Andrew Bernard. The 'nard dog. Who let the 'nard dog out? He gives the best back rubs in the office. That's true. I give a mean back rub. I also do good aromatherapy. Not! You just got 'nard dogged! Now this gentleman right here is the key to our - urban vibe. - Urban? I grew up in a small town. What about me seems urban to you? Stanley's hilarious. Phyllis is like our Mrs. Butterworth. Kind of a less urban aunt Jemima. These are our accountants. And as you can see, they are very different sizes. What you might wanna do is kind of a papa bear, mama bear, baby bear thing. - That might be kind of fun. - Mama bear. Who else? I think it's great that the company's making a commercial. Because not very many people have heard of us. When I tell people that I work at Dunder Mifflin, they think that we sell mufflers, or muffins, or mittens, or And frankly, all of those sound better than paper, so I let it slide. Episode 4x05 "LOCAL AD" - You playing that game again? - Second life is not a game. It is a multi-user virtual environment. It doesn't have points or scores. It doesn't have winners or losers. Oh, it has losers. I signed up for Second Life about a year ago. Back then my life was so great that I literally wanted a second one. In my second life, I was also a paper salesman, and I was also named Dwight. Absolutely everything was the same, except I could fly. Little girl in a field holding a flower. We zoom back to find that she's in the desert, and the field is an oasis. We zoom back further. The desert is a sandbox in the world's largest resort hotel. Zoom back further. The hotel is actually the playground of the world's largest prison. - Zoom back further - Okay. I can tell your time's valuable. Actually I don't get paid by the hour anymore, but thank you. I get paid by the year, so That all sounds really ambitious. Yeah, I know. Why don't we show you what we did with the national branch. Okay. That's what national came up with? That sucks! That's what we came up with. We can do better than that. The main part of the ad must stay the same, actually. Yeah, it's the last five seconds where we've some leeway. The waving? Well no. You won't be waving. That was just what they did. You guys can be clapping, sitting. Standing outside, inside, whatever. I mean, this is where you really get to be creative. I need some advice. Been spending a lot of time making out with Angela lately. We've been necking, but only necking, right? Not actually kissing our mouths. Just a neck on neck. It's just like rubbing/nuzzling our necks together. It's hot, I'm not gonna lie to you. But it's a little weird. But you seem like a guy with answers. So how do I fast-track this, get to first base? We cannot talk about this, because someone might hear us. We'll use code names. Angela can stay the same, but we'll change Andy to Dwight. That's not different enough. Dwike? You have a call from Eddie Murphy. Hello? Shrek! Shrek, I'm a donkey! I'm a donkey, Shrek! I'm just kidding. It's me. Hello, Ry. - What? - Okay, calm down. I just have a small problem. I told you not to call about small problems. Well when I call about big problems, you don't like that either, so make up your mind, kiddo. Here is the deal. The ad guys that you sent are locking me in a creative box and sort of ignoring my ideas. That's good. They're creative, you're not. I'm creative, Ryan. It's not part of your job. It's like, maybe you can cook, but that doesn't mean you should start a restaurant. Well, actually I can't cook, and I'm starting a restaurant. "Mike's Cereal Shack. " I'm thinking we'll have as many varieties as you can buy in the store. I'm not really interested in that right now. I'm delegating creativity to creative professionals. It's a different skill set. Look, I wasn't good at sales, right? But I'm good - at managing people who do sales. - Are you? I don't think you're doing such a great job here, suppressing ideas and creativity. All right, let me ask you this. Tell me if you think this is creative. When I was five, I imagined that there was such a thing as a unicorn. And this is before I had even heard of one or seen one. I just drew a picture of a horse that could fly over rainbows and had a huge spike in its head. I was five. Five years old. Couldn't even talk yet. Hey, guys. You know what? We cannot shoot this ad today. - Okay, when should we come back? - How about never hundred hours, sir? - Wait, we were sent here to he - I'm not gonna argue with this guy. Let's go. Good luck, dude. - Hey thanks. Thank you. - Thank you. Michael, David Wallace. What is this about dismissing the ad people? Yeah, I'm glad you called. Ryan is being a little bitch again. - I'm on, Michael. - What's up, my brother? Listen, David. I would like to do this ad in house. I want to use only the creativity that we have right here in the office. And I will send it to you tomorrow morning. Take a look at it. If you don't think it's ready to air, send the ad agency back down here and we'll do it on my dime. This is weird. I'm willing to stake my entire reputation on it. Okay. I'll see it tomorrow. - Okay. - Okay. And thus Michael Scott sealed his own destiny. Has anyone ever come up to you and said, "You're not creative. " Yes. Well, they're wrong. You are creative. You are damn creative. Each and every one of you. You are so much more creative than all of the other dry, boring morons that you work with. Who you talking to specifically? I kind of know what it's like to be in commercials. My nickname in high school used to be kool-aid man. Younger, I always wanted to be an actor in commercials, then I realized I had a brain. I'm excited about doing the ad, but I'm not really used to doing videos with so many people around. We have three scenes to film, big scenes. We have a song to write, so let's get cracking. Kelly, I want you to do make-up. Oscar, I would like you to do costume design obviously. I'd like you to look around town and see if we have any celebrities in our local area. Sue Grafton is at the steamtown mall! She's doing a book signing right now. Phyllis, this is what I want you to do. I want you to go down to the mall. I want you to get in line. I want you to get her to be in this commercial. This would be a huge coupe, people, all right? - Do not take no for an answer. - Okay. Does anyone actually know what Sue Grafton looks like? - I mean, is she hot or - She's crazy hot. Well then maybe we should just use Angela and say she's Sue Grafton. - Would anyone notice? - That's not happening. I find the mystery genre disgusting. I hate being titillated. - Light it up! - Get her, Phyl.

I thought I was under the impression that this was going to be a rap. What's rap? Okay, Darryl You need to learn about your own culture. I'll make you a mix. Great. News flash. I got some juicy updates on operation fallen angel. Remind me to tell you later. Hey. Eh, no talk. I'm animating. Why don't we take a quick ten second break from that so I can show you what's going on here. Okay, this is Dwight's second life. He's on it all the time. So much so that his little guy here has created his own world. It's called Second Second Life, for those people who want to be removed even further from reality. - Are you serious? - Yeah. Oh, my god. He's really in pain. Who's that? Oh, it's just my avatar guy, whatever. He looks a lot like you! How much time did you spend on that? Not much. - It's just for tracking Dwight. - Right. You're a sportswriter in Philadelphia? Nice build too. Yep. You have a guitar slung on your back. I did not know you played guitar. I Why don't we go back to the animation? No, no! I want to see more of Philly Jim. I want Philly Jim. Ah, show me how this works. Oh, boy.

I just don't like it at all. And it's terrible. - You're on your own, Mike. - Okay, you know what? Hold on, Darryl. - You just said you hated it. - No, I said I I hate the style.   Break me off a piece of that lumber tar   -   Snickers bar   - Okay. This looks terrible.   break me off a piece   Andy, Andy! It's a pivotal scene in the ad. And if we don't get this, if we don't nail it, we're gonna lose the whole triumph of the moment. The triumph of the will. Now? God, what? What, Phyllis? Well, I got in line to buy Sue Grafton's book. On my turn, I asked her if she wanted to be in the ad, and she said "No, thanks," but I wasn't supposed to take "no" for an answer. - That a girl. - So I kept on asking, and they finally threw me out of the store in front of all my friends. Did you or did you not get Sue Grafton? No. Can somebody give her a tissue, please? Hope you're not killing yourself on it. 'Cause I'm sure it's good enough for Michael's ad that will probably be seen by no one. Maybe, but it's not good enough for me yet. Okay. Do you want me to stay? No, no, you can go home. I'm good. Pam is staying late tonight to achieve her dreams. So I'm pretty proud of her. - Unfortunately, she was my ride home. - You comin'? I Piss or get off the pot. - Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. - Good morning. Yeah, sorry. I looked away for a second, and Creed snatched your hash browns. - Thank you. - You're welcome. I worked until about 2:45 AM. And then I had to decide if I wanted to spend the night with Michael editing in his office, and Dwight watching Michael edit in his office, or drive home and probably fall asleep at the wheel and die in a fiery car wreck. I passed out on my keyboard trying to decide. Let me pour you some bubbly, because somebody got to a whole new level last night. Andy, I can't hear this right now. No, no, this is good. You know how we haven't gotten anywhere that I want to get to physically yet? Well, last night that changed. We're making out. I'm kissing her neck, and her cheek, and her earlobe. And she's not really kissing me back, but she closes her eyes and she's, like, "Oh, D. Oh, D." She called you D? Yeah. D for Andy. Oh, D. Oh, D. I'm about to send the ad to corporate. And it is sent. They'll probably watch it right away. I would. Okay. - Yes? - Pam, please clear my phone lines. Certainly. Okay, clear. They could call any second now. Oh, god. I better call. Well, it's been tough. The geniuses at corporate rejected my commercial. And tonight they are airing the brain-dead version. So welcome one and all to the world premiere of corporate crapfest! - Hey, seemed like a big hit. - No, people are stupid. People like waving. Waving sells. It's not art. Yet we made our ad. The real one was full of humor, and full of depth, and full of heart. And it was real. Hey, could you do me a favor? Could you put that in the dvd player? Hey, everybody. Just want to welcome you all to the premiere of the real Dunder Mifflin commercial. The Michael Scott director's cut. Hope you like it. It all starts with an idea. But you can never tell where an idea will end up. Because ideas spread. They change, grow. They connect us with the world. And in a fast moving world, where good news moves at the speed of time and bad news isn't always what it seems. Because when push comes to shove, we all deserve a second chance to score. Dunder Mifflin. Limitless paper in a paperless world. Really good. Animation? All her, by the way. - Really? The animation was cool. - Thanks. You ever been on a motorcycle? Michael, that was fun. That was fun. Next round of drinks is on me, people.   Claude Van Damme     Hair for men     Poison gas     Nutrasweet   It's gotta rhyme with "piece. " Fancy feast!   Break me off a piece of that fancy feast   It's a cat food. Nailed it. Dunder Mifflin, this is Rolando. Oh yes, she's been expecting your call. Yeah. - He's on line one. - Thanks, Ro. Hey, we finally connected. How's Scranton? I am the regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin Utica branch. Turns out it's a pretty easy gig when your boss isn't an idiot and your boyfriend's not in love with somebody else. Look, All I'm saying is it would be a great opportunity, and we'd love to have you come aboard. So think about it, okay? Okay, bye. For the record, a certain Scranton salesman approached me, okay? - This is perfect! - He looks like your twin. This is a dummy, a la "Ferris Bueller's Day Off". We have tied a string to the wrist, which goes to the door. When somebody opens the door, the hand goes down, hits the remote, turns on the tape recorder, which is me snoring. Now nobody knows whether I am here, or whether I am gone. - I will know. But you will not tell anyone. I won't need to because we'll be together playing hooky. Yeah. Well, sometimes. Most of the time I will be with Ryan, or Darryl. Yes? Oh good, good Stanley! First victim, this is what I want you to do. Go out, come back in. We're going to hide. I want you to tell me if this looks like me, okay? I don't understand why sleeping at your desk is better than you not being here. - Just go out, and come back in. I got an offer from Utica for more money, and I'm going to take it. What? Hey, everyone, can I have your attention, please? I just thought you all should know that Stanley Hudson is planning on leaving us, because our old friend Karen from Utica is going to give him more money to work there. You completely misinterpreted my tone, this is a horrible thing. Clearly, Karen is trying to get back at us because Jim dumped her. Oh, I don't think that is what's happening. Well, smarty pants, then why? Why is she trying to take Stanley from us? I think it's because of my sales record. That could not possibly be it. You cannot take the hilarious black guy from the office. Stanley is part of what makes this branch so extraordinary. The bluesy wisdom, the sassy remarks, the crossword puzzles, the smile, those big watery red eyes. I don't know how George Bush did it when Colin Powell left, and if Utica thinks that they are going to poach Stanley, they have another thing coming. - How can I get you to stay? - Money. Yeah, we all want money. But there is none in the budget, so Tell me why you're really leaving. - Money. Mo money mo problems, Stanley. You of all people should know that. Let me ask you this: If I were - Money. Oscar, did you bring it? To be Edwardian. His best work. Okay, well I have the tablecloth, don't forget the flatware. Sure thing Pam, can't wait. Oscar, Toby, and I are founding members of the Finer Things Club. We meet once a month to discuss books and art, celebrate culture in a very civilized way. Sometimes the debate can get heated, but we're always respectful. There is no paper, no plastic, and no work talk allowed. It's very exclusive. Besides having sex with men, I would say that the Finer Things Club is the gayest thing about me. So tell me again why I can't be part of your club. Because some people think you monopolize the conversation by trying to be funny. - Oscar? - Some people. - Hello? - Fillipellers, how's it hanging? - Michael - To the left? - To the right? - Listen, I'm, I'm - Okay, enough small talk, go ahead. - You called me. Yes, listen You cannot tear Stanley from his family like this. I'm pretty sure his family's coming with him. No, his work family. Look, this is very hard for me, but I'm going to give you my best man. You may have Toby. Toby's not a salesperson. You can train him. He's very very smart, and funny, and charming You know, I can't do it, Toby is the worst. That was a bluff, Listen, if you are going to poach one of my guys, I'm going to poach one of yours. - Goodbye Michael. - Okay, goodbye. Wait! Wait! Karen, could you transfer me to one of your salespeople, please? Your best one? I have Ben Nugent on the line, he is the top salesman in Utica. - Hi Ben, Michael Scott. - Hi, Michael. I'm going to cut right to the chase here. Do you like magic? Because I'm a genie in a bottle, and I'm going to grant you 3 wishes: To move to Scranton, to have a great job, and to be my best friend. Aren't you the guy that hit the woman with your car? Get out. Yeah. I also saved her life, but I guess that's not as grabby. Everyone says Scranton branch is worse than Camden. Didn't everyone from Stanford quit, like immediately? No, I fired them, and you're next. - So what do you say? - Seriously? What is that guy talking about? Scranton is not lame. Scranton is the cool fun branch. We're like Animal House. Found him! We're getting crapped on. Word is that our branch sucks, and we have to do something about it. - So what are you going to do? - What are we going to do? We are going to make a monster sale, that's what we're going to do. - Corcroan dropped Staples. - Did they? Yes they did, oh yes they did, and we are going to murder it. You, me, Dwight are going to jump into my PT Cruiser, and we're going to crush this sale. We're going to prove what the hell is that music? - It's Vivaldi, for Finer Things. - That's the problem, that's the problem. We need rock n' roll Pam, rock n' roll. Alright? Oh My God, that's why people are leaving. I have no words. - We just passed the exit for Corcroan. - What? What? We did? Surprise! Look at his face! Look at his face! What are we doing? What are we doing, Dwight, what we are doing? Well, gee, Jim, I don't know, I guess there's no sales call today. We are going on a panty raid to Utica, is what we're doing. We're going to Utica? - I'm not going to Utica right now. - Yes you are. Oh, buckle up Jim. We are going to make Karen wish that she had never been dumped by you. Utica! Utica! In your face. I can't believe you guys. I'm not going to go further piss off my ex-girlfriend. - Are you calling Karen? - No, I'm not calling Karen. - He's lying. - Yep, get it. What are you doing? Stop it, Dwight! Are you kidding me? No communication with the outside world, Jim. It had to be done, it had to be done. Well, that kind of sucks, because it had all the photos of my brother's new baby on it, Oh no, that is too bad. Shoot. Hey, Dwight, he found it. You know what? I'm just going to call a cab from here. Alright, you'll miss the best prank ever. Alright. Wait, what are you planning on doing? - Do you really wanna know? - Oh, God. Follow me, come here. Here's what we brought. We brought uniforms from the warehouse. I brought silly string, Dwight brought gasoline and chunks of rubber to make stink bombs. - Or real bombs. - No, no, not real bombs. Yeah, come on, it will be so badass. Maybe, maybe, I don't know. - No. It could be badass. Yeah, it will. - No, absolutely we are not doing this. - Come on, I already filled the bottles with the gas. it's going to be so badass! Are you kidding me? We've been driving around with this in the trunk the whole time? Teach her to offer Stanley more money. So the deal was, Dwight doesn't blow anything up, and I wear a costume. And a moustache. So, why did you and Karen break up? - Was it the sex? - What? I can't imagine the sex being bad, - I mean her body is awesome. - Why don't we play that alphabet game that you were talking about? - Okay, I will start. "A." "A" my name is Alan, and my wife's name is Alice, we live in Alaska, and we sell Damn it! What do we sell? Doesn't matter. - I'm trying to think of what we could sell. Doesn't matter. What is that? That sound The air-conditioning leaking or something? That doesn't make sense, couldn't be. What is that? Dwight, are you peeing? - I'm peeing in this empty can. - Oh my God! That is disgusting, Dwight! Well you said that we couldn't make anymore stops, and I really had to go. - Michael, watch the road! - Hey, you're making me spray! I'll kill you, man! - Michael! Michael, pull over! - That is just so disgusting! I think I cut my penis on the lid! Can you imagine a life where all you have to do is summer in the Italian countryside? I know right? I just want to go, and look at art, and swim in the Adriatic. And spend time with George Emerson. That's what I would do. I mean it's the best male protagonist we've read, right? - Totally, I mean, come on, such a free spirit. - What are you doing? Just came to discuss my favorite E.M. Forester novel. Pam, these finger sandwiches look finger-lickin' delicious. I'm sorry Andy, but this is a closed club. The Finer Things Club is the most exclusive club in this office. Naturally, it's where I need to be. The party planning committee is my back up, and Kevin's band is my safety. Fine. I'll just sit here, in the common area, and read my book. Which just happens to be the very same book you're reading. Alright, just know that you're not in the Finer Things Club. - Why can't I be in the club? I can't believe we're here, I can't believe this is happening. Believe it. - Afro wig, do you want the afro wig? - No, Michael. I'm not leaving the car. Alright, Dwight, here's how it's going to go down. You and I Guy's going by. You and I are going to sneak inside and pretend that we are warehouse workers. Then we will silly string the beejeezus out of the place. And if we have to defend ourselves, I will stab the security guy in the eye with the jumbo chalk. No, no, you won't do that. Nope. Then I'll grind up the jumbo chalk and blow it in his eyes. Dwight, nothing with the eyes, please? Okay, Jim. Oh my God, that's her! That's her, go, go, go. Let's move! Move, move, move, move! - Shut up! - This is the dumbest thing we've ever done. I think it's interesting how Forster uses Italy to represent sexuality and passion. And that also brought up themes of, uh, you know, fate and coincidence. And Lucy's torn between these two things. She's torn between passion and convention. Damn it! To be making a case for passion in Edwardian times, I thought was, uh - Yes! Damn it! Maybe sort of ahead of his time as a writer. - Very brave. - Very brave choice, I thought also. And George, his youthfulness. His, um, freedom. Evokes, um, feelings - What are you microwaving? - Popcorn. Why don't you use the microwave in the kitchen, Phyllis? Someone needs to clean it. It smells like popcorn. So, Stanley, are you really outta here? Yep, looks that way. I'm gonna miss you, man. You've been like an uncle to me. Like a kind old uncle Remus. I wanna stay in touch. - We are in a stairwell. - We are climbing some stairs. - I'm breathing heavily. - Okay, you know what? You don't need to be updating me as much as you're updating me. - Well - There's a guy, there's a guy. There's a security guard coming by. Hello, we're warehouse workers. Would you like more proof? Oh my God, that was very close. - I can see the security guard's eyes. - No, no, don't do anything to them. I have to do something to his eyes. The eyes are the groin of the head. Alright, Great Scott, if you found that choking hazard poster, just head on home. We found something far better, their crown jewel. Their industrial copier. - Isn't that thing huge? - It's enormous, but it's got wheels. We're wheeling it down the hall, into the stairwell. Get the car ready, keep the engine running. No, that is a terrible idea, don't do this. - My hip bone! - We're wedged between the copier and the railing. Ow, my leg! Jim, leave us. - Save yourself! - Don't leave us, help us, we need help Jim! First of all, stop using my name. And second of all- - Dwight, you gotta move! - Damn it guys! - Dwight, could you move over a little bit. - I'm losing control of my bladder. Oh my God, oh my God, Karen is back! Did you say Karen? Take her to a motel, make love to her, Jim. No, I'm not doing that. - Just say you wanna get back together. - No, I'm not doing that! It doesn't have to mean anything. Just do it for Stanley. Come on Jim, just climb on top of her and think about Stanley. Jim, if this is it for me, promise me something. Host the Dundies. Hey, Karen. What are you doing here? First of all, hi. What are you doing here? You good? I'm just checking on the other branches. Michael wants me to do that from time to time, so Do not tell Karen about the industrial copier. Copy that. I cried for weeks over that guy, so yeah, seeing him climb out of a PT Cruiser in a ladies warehouse uniform felt pretty good. Let me ask you, did you accomplish what you wanted? Listen, lady, you can expect these kind of repercussions as long as you keep trying to poach our people. I'm taking Stanley. Then we will burn Utica to the ground. Granted, maybe this was not the best idea but at least we care enough about our employees that we are willing to fight for them. And if you so much as harm a hair on Stanley's head, we will burn Utica to the ground. - Jim, hang on a second? - Yes. So you're still doing this kind of stuff, huh? Yeah, trying to quit though. If you wanted to see me, you could have just called me like an adult. Oh no, I didn't want to see you. Not that I'm not happy to be seeing you right now, I'm just saying ultimately I was here for the copier. Equal, I'd say it was equal. So, good to see you I mean, it's just that You know, Pam and I are still dating, so, and, I just mean that things are going really well, so I didn't want to see you. Oh, things are going really well? Are they? They are? That's great, that's so great. I wanna hear more about how happy you are with Pam. Can you tell me more about that? Thank you so much for coming to Utica, and breaking my copier, and telling me how well things are going in your relationship, really, thank you. - Alright. You are welcome. I'm going to go because of the traffic. - Traffic, yeah. Oh, def- go, go because of traffic, definitely, beat-beat the traffic. I will We tried and we failed. Stanley, you may go. Here is a box for your things, but I doubt that that box will be able to contain all the memories that you have of this place. Fly away, sweet little bird, fly away and be free. I'm gonna need some help writing a want ad. Wanted: middle aged black man with sass. Big butt, bigger heart. I can't do this. A word? Of course. I changed my mind, I wanna keep this job. Really? I wasn't really planning on leaving, all I wanted was a raise. How on Earth did Michael call my bluff? Is he some sort of secret genius? Sometimes I say crazy things. I'm so sorry, Rolando told me everything. How humiliating. Would it help you to return to another age? A time of refinement, and civility. Are you inviting me to the Finer Things Club? Come on! Angela's Ashes, top o' the morning to us. Frankie's prose is funnier than a pot of gold, say I. Did you get it out of your system? Yep. No, I mean I really liked it. I thought was a fun read. Fun? - Really? - Yeah. What was fun about it for you? Was it the death of the twins? No, that wasn't fun. - Did you even read it? - Of course I read it. - How does it end? - Who was the main character? Angela. Nope. The ashes. I really didn't think I was gonna have a good time but I did. I love camping.   Anything can happen   Well it wasn't camping. It was more of a wilderness retreat. - Morning. - Michael. Ryan invited some of the branch managers and Toby into the woods for a "get to know you" weekend. Michael wasn't invited. Apparently they already knew everything they needed to know about him. Did you sleep in cabins? Under the stars. It was really beautiful. You should've come. Bob and I took rock climbing lessons once. Michael wasn't invited on Ryan's camping trip. Toby went, but Michael didn't go. He wasn't invited. - Who went? - Me, Dan from Buffalo, Mark Chisholm, Jeff from Albany, and Ryan obviously. We had so many s'mores I finally had to say, "no more s'mores, no more s'mores. " Ryan invited me to go on his wilderness adventure retreat. It was this amazing, beautiful Hey, nobody cares. Nobody cares. I need that room at some point so just wrap it up. Michael wasn't invited. Episode 4x07 "SURVIVOR MAN" Hypothetically, if I were to ask you to go camping And you know what "hypothetical" means? - Not real. - Got it. So if I were to hypothetically ask you to go camping with me, - would you go? - Absolutely, yes. When Michael plays the hypothetical game, I always say yes. - Really? - Yeah. Do you wanna go today? And I am always busy. Oh, can't go today 'cause I'm donating blood. How often can you actually donate blood? Is there a limit? I don't Your body only has a certain amount. Well is that it, or Yeah, just this whole Toby camping thing. I don't know. It seems a little lame. - How so? - A bunch of guys in a tent making s'mores? - What's that? - Hello, I'm Broken Mountain. Here's the thing. That's not how you go camping. I think you go camping by yourself in the wilderness. It's not with a group of guys frolicking around in tents. It's one guy, or two guys if your plans change. - Not gonna change. - I want to do it myself. I want to go and find out something about myself. I want to get out of here. All the cliques and the office politics. Fluorescent lights and the asbestos. - I thought we had that looked at. - I'm sick of this place, Jim. When Jan and I had satellite, we used to watch a reality show called Survivorman, and it was interesting because it was about a guy who would go out into the middle of nowhere and just try not to die, try not to get eaten by an animal or be overexposed. Okay, I will only need two things: a roll of duct tape and a knife. - I'm on it. - Okay. Thirty minutes or less, please come back. Save the receipt. - Hey, what - Let's see if any of these will work. I keep various weaponry strategically placed around the office. I saved Jim's life with a can of pepper spray I had velcroed under my desk. People say, "Oh, it's dangerous to keep weapons in the home or the workplace. " Well I say it's better to be hurt by someone you know accidentally than by a stranger on purpose. Dwight and I are going out. He will return later, but I will not. I will also be taking a personal day tomorrow and perhaps the next day. Do you want me to ask where you're going? - No. - Great. Dwight'll be driving me deep into the Pennsylvania wilderness Where he will then leave me to either die or to survive. - The choice is yours. - No. The choice is actually yours. - Are you sure you wanna do this? - Yes, and I am leaving you in charge of the office for the rest of the day and for the next several days. - Don't try to follow me. - Great. This is a very personal, private experience in the wild that I wish to share - with me, myself, and I. - Yep. When I return, I hope to be a completely changed human being. That'd be great. Do I believe that Michael possesses the skills to survive in a hostel environment? Let's put it this way. No, I do not. This is what a true survivorman does. You simulate a disaster, like a plane wreck. You can only wear the clothes that you have on. And you can only use the stuff that you have in your pockets. Now in this case, this disaster is a serial killer, creepy guy who's abducted me, and is taking me out into the wilderness to leave me for dead. I would never leave you for dead. You would never escape. Well yes, I would and I would survive. I'Id make sure that you were dead, believe me. Then I'Id remove your teeth and cut off your fingertips so you couldn't be identified. And they would call me the overkill killer. You are as creepy as a real serial killer. - For real. Okay - What are you doing? I'm putting this on so I have no familiarity with my surroundings. Now this way I can't retrace my steps. I don't know what streets we - What are you doing? - It'Id be better if you're unconscious. God! Dwight, stop it! Stop it! Do you want to do this right or not? Please allow me to have one cathartic experience in my life? Jim, we need to order a cake for Creed's birthday. Wasn't it just someone's birthday? Yes, Kelly's was last week, remember? - I do remember, yeah. - It's birthday month. Creed's is today, Oscar's is week after next, Meredith's is at the end of the month. Michael usually goes with red an You know what? I have an idea. Why don't we just do one big shared party? What? There are 13 people working in this office. So 13 times a year, Michael gets a cake and balloons and some sort of joke gift and makes a toast. And there are two types of toasts. One is a joke about how old you are. Look at those wrinkles. Blacks do crack! Not crack the drug. And the other is something inappropriate or horrible. Or both. What else? He only sings the high harmony to Happy birthday. And he is a very big believer in surprise parties. Maybe even arguably, possibly to a fault. Happy birthday! Happy birthday! Happy birthday! So I think, yeah I think getting these out of the way might be productive. We can just have one big fun party. And everybody's happy and nobody wastes their time. I don't like it. You're shaking things up a bit, huh? - It's a pretty good idea, uh? - You think it's a good idea? No I think it's a great idea. We're here. Dwight will take my blindfold off when we are deep in the forest. Just the two of us from this point out. Here we go. Just the two of us. Here we go into the wild to the mighty forest. Can you smell the trees and the nature? Keep going. You're fine. Just some bushes and some thickets. Keep going. You wanted wilderness, you got it. Try sending them another invoice. - Okay. - All right. Oh, did you see my memo, by the way? "Let's be honest. As fun as birthday's are "we all could use a break from the constant cake. "So let's celebrate birthday month in style today. " This is really cool. - Right? - Yeah. I was just think No, totally. Totally. This way we get it all out of the way at once and it could actually be fun. Right! Exactly. I knew I could count on you. This is as good a spot as any. What are you doing? - Stop it. Dwight, just stop it! - I'm just Spin I'm trying to confuse your sense of direction! Behold. Good. Thank you, Dwight. - Here's your knife. - Thank you. - And here's your duct tape. - Good. - All right. - Very good. Okay. Yep. - Good luck, Michael. - Thanks for the ride. Okay Leave me be, Dwight. Hey Jim, can I have my own cake? - What's that? - I really prefer devil's food cake. Oh, sure. - Yes, awesome! - Okay. - That was easy. - People like me I guess. Jim. - I hate devil's food. - I think Meredith Screw Meredith. It's not fair someone else pick the cake on my birthday. - Everybody's birthday. - Today is my birthday - and I wanna pick the cake. - What you want? I want pie. I want peach pie. I want a nice cobbler. I'm gonna talk to Angela to see what we can do. No matter who you talk to, make it happen. - It'll be Angela. - You tell her it's for Creed. She'll know what that means. Day one. I'm in the interior of the vast Pennsylvania wilderness. I've brought with me only the bare essentials. A knife, roll of duct tape in case I need to fashion a shelter or make some sort of water vessel. It's hot today. The sun is in the two-thirds easterly quadrant which would make it about Really beating down on me now. And I think that I want to get a little more comfortable because the sun is depleting my resources. Okay. Oh, there we go. Watch that I don't hit my carotid artery here. I lied to Michael. I said that I would leave him alone, but I will not. I will remain close by to provide unseen moral support. But I will never help him. I will let harm befall him. I will even let him die. But I will never let him lose his dignity. There we go. Much better. Now everything I brought with me can be used. My sport coat here can be fashioned into a backpack of sorts. I'm going to wear what was once one of my pant legs. See this is a beautiful piece of material. This could be used for all sorts of things. Some sort of kerchief to keep my neck nice and comfortable. - Tuna. - Andy. Me likey the ice cream cake, okay? - "Fudgey the whale. " - Not your birthday. Well I'm just saying, you know, if you want to make people happy, namely me, you will have a fudgey the whale. All right. Gonna look into it. But the answer's no. Wow, okay. Harsh. Just don't expect me to show up. Hey Andy, I have some calls to make. - Loud and clear. - All right. - Pizza rolls. - I'm gonna go into this office here to do some work so I will be in here. Mushroom caps. I am totally alone right now with only my thoughts. I love it.   I'm lovin' it   I can literally say anything I want. No one is going to hear me. Wish I could've gone with Ryan on that cool retreat! Jan has plastic boobs! I- have-hemorrhoids! Doesn't even matter. Michael is a man of great depth and passion. I don't know what he's searching for out here. But I hope he finds it. Lunch. Well it is a little chillier than I had thought so I have fashioned my hat back into my pants. Several hours in. It's time for me to find some nourishment. Now these woods are full of creatures that can sustain human life. Things like squirrels. A nice, juicy rabbit would be delicious. About two more minutes. I have made this spear with which I will impale my dinner. And it couldn't come a moment too soon because I have been without food for a good three hours or so. Starting to feel it a little bit. It's Creed's birthday today.   Happy birthday to you     Happy birthday to you     Happy birthday dear Cre-ed     Happy birthday to you   Happy birthday, buddy. What is Jim thinking? It's a birthday. So what if there's a lot of them. Yeah, I work hard all day. I like knowing that there's going to be a break. Most days I just sit and wait for the break. I took an extra shot of insulin in preparation for this cake today. If I don't have some cake soon, I might die. - Why don't you have an apple? - Why don't you mind your business? Listen, I figured this out. Jimmy had his birthday three weeks ago so he doesn't care. - I think the power went to his head. - Hey, Jim! - Hey guys, what are we talking about? - Nothing. Nothing going on. We're talking about nothing. Come on, gang. Well if you take a look at this I tented my pants. I've made myself a nice pants tent shelter. And this little guy may be Dunder Mifflin paper someday. Nothing to worry about. Just using the scope. Safety is on. - Hey, Jim. - Toby. Hey, I just got the word on the communal birthdays. Great idea. Oh, thanks, man. Yeah. Is there anything I can My birthday was two months ago. - Oh, okay. - There was no party. - What? - Well there was. But Michael scheduled it for 4:58 on a friday. You know, people sang in the parking lot. Mmm, I remember that. I just thought, maybe you could - include me. - Seriously? I just thought you could add me in. I don't know what the harm in that is. Toby's great. He's great. But sometimes he can be a little bit much. "I don't see the harm in that. " Well it's a cake, Toby. So, come on. You know what? We're gonna throw you in because the more the merrier. No, no way. I am not a machine, Jim. You can't change plans willie-nillie and expect this little magic party elves to do your bidding. We already have devil's food, peach cobbler, "fudgey the whale," mushroom caps I'm allergic to mushrooms. That's a bummer. Okay Then we need to Hey, everybody. Hi, how are you doing? Can I have your attention? We've to talk about this birthday thing. - Conference room? - Yes, conference room. Five minutes. No. No. We're gonna solve it right here. We're gonna talk about it out here. So who has problems with the birthday thing? One, two, three Everybody. Okay, so then we just shouldn't do it. What am I supposed to do with two cakes and a pie? - Ooh, I'll take 'em! - Well nobody's touching my cobbler. Hey Michael I mean Jim. Yep, Phyllis called me Michael. And I will always and forever be haunted by that fact. Under this tree, I think I struck the motherload. Those are nature's best mushrooms. Wild, and I have to say, these little buggers are damn tasty as well. No! No, Michael! No! Give 'em up!   Happy birthday to you     Happy birthday to you     Happy birthday dear Creed     Happy birthday to you   Yeah!   Skip around the room     Skip around the room     We won't   Okay, all right. Yike, don't to that. You're gonna break something. Man became civilized for a reason. He decided that he like to have warmth and clothing and television and hamburgers and to walk upright, and to have a soft futon at the end of the day. He didn't want to have to struggle to survive. I don't need the woods. I have a nice wood desk. I don't need fresh air because I have the freshest air around: A.C. And I don't need wide open spaces. Check it out. I can also make it the sky. - Hi, buddy. - Hey. Word up. Sure glad you're back. You are relieved. You have no idea. So what did I miss? Well I tried to put all the birthdays together at once. - So terrible idea. - Yeah. Okay, I did that. Rookie mistake. - You did do it? - Yeah. Just wait. Ten years, you'll figure it out. Well I don't think I'll be here in ten years, but That's what I said. That's what she said! - That's what who says? - I never know. I just say it. I say stuff like that, you know, to lighten the tension when things sort of get hard. That's what she said. Hey! Nice! Really good. Bravo, my young ward. So the figures show improvement right there, Michael. And again I'll call back. You never call back. Every time Michael's in a meeting, he makes me come in and give him a post-it note telling him who's on the phone. I did it once, and he freaked out. He loved it so much. The thing is, he doesn't get that many calls. So he has me make them up every ten minutes. Tell him I'll call him back. - You can't just work 200 days a - Sorry. No, no. I don't have time for this. Tell him I'm in a meeting. So You have to know how to work this. There's no excuse for this. I can get you a tutor if you need This is a very important client. But I have the most important client sitting right in front of me my boss. - So I'll call him back - No. Customer service is obviously priority one. - You take the call. - N No, money isn't everything, Ryan. And you're my friend, and I don't wanna be rude. Take the call, friend. I refuse. No. My house, my rules I insist. I insist you take your work calls. Okay. All right, Pam, would you put the call through. Hiya, buddy.

Yeah, I hate that. So here's the deal. I am on my way to New York to be deposed as part of Jan's wrongful termination lawsuit. The company fired her for having the courage to augment her boobs. And they displayed a pattern of disrespect and inappropriate behaviors. Yes, yes. Pat-tern. Patt-ern. My friend friend Pat took a turn. That's how I remember that. Could we pull over and put down the top? My - I'm feeling a little queasy. - No, I want it up. My hair. Remember, it's not just a pattern. It's a pattern of disrespect and inappropriate behaviors. Disree. My friend Disree got new specs. Disree spect. My friend Inapro drives a Prius with his behind neighbor. - Does this work for you? - Yep! Tell 'em how much you're gonna get if you win. - Michael, that's tacky. - $1 million! - That's 4 million. - $4 million! Man! That is a lot of guacamole. Lot of green. Lotta green. That is why I have memorized Jan's answers. And I've also thrown in some ers and ahs just to make it seem like it's not memorized. Perfect crime. Stop saying ridiculous things. He's gonna tell the truth. The truth is very, you know, complicated. So we went over it carefully, and just not to leave anything up to chance or Michael's judgment. Could we please pull over and pull down the top? - I don't feel good. - I told you. I'm not putting it down! - I'm gonna puke. I'm gonna throw up. - Fine, just a second. Hold on. Schneider, real quick. What is a butt load of lawyers driving off a cliff? A good start. And I think it's "busload." Yeah, but rich lawyers took the bus. Where'd you find this guy? - Hey, there he is. Hey, hey. - Hey, Michael. Jan. I'm glad you're here. I need to talk to you. Can we talk off the record? As friends. I would love that. Jan has put the company in a very tough position here. You're with us for a long time. Over ten years, right? We just wanna be sure you won't do anything to hurt us with your testimony. Do you understand? Abso Really, yeah. I'll I'll do anything for the company. Good. That is great to hear. It is. Game, son! Okay, let's run it back. The warehouse got a ping-pong table last week. Now Jim comes down and plays with Darryl. Sometimes, I bring him juice. My boyfriend is 12. What has two skinny chicken legs and sucks at ping-pong? - Hi, Kelly. - Guess whose boyfriend it is? - I don't wanna guess. - I'll give you a hint. It's not my boyfriend. I think it's the guy over here. I don't talk trash, I talk smack. They're totally different. Trash talk is all hypothetical, like, "Your mom is so fat, she could eat internet." But smack talk is happening, like, right now. Like, "You're ugly, and I know it for a fact, 'cause I got the evidence right there." Jim Can I see you for a second? Sure. Okay, it's not regulation size, but it'll do. You have to practice. You've to get really good and beat Darryl. I can't beat Darryl. Please? Kelly's trash talking me because Darryl's beating you. What? Seriously? What is she saying? Your boyfriend is so weak, he needs steroids just to watch baseball. Jim couldn't hit a ping-pong ball of the size of the moon. Were Jim's parents first cousins that were also bad at ping-pong? So you're asking me to defend your honor against Kelly? Sorta, yes. - Bring me players. - Okay. Hi, everyone, Diane Kelly. I'm the company's chief legal counsel. Hi. No, no. Absolutely not. What is he doing here? Are you renewing your divorce vows before my deposition? Michael, I'm your H.R. rep. I'm on your side. No. I want him gone. - I don't talk until he leaves. - Michael, just relax. I think they're ready for us now. - Okay. - Thank you. Mr. Scott, do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth? "Yesh." Mr. Scott, can you describe the circumstances of Ms. Levinson's termination? Well, it was not just a termination. It was a pattern of disrespect and inappropriate behavior. Very good. Well put. People underestimate Michael. There are plenty of things that he is well above average at. Like ice skating. He is a very good ice skater. Hey, Kevin. Jim needs to see you. - About what? - He needs help balancing some travel receipts. Are you sure he wants me? Because I have Oscar balance my travel receipts. Yeah, no, he asked for you specifically. He's in the conference room. Awesome! How long have you known the plaintiff? I haven't actually seen it. But I have seen The Firm, and I plan on renting The Pelican Brief. How long have you known Ms. Levinson? Six years and two months. And you were directly under her the entire time? - That's what she said. - Excuse me? That's what she said. Ms. Levinson told you that she was your direct superior? - Why would she say that? - Can we move on to another question? I don't understand. Who's on record as saying this? With all due respect, I'm the middle of a line of questioning. Now, Mr. Scott, what did you say Ms. Levinson said regarding your employment status with respect to her corporate position? Come again? That's what she said. I don't know what If I may, he was telling a joke before. So can we move on to another question? - Are you sure? - Yes. Can you go back to where this digression began? Mr. Schneider: "And you were directly under her the entire time?" Mr. Scott: "That's what she said." Well Delivery's all wrong. She's butchering it. Yeah, that's what I thought. Did Ms. Levinson ever say why she thought she was being fired? She thought it had to do with the twins. - That's what I call them. - Can you be more specific? Who are the twins? To be delicate, they hang off milady's chest. - They make milk. - You don't need to go any further. - Her breasts. - Yes. She thought it had something to do with her recent breast surgery. Yes, and, frankly, the timing was nothing short of predominant. What about your romantic relationship with Ms. Levinson? Could that have played a part in her termination? Well, if it did, then the company is breaking its own rules. Interesting. How so? Because before we started dating, we disclosed our relationship to H.R. And I have the proof right here! Okay, the company has just a few clarifying questions, Mr. Scott, - if that's okay with you. - I will allow it. Would you mind, please, just taking a quick look at this photograph, please? That is you and Ms. Levinson in Jamaica. Is that correct? And that photograph was taken more than two months prior to the start of your relationship. Does that sound right? Mr. Scott, the time line here is actually very important. Please, when did your relationship actually begin? Well, depends on how you define "began." If it was from the first time we shook hands, it's like six years ago. The first time we kissed, it's like two years ago. - Excuse me? - From the first time we kissed sober, it was four months after that. - Could we take a short break? - No. Are you telling me that your relationship began two years ago and not in february, as you previously testified to here? - Line. - I'm sorry, what? He asked for a line, like in a play. "Mr. Scott, do you realize you just contradicted yourself?" "I did?" "Yes." "Can I go to the bathroom?" "I really have to. I've been drinking lots of water." "You went 5 minutes ago." "It wasn't to go to the bathroom. "but to get out of a question." "You've to answer it." "First, can I go to the bathroom?" "No." Good game, Meredith. - Don't patronize me. - All right. - What is going on here? - Dwight! Thank god you're here. It turns out one of our biggest clients is a ping-pong master. And I have to play him tomorrow, or we lose the account. Can you help me out? Will you help me practice? - What the hell? - I told you. All of my heroes are table tennis players. Zoran Primorac, Jan-Ove Waldner, Wong Tao, Jorg Rosskopf, and, of course, Ashraf Helmy. I even have a life-size poster of Hugo Hoyama on my wall. And the first time I left Pennsylvania was to go to the hall of fame induction ceremony of Andrzej Grubba. Jan and I had an on-again, off-again relationship for two years. And I know this destroys her case. And I am sorry. But I throw myself at the mercy of the deposition. Thank you, Mr. Scott. That's all we needed to know. Wait We'd like to enter in the record a page from Michael Scott's personal journal. What are you doing with my diary? This is plaintiff's exhibit 107. I quote from an entry dated January 4 of this past year. "Just got back from Jamaica. "Tan almost everywhere. "Jan almost everywhere. "Hee hee. "Oh, diary, what a week. "I had sex with my boss. "I don't know if it's going to go anywhere. "Jan was very specific "that this is not going anywhere. "That it was a one-time mistake. "But we had sex six times, so you tell me. I am definitely feeling very eerie." Irie. Irie, sorry. "More tomorrow. Xoxo, Michael." It would appear that neither you nor Ms. Levinson considered you had a relationship in any sense of the word, is that correct? We'll need to see a copy of that entire journal befo I don't think anyone in this room has a right to read my diary. Basic discovery. We've the right to review it. Okay, let's make ten copies of this diary. Could you make it 11? And we'll break for lunch so everyone can have a look. Can I sit here? You know, I I know a little bit about what you're going through, in a way. When I was a kid, my parents got divorced. They both wanted custody. And they both asked me to testify against the other one in court. So, I don't know. I didn't want them to get divorced in the first place. I loved them both so much. I just wanted How could you give up my diary? I had to. I'm sorry, but I need to win this. We need to win this. How'd you even find it? It's under my side of the mattress. I don't like the lump. I'm really upset. All right, I stole your diary and gave it to my lawyer. You e-mailed a topless photo of me to everyone in our company. - Let's call it even. - Fine. I love you. I love you too. Mr. Scott, who is this other woman Ryan, who you refer to here as "just as hot as Jan, but in a different way." Not a woman, just a cool, great-looking best friend. We're trying to determine whether Michael and Jan were engaged in a romantic affair. Not Michael and this Ryan person. - Excuse me. - All right. This is the way I see it. Yes, I had sex with Jan. And, yes, I did consider Jan to be my girlfriend. However, Jan clearly did not consider me to be her boyfriend. - So her actions're completely rightful. - Okay, Mr. Scott. It's admirable, the way you defend a woman who is so obviously ambivalent about her relationship with you. Thank you. You didn't have to say that. Considering she consistently gave you such poor performance reviews. That was before our relationship. She was going through a divorce. And she was drinking a lot. Okay. Of water. Mr. Scott, this is a copy of a particularly negative performance review. Would you mind reading the date on that, please? March 17th. And that would be a month after your relationship became official. - Is that correct? - Yes. You may read the highlighted portion out loud, if you want to. "I'm out of carrots. "I'm out of sticks. "Mr. Scott has time and again proven himself "to be an unmanageable employee "and a poor branch manager. "I recommend he be removed from that position and reassigned to sales, where he belongs." After hearing that, wouldn't you say that Ms. Levinson's judgment is at least very seriously flawed? Mr. Scott? How's it going? Well, he has gone from completely hopeless to simply miserable. Check this out, though. Spin serve. Wow, it works, like, Nice. So should I schedule the rematch with Darryl now? I'm ready. I'll make the call. Wait a minute. Darryl is the client? Oh, no, no. He works here, dumb-ass. Right. Spin serve. How could you do that to me? You can respond, but remember, it's going into the record. Michael, I'm not the enemy, okay? Dunder Mifflin is the enemy. Dunder Mifflin has always treated me with the utmost respect with loyalty. They were going to give me your job, and I should have taken it. Wait Before you go any further, let me show you what kind of loyalty they have, okay? Lester, please read that part of Wallace's deposition. Starting at paragraph six. Counsel: "Mr. Wallace, regarding Michael Scott, "was he a contender to replace Jan levinson?" David Wallace: "Yes." See? I was number one contender. I was being groomed. Counsel: "Was he your first choice?" David Wallace: "Michael Scott is a fine employee "who has been with the company many years." Counsel: "Was he in the top five of contenders?" David Wallace: "What do you want me to say? "Come on. He's a nice guy. "I considered many people." Counsel: "Was he being seriously considered for the corporate job?" David Wallace: "No." I have one more question, Mr. Scott. Wouldn't you agree with Ms. Levinson that the company exhibits a pattern of disrespect toward its employees? Absolutely not. Yes! Way to go. See that? Yeah, the floppy-haired girl you date won a point. Nice, baby! Nice one!   Hey, hey, you, you     I don't like your boyfriend     'Cause, 'cause     'cause he sucks at ping-pong   I'm sick of this! Let's go, you and me! - What? - Let's go. Pick up a paddle. - Okay. Bring it on. - I am. - Think you can handle this? - In my sleep. Okay. Volley for serve. P. O. P. O. Do you wanna go play on the table upstairs? Yes. Michael I'm very sorry. No biggie. Just No. No, no, no. Hey, this was rough. We never meant for you to get caught in the middle of this. I'm very sorry. Hey, David Yeah? I think you're a nice guy too. Thanks, Michael. Why did I do it? I don't know. Jan said that it was because of the photo that she revealed the diary. But she already brought the diary with her to New York. So You expect to get screwed by your company. But you never expect to get screwed by your girlfriend. What do you wanna do for dinner? How 'bout chinese? We should really try to save some money. Get something cheap. That was my cheap suggestion. Chinese was my cheap suggestion. Wanna do fast food? Fine. Fast food's fine. This is ridiculous. Do you have any idea what time we get out of here? Nobody likes to work late. Least of all, me. - You have plans tonight? - No, I don't. Remember when you told us not to make plans 'cause we were working? Yes, I remember. This is B.S. This is B.S. Why are we here? I am gonna call corporate. Enough is enough. I'm God, I'm so mad! This is Michael Scott, Scranton. We don't wanna work. No, we don't! It's not fair to these people! These people are my friends, and I care about them! We're not gonna do it! Everybody, I just got off the horn with corporate, and basically I told them where they could stick their overtime assignment. - Go enjoy your friday. - Thank you, Michael. - I think we dodged a bullet there. - I think you did. I think we should celebrate. How about you, Pam, mi casa A little dinner, dancing, drinks? - Oh, I - You said you didn't have plans. That's what you said. Michael has asked Pam and me to dinner at least nine times. An every time, we've been able to get out of it. But I've got to give him credit. He got me. Because I'm starting to suspect that there was no assignment from corporate. Michael, what time should I be arriving? Dwight, it's couples only. And besides, I only have six wine glasses. So it will be me and Jan, and Pam and Jim. And Angela and Andy. Does it bother me that I wasn't invited to Michael's dinner party?

And they're both winning. So I am going to make a run for it. I just got a message from my landlord. Apparently, my apartment flooded. - Something with the sprinkler. - Oh, no!

Okay, he's the governor of California. - He is the terminator. - Those aren't helpful. - Tom Cruise! - Time! God! Does anybody read the paper?! Here you go. - Oh, thank you. - You're welcome. I'm so, so sorry for the temperature in here. The, um sliding glass door shattered. - So - It's okay. It's actually a really cute story. Do you wanna tell it, babe or should I tell it? - I don't like that story, babe. - Come on! It's a cute stor Michael ran through the sliding glass door because he thought he heard the ice cream truck. Stop. Stop it! I mean, I like ice cream, okay? Sue me. Oh, no, don't. I shouldn't say that jokingly because she will sue me. She loves to sue. She loves lawsuits. You know, honey, that door was extremely clean and it looked invisible. You are so right. You are so right! Because before I lived here, the glass was always covered in smudges. And I moved in and I cleaned it, so I guess that makes me the devil. You are! She is! She is the devil! I'm in hell! - I'm burning. Help me. - You shouldn't joke about that. - Is there more wine in the kitchen? - I will get it. I will get it. What kind of hostess would I be if - It's okay - No, no. In fact, you know what? Girls' trip. Angela, come on. Girls' trip. Oh, not even close. So you keep a very tidy house. You should see our bathroom after Michael takes a bath. - But I don't need to tell you, Pam. - Oh, yeah What? Oh, don't tell me that he's really changed since you guys dated. Oh, are you joking? Michael told me a little bit about it, but I see the way you look at him. I have never, ever dated or wanted to do anything resembling dating Michael, ever. Not ever, not now, not then, not now, not ever, ever. I've noticed how you look at him at the office. So I spend most of my time right here. Have a hand. So, Jim, I noticed you checking out Jan's candles. Oh, no, she just put it in front of my face. Yeah Did you know that candles are the number one fastest-growing product in the scent aroma market? $2 billion a year industry. And for only $10,000, you could become a co-owner of "Serenity by Jan." - What do you think about that? - Thought about it. I'm in. I'm sorry, are you really trying to get us to invest in Jan's company? I'm sorry. What now? Coming. Hello. What are you doing here? We came here to eat dinner and to party. This is a dinner party, right? - Awesome! - What is he doing here? - Yes, what are you doing here? - Dwight is friend. We weren't invited? You said that I could not invite Dwight because he was not part of a couple, and because we didn't have enough wine glasses. Dwight brought glasses and a person. Fine. Whatever you want. Just like always. Whatever you want. Whatever I want? It's never whatever I want. - It's fine, Michael. - When I wanted to see Stop and you wanted to see Wicked, what did we see? We saw Wic When I said that I wanted to have kids, and you said that you wanted me to have a vasectomy, what did I do? And then, when you said that you might wanna have kids, and I wasn't so sure, who had the vasectomy reversed? And when you said you definitely didn't want? Who had it reversed back? Snip, snap! Snip, snap! Snip, snap! - I did! - Okay You have no idea the physical toll that three vasectomies have on a person! And I bought this condo - to fill with children. - I am so sorry that I don't want to bring kids into this screwed-up world. - Okay? But look - Sorry too. If you want to have kids, then fine, you win. Let's have a fuckin' kid! You mean it? You wanna have a kid? I hate my life. So can we come in? Great turkey leg. Okay, I'm just gonna check on dinner. Angela, would you like some of my beet salad? I hate beet salad. It's actually really good. I know you love beet salad. I've seen you eat it many times. The thought of popping one of your beets into my mouth makes me want to vomit. Pam I hope she didn't do anything to the food. Like what? I can't prove it, but I think she might be trying to poison me. - Hey, looks great, babe. - Yeah, it really does. I know Jan didn't poison the food. I know that. But if she was going to poison the food of someone at that table, wouldn't it be me? Michael's former lover. Can you not do that? It's disgusting. You know I have soft teeth. How could you say that? Excuse me for a second. So How do you guys know each other? I was his babysitter. And now you guys are dating? It's purely carnal, that's all you need to know. Would you write down your email? Because I have just so many questions. Email? Never mind. All right. There we go. There. - That's nice. - Everybody enjoy their meal. Hey, babe. How'bout we take the beer sign down until our guests leave, and then we can discuss it? No I'm gonna leave it up. I think it ties the whole room together. Okay. Jan thinks Hunter is very talented. You know what? I don't think he's that good. At least he's an artist. B.F.D., I'm a screenwriter. And I'm a candle maker, but you don't hear me braggin'about it! No, all you do is you get me to try to work on my rich friends. For an investment opportunity! Man, I would love to burn your candles! You burn it, you buy it! Oh, good, I'll be your first customer! You're hardly my first. That's what she said! That is a $200 plasma screen TV that you just killed! Good luck paying me back on your zero dollars a year salary plus benefits, babe! - I'm gonna get going. - Fine, get out of here. It's getting late. You know what, she'll be out of the bathroom soon. Of course. Get out of my way. I'll take care of this. Okay, what seems to be the problem, officers? Not now, Dwight. We got a call about a disturbance? No. Nope. Nothing disturbing here. Just a couple of friends having an awesome dinner party. Your neighbors heard shouting. Yes, there was screaming, but My girlfriend threw a dundie at my TV. A plasma. - You want to press charges? - Would she get into trouble? Yeah, she'd be charged. I will take the fall. - I did it. - You don't have to press charges. You could just try to be more quiet. - Michael! - Yes. What what are you doing to him? Sir, do you have any other place you could stay? Maybe with one of your friends here? Michael can come home with me. Jim, Pam? - Oh, my apartment's on fire. - Flooded. You people! - Come on, you're sleeping with me. - No. - I'm gonna take you home, Michael. - No. Come with me. All right. Bye, babe! This is the best burger I've ever had, babe. Babe, I should have told you, but I did something bad. I stole this. For you, babe. I love that. W.B. Jones is renovating their offices and their cruise are taking up some of the parking spaces we used to get. So we had to park at a satellite parking lot over there. Which just means we get to see more of our lovely street. Tell them what we saw today, Jim. Oh, today we saw a junkyard dog attacking the bones of a rotisserie chicken. Nature. I've been here 9 years, and suddenly I'm supposed to park half a mile away. I lost a penny out of my loafers, Oscar. I will quit. As God is my witness, I will quit if this is not fixed. Some of us like the walk more than others. It hurts like hell. Episode 4x10 "CHAIR MODEL" Did you pick a new chair? It's been a while. Pam, when I first opened this catalog, I thought I was just going to be picking out a chair. But instead you found something to distract you from picking out a chair. Michael started the process of selecting a new chair about three weeks ago. And normally I wouldn't care but he promised me his old one. It's way better. It's one of these: I really want it. - Have you ever seen this woman? - Her? The one in the really great mesh, black, hi-back swivel chair? Look at her smile. It's the eyes. Look at her eyes. She's got I don't know what it is exactly. She dresses like a professional, and yet you know there is a side of her that could just curl up on a couch. Or in a great chair. Yeah, maybe, but Remember after my dinner party when I said that I was swearing off women? I definitely remember your dinner party. I think what I meant was that I am completely swearing off one woman: Jan. I think that fate put this catalog in my hands. Actually, I put the catalog in your hand 'cause you have to pick out a new chair. What is it like being single? I like it. I like starting each day with a sense of possibility. And I'm optimistic, because every day I get a little more desperate and desperate situations yield the quickest results. Ladies and gentlemen, would you please open your supply catalogs and kindly turn to page 85? - Yo, is this his new chair? - No, he hasn't picked one yet. When Pam gets Michael's old chair, I get Pam's old chair. Then I'll have two chairs. Only one to go. I am ready to start dating again. Getting back on the market. So FYI, for those of you who're thinking about fixing me up, with any of your friends, use the woman on page 85 as a template. That will be all. I left my cell phone in my car. Call us when you get there so we know you're okay. Listen, man I am completely over Jan. So would you set me up? If I had somebody to set you up with, Michael, then I'd take her for myself. - I thought you were engaged. - Nope. Stacy broke up with me. What? God, that's terrible, man. She's crazy. Um, are you still on good terms with any of her friends? Not anymore. It's a bitter situation. Yeah She's You don't deserve her. All right. Hello, Oscar Meyer weiner lover. I bet that you have a bunch of very liberal girl-type friends who trust you implicitly because they know you'd never touch 'em 'cause of your condition. - Michael? - What? I have a friend who's single. Sandy. She's gorgeous and she's got a feisty personality too. Feisty So she's not jolly or sassy? Not like a jolly, sassy opera singer? No, she's a professional softball player. - Catcher or in field? - I don't know, Michael. Is she a dress-wearer or a pants-wearer? Could we share a rowboat? Could a rowboat support her? What are you asking? I think I'm being very clear what I'm asking. Would an average-sized rowboat support her without capsizing? It bothers me that you're not answering the question. No, all right? She can't fit in a rowboat. Damn it! I knew it! I knew it, Phyllis! What is wrong with these people? I would do anything for them, and they're just hanging me out to dry. Dating shouldn't be hard for somebody like me but it is, and you know why? Because nobody here is willing to help me. Nothing would ever get done in this office without a formal request, would it? Well fine, here goes. - I don't think that - Now okay, I know that this is probably not appropriate. But I need help. Because I want to play ball with my kids before I get too old. And before that happens, I need to get laid. And before that happens, I need to be in love. And I don't wanna hear, "I don't know, I can't help, na na na." No, no, I am a catch, and I am not going to be the one who got away. So this is what we're going to do. Dwight is going to hand out index cards, and I want you all to write down the name of an eligible woman for me to date by the end of the day. No, by the end of the hour, or you are fired. Write legibly, people. Because of the construction at W.B. Jones, half of us have to park in the satellite lot. - It's, like, a 10 minute walk. - No, 30. Look, I have an assigned parking place in front, so All right, all right. Let me try to think about what it would be like to not have one. Okay, yes, that would be bad. - That would be bad. - Okay, so - help us out. - Wish I could, but I can't. Well can, but won't. Should, maybe, but shorn't. Michael, please What part of shorn't don't you understand, Kevin? Look, I could probably handle it, yes, but I think it would be a good exercise for you to do it yourselves. - We won't let you down. - You can't because I don't care. Don't forget to fill out those cards. My love cards. There's nobody I hate enough to write her name on this card. Well, I'm setting Michael up with my fat friend anyway. He can just deal with it. - Who are you putting down? - Oh, you don't know her. - Who is it? - Your mom. Yeah, whatever. Give that to me! Give that to Okay, "Wendy" Hot and juicy redhead. Let's give this a try. Wendy's. Hello, Wendy. This is Kevin's friend Michael. This isn't Wendy. Sorry. Could you put her on, please? Dude, this is a Wendy's restaurant. Damnit, Kevin. Okay Could I just have a frosty and a baked potato, please? You've to come here to order food. I'll send somebody to pick it up, just have it ready. It's ready now. Well, put it aside. - I've collected the rest of the ladies. - Good, good. Because this batch was awful. - This one says "chair model." - I wrote that. Michael, you shouldn't have to settle. This is my pledge to you. I will find her, and I will bring her to you. And as God is my witness, she shall bear your fruit. That sounds good. Go get her. Wait! First go to Wendy's, get my food, come back, and then go. That is fantastic. Thank you, thank you very much. This is just what I needed. The furniture company gave me the name of the advertising agency. They gave me the name of the photographer. The photographer, a spaniard, used a Wilkes-Barre modeling agency. The agency gave me the following information: Debrah Shoshlefski, Dead, car accident. Case closed. She's dead? She's so young. She was so young and now, she's dead. As dead as every dead animal who has ever died. God. Why don't you sit down, Michael? Come on. There we go. Michael, you didn't even know her. Try not to be so hurtful, Jim. - Jim, how dare you? - Not at time like this. Okay, Michael, you know what? I might have someone for you. Oh, really? What's her name? Burgerking? No, I mean it. She's really nice and sweet and you guys might actually get along. I don't think I'm ready Is she hot? I'm setting Michael up with my landlady. She's really sweet and Whatever, I just can't take Michael like this. No question about it, I am ready to get hurt again. We need to assemble the five families. - No, not the five families. - We have to! The five families are the five companies of Scranton business park. The bosses rarely meet. There's Michael Scott, regional manager, Dunder Mifflin. Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration. Paul Faust of Disaster Kits Limited. They call him "Cool Guy Paul". W.B. Jones of W.B. Jones heating and air. Grade a badass. And Bill Cress of Cress Tool and Die. Bill Cress is super old and really mean. Kevin, I don't have time for this right now. I'm trying to get a date with Pam's hot friend. And she needs to meet me right now. I'm calling the meeting anyway. Thank you very much. Our suspect has straight brown hair. She is wearing blue jeans and a black top. So behold our bachelorette. Give her a 10 for her looks and a 3 for her ability to describe herself. Hello, my lady. Are you Michael Scott? Is who a Michael what? I'm sorry. I'm supposed to be meeting someone named Michael. That's not Yeah, I'm not Michael? Large hot chocolate with caramel and a shot of peppermint. So you get the rent checks every month and What happens next? What You're asking me what I do with the checks that people write to me? Just making conversation. Why is it so hard to meet people? I You know, it's All I want is somebody nice, and sweet, and someone I can talk to and share an experience with, you know? Why is it so hard for people like us? I don't know. You wanna see what I walked out on? This is going to blow your mind. Look at that! - She's beautiful. - Yeah. And you can't see her whole body, down here, she has a boob job. Just She was just crazy smart and really manipulative and I don't know. Michael? Hello Well, I'm gonna head out. Well I enjoyed this conversation. It was very nice. It was like talking to the sweet, old lady on the bus. That's incredibly rude. Now you ruined it. Where's Scott? Michael Scott could not make it today due to an unforeseen prior engagement. - Let's just meet back in an hour. - Gentlemen, please. We called this meeting. Andrew Bernard is the name of me, and this is my associate, Mr. Kevin Malone. I have things. All right, what do you want? Well, first of all, I'd just like to say what an honor it is to be sitting here - with you - You've 10 seconds. We want our parking spaces back. - Whose parking spaces? - W.B. Jones's construction guys park in our parking spaces every morning, and some people have to park really far away and walk all the way to the office. And some people sweat too much for comfort and My God. I don't have time for this, guys. Just give 'em back their spaces. - Okay. - We good? Okay. Could've done this over email. After Stacy left, things did not go well for a while. And it was hard to see It's just nice to win one. Margaret the landlady? Really, Pam? Is that what you think of me? She's sweet and cute. I thought you would get along. Oh, okay. Well, I'm looking for a passionate affair, not companionship. I'm a man of intensity. Of of cool, and youth, and and passionately. God - Margaret? - I know You just got yourself kicked out of your apartment. Oh, I don't care. I don't really like that place that much anyway. - I'll just move. - Oh, really? Who's gonna take you in? You're messy. You're a klutz, you spill everything. And you leave the volume on the TV way too loud. Yeah. Maybe I'll move in with my boyfriend 'cause he's kind of a slob too. Okay. Sure. Let's do it. No, I Well, I'm not gonna I'm I'm not gonna move in with anyone unless I'm engaged. Have I not proposed you yet? I don't No. Well, that's comin'. Oh, right now? No. I'm not gonna do it right here. That would be rather lame. Okay, so then when? I'm not gonna tell you. I hate to break it to you, but that's not how it works. Oh, right. Yeah. Wait, I'm serious. - It's happening. - Okay. And when it happens, it's going to kick your ass, Beesly. So Stay sharp. I've been warned. I am not kidding. Got it a week after we started dating. I don't know, man. I was with Jan for so long I was excited about meeting somebody new. Put my heart out there. You know what you need? Closure. You're right. What do you mean though? There was a woman in your life who affected you very deeply, and she left before you could say good-bye. I think you need to say good-bye. Come on. I'll drive. - We did it! - I did it. We got our spaces back. Nice job. - Nice. - Yeah. There it is. You're welcome. Did I do this for me? No. I did this for the little guy. For Joe six-pack, the guy who wakes up every morning in his $400 a month appartment, wonders how he's gonna pay his mortgage this month. Wonders how he's gonna fill his car up with oil. Wonders how am I going to pay my kids' orphanage bills? That guy shouldn't have to wonder where he's gonna park. How did she die? I guess you could say she died of blunt force trauma and blood loss. She got in a car accident and ploughed into the sight of an airplane hangar. - God - Yeah. She was so innocent. She was stoned apparently. You know, I used to think that I had this perfect person out there waiting for me. But now I know that that's just silly. Because she's dead. What do you do? You wait till next year's chair catalogue comes out and find someone who's still alive. - You move on. - Yeah. Where do you wanna go for dinner? I don't know. I kinda hate all our regular places right now. You know what? That one Hey, Pam. Will you wait for me one second while I tie my shoe? - I hate you. - What? My shoe is untied. What is your problem? Oh, my god! You thought I - No, no, no. - How could I have thought that? Bye, bye, miss chairmodel lady I dreamt that we were married and you treated me nice We had lots of kids Drinking whiskey and rye Why d'you have to go off and die? Why d'you have to go off and die? You believe in rock'n roll? Can music save your mortal soul? And then, can you have to dance real slow? Well, I know that you're in love with him 'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym - Kicked off both her shoes - Turned off her shoes - No more rhythm and blues! - No verdict was returned! Rhythm and blues. This will be the day that I die   What's wrong, Michael? I got gum in my hair. - You do. - This just stinks. Don't touch it. Please, don't touch it! - You got a ton of dandruff. - Okay, let me be. How'd you do? I was walking in and I noticed something shiny under Stanley's car. And I gone under seeing what it was and I messed up my hair. All for a stupid piece of tinfoil. But, best-case scenario, you thought it was a quarter. Kill me, right now. We have peanut butter in the kitchen. I don't feel like peanut butter. Get me an ice cream sandwich. Nope, not for you, it's for your hair. And it's 9:00 AM. Dwight, not the good peanut butter People are gonna get mad. This is my hair we're talking about. Smells good. - Taste good, too. - Oh, don't, that's disgusting. Lot of calories. Well, just don't leave it on too long. Keep massaging, please. Yeah, that's nice. Episode 4x11 "NIGHT OUT" Hey, Michael, how was your date last night? I will be honest. The dating has not been going well. Look Men are visual creatures. We crave beauty. Like a piece of fine art by any number of renowned artists. Or an arty photograph of Cindy Crawford nude. That, but the women I'm getting fixed up with are Not that they aren't nice or that have great personalities. They just They just lack a certain Crawfordness. I am livid. Absolutely livid. It's ridiculous. Yes, I'm having the Scranton branch come in on one saturday so they can reenter sales that they made on the phone, as sales made by the website, which they should've done in the first place If the website had been working. My favorite branch. How's everybody doin'? Man, you mind if I run something by you? Love it! Go. Well, I kind of feel like what we had going for us is our customer service. And no matter how much we change this up, I don't know that a website's gonna be able to replace that. I can tell you've thought about this. I appreciate that. - Thanks. - David Wallace does too. You told him all about this at the Christmas party, right? - I I don't - You did, yeah. Watch your back, Jim. I'm just kidding. Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention please? I know that a lot of you are very angry with Ryan because he's the reason we've to come in tomorrow. However, I swear to God, if any of you hurts him in any way, emotionally, or taunts him or makes fun of his height or his half-beard Okay. Thanks, Michael. I'm here today to do some creative problem solving about Dunder-Mifflin Infiny - and fill in your questions. - Question. Why am I being forced to pretend a website made sales that I made? This is a temporary measure to increase the legitimacy of the site. I don't like when my clients call me to help them use the website. I'm not seeing commissions on that. I hear you, Stanley. That is a great observation. Problems like that will not happen when we'll launch Dunder-Mifflin Infiny 2.0. - When will that be? - TBD. Did the police solve the problem with Yes, yes, they did. Yes, they did. Yes, the social networking feature of the Dunder-Mifflin Infinity website was infiltrated by sexual predators. I don't understand why our website needs to have social networking at all. I've to agree with Dwight on that one. It's all about creating a one-stop consumer experience. All right? You're chatting with your friends, you're talking about the latest music. About the election. All of it is happening in our virtual paper store. And then an older gentleman asks you, "boxers or briefs?" I don't get the big fuss here. I like the site. If I had created a website with this many problems, I'd kill myself. - You've a question, Kelly? - I've a lot of questions. Number one: how dare you? Ryan has done a very good job. And I'm not applauding sarcastically. Think about it. A month ago, nobody would go on this site because we were worried out getting molested or loosing our identity, having it stolen. But now, at a time TDB, all of these problems will be in the past. You done good, kid. You done good. Well, it has been nice seeing you again, my friend. You too. Oh, Ryan, I need a girlfriend so bad. Michael, let me go. Let me go, Michael. All right. Do you know many girls in New-York you might wanna hook me up with that might be interested in a guy like me? - Nah. - Nah. - Sorry, man - Well, you tried. But, seriously You should see the girls I meet at clubs in the city. - Unreal. - They sound great. Bye, everyone! Stay real, Scranton, all right? Peace! - Would you have sex with Meredith? - What? - Do you think she'd keep it quiet? - I'm gonna go to my desk. Jim, it's not the horniness, okay? It's the loneliness. That's I know. - Let's go to New-York club with Ryan. - I can't. You can. You're single, I'm single. It'll be awesome. - I'm not single. - Who are you dating? - Pam. - That's still going on? Okay, Dwight, grab your stuff. We're going to New-York, to party with Ryan and to meet girls. - Yeah! - Oh, yes. Count me in, dudes. I am in serious need of some bro'time. Old ball and chain's been a lot more chain than ball lately, - if you know what I'm saying. - I'm right here. No, singles only. Singles only. Also three is unlucky. - Curse of three. - Sorry, Andy. Cannot take any chances on curses. Let's go. Everybody, I will see you tomorrow, saturday morning. Probably wearing the same clothes that I'm wearing right now. If you catch my drift. We get it. I am going to go get laid. Good-bye! With sex! You know what? If we stay 2 hours late tonight without Michael distracting us, we wouldn't have to come in all tomorrow. So I caught everyone before they left, and I told them my idea. And they loved it. Because this is a group that respects good ideas. The one time a year they hear one. Ryan's assistant told us that he would be at this club this evening. It is called Prerogative. This place is packed! Fire hazard. Packed with beautiful babies! Swingers. Classic. Jon Favreau, tall guy from Dodgeball. Women look like white slaves. No, they're just hot. Hotties. I don't know. When you think about it, Cabo is really the third world. I don't go to a place like that to see more poverty, you know? You go there to get some glamour - What are you doin' here? - Well, you know, just taking you up on your offer to party so That is so awesome, man! All right! - And you brought this guy! - Yeah! Ryan, it's Michael and Dwight. I know it's you guys! I'm so psyched you're here. Well All right! - Let's get a drink! - Let's do it! Thanks a lot, guys! Good job! Later. Nice job, everybody. Great work. Did you not tell the security guard we were working late? Nope. I didn't. Then let's go inside and I can call him right now. We can't. I locked the office from the inside when we left. Perfect. You guys worked together on this one. If I'm not in my bath with a glass of red wine in 1 hour, you're both dead. There is a master key and a spare key for the office. Dwight has them both. When I asked, "what if you die, Dwight? How will we get into the office?" He said, "if I'm dead, you guys have been dead for weeks." Guys, I want you to meet a really good friend of mine. This is Troy. - Nice to meet you. - How're you doing? Hi. Dwight. You resemble the Tolkien character. He basically is, man. He's a regular banking wizard. No, no, not a wizard. A hobbit. Model's service's here. Okay All I know is I would like some chicken fingers and a Midori Sour. We don't serve food here. Okay. Then just bring me two cups, one with olives, and another one filled with maraschino cherries. Do you live in a regular-sized house? Yeah, he's a normal guy. He's cool. You really don't have his number? I told you I have the number that rings here. Do you want that number? I might have it in here. Wow, that's great, Toby. It's so random that I have it. Toby, you're the best! When I put it in, I thought it might be a waste of time but it was worth it. Great. It's under here as "security guard - home". Did you not get his name No. It's ringing Anybody have his name, quick? It's Eddie. It's not It's not Eddie. It's Evan or Hank. His name is Hank. No, guys, his name is not Hank, it's Is it Hedgar? Elliot. Is it Elliot? Hey Chief. This is Jim Halpert from where you work. You're the guy who sits behind the desk. You're the the african-american guy. I mean, you're Who have I got here? Dwight Schrute, man. How're Schrute farms? - Good. - This guy owns his own beet farm. Insane! Well, it's weevil season, but we were prepared. "Weevil" What a crazy word, man. I don't even know what that means? What does that mean? They lay their eggs inside the unripe beetroot, then, come springtime, the babies eat their way out. - Crazy! - Crazy! That's too much for me, man. I'm gonna head to the bathroom. - You've already been several times. - Yeah? - Maybe you got a bladder infection. - I don't know. Maybe. - I'll order you some cranberry juice. - With vodka. You're the best! Do you have powers? Oh, thank you, Hank. You are a lifesaver, Hank. Appreciate it. All right, so Hank is gonna come down here. He's gonna let us all out. He said it should be just under an hour, so We did it. We should all make sure to give him a big tip this Christmas. Sorry, guys, but I don't think I tipped him for last year's. Neither did I. Jim was supposed to collect it. - Way to go, man. - Now he's never gonna come. By show of hands, who thinks we're a better couple than Jim and Pam? Phyllis I thought about getting a tatoo on my back as well, at one point. I was thinking about getting Back to the Future. "Back" because it's on my back. And "future" because I'm the kind of guy who likes to look ahead into the future. I just think a tattoo should mean something. You know? And it's my second-favorite movie. I've never heard of that movie. Back to the Future?! Well, you should take a film education course. - How old are you? - 40 I'm in my 40s. That's so cool. Yeah. Well, I'm gonna go back to my group now. Oh, okay. - Thanks for the drink. - You're welcome. This place is like a like a sexy preschool. You wanted to meet older women? I would love a place where we can meet older girls. Hell, yeah! I'll hook it up! That's dangerous. Excuse me. Yeah? How did you find each other? We're the Jersey Varsity basketball team. North east regional champs. Amazons! It's off. It's not the dude I know. But some other loser who won't let us in without chicks. - You're kidding. - Let's bail. Wait, wait. You two, uh, Jersey state girls, let's go. We're not going unless we can all go. Okay, you know what? Fine. Let's go, two girls to a guy. Come on, let's do it. Come on, Ryan. Move out! Okay, three or four with him. Let's go, come on. Here we go. Don't step on him. Hey, look what I found in the back. Wanna play? Teach you to throw. - I know how to throw a football. - Of course you do. Yeah, Pam! Hip me up! Go long! There you go. Wait a minute. What is this? I didn't order this. It's for you. From them. What are you doing, man? It's not safe. Anything could have been in there. Nice try! I've never met anybody who does that. You wash dogs? Very cool. That's one aspect of small pet grooming. What do you do? I am a bank teller. Ryan told me to always tell a woman you work in finance. - Cool. - I think so. Yeah, I have fun. I'm just gonna use the powder room. - All right. - So I'll see you soon. Very perfect. This needs to be shared. She washes dogs! - You doin' it. - I know! I don't wanna get ahead of myself, but I think I want her to meet my mom. Hey, man Do you ever think there's gonna be this massive nuclear holocaust? And after all the major nations are destroyed, there'll just be tribes in the jungles that rise up and survive? That jungle warfare is gonna rule the world? Yeah, maybe. It's inevitable, right? Please don't pick up. - Hello? - Hank - Is that you? - Yeah. - Still haven't left the house yet, huh? - I'm getting ready to leave. Good. Please hurry. Stop calling me so I can put on my damn socks. Will do. I'll stop calling. I am. I am getting out there. Well, no, I've asked a lot of girls to dance, mom. They're just It's not Listen to me for a second. Yes, I shaved the back of my neck. Oh, my god. Mom, I gotta go. One of my friends is getting beaten up by some girls! Actually, it's kind of too bad we're not coming into work tomorrow. Why? I bet Michael had some elaborate theme party planned, like scrambled egg saturday. More like, "Hey, everyone, let's get your boss laid" saturday. I have an announcement to make. I am moving to Costa Rica. Thought about it for a long time now. And I'm finally gonna do it. So I'm just gonna hop the fence and jog home then. - Those girls really welled on you bad. - Why wouldn't they let me dance? Okay, I gotta go. Do not take him to a hospital. - Pretty weird. - Do you have to go with them? I do, I have to go. - Stay, please. - Okay, no. I have to go. Good luck against Con-college. Call me. I'm not gonna call her. - I don't wanna go back in. - I know. Here we go. Cleaning people. Oscar? All you need is explain what happened 'cause I think they can help us. Why are you assuming they only speak spanish? I just If they speak spanish. Good evening. We locked ourselves in. Okay? It happens they speak spanish. Lucky us. This is a one time thing. You know that, right? - This is it. - All right! This is where the magic happens. - Nice! - Very nice. One of you can have the sofa, and one of you can have the floor. - I got the sofa. - I got sofa. Dwight, I got up the sofa I'm the boss. - I got floor! - If anybody needs to go to the bathroom I don't wanna get my head stepped up. Do you want me to sing you a song my mother used to sing me - when we were sick? - No. - Leave him alone. - It's a lullaby. Ryan? - Why don't you take your clothes off? - No! Guys I think my friend Troy might have a drug problem. What do I do? I think his species might have a higher tolerance than ours. Here's what you do. You tell him that you're his friend, and that you're going to help him, and that everything's gonna be all right. And then you put a wire on him and you find out who's selling him drugs. And then you get that guy and you flip him. You turn him into a snitch. You follow that guy to the people really, really bad. I've been watching The Wire recently I don't understand a word of it. I wanna sleep. You can leave the light on if you want, but please stop talking, okay? Okay. Good night, Ryan. Good night, Ryan. Best night ever. Like I said, it's not about the horniness. It's about the loneliness. And how can I be alone here with my boys? Like a famous person once said, "boys on the side." But I don't I disagree. I say, let's hear it for the boys. Son of a bitch. Everybody, everybody, listen up. I need your ideas now. Ideas, please, right now. Go, go! - Come on! - What you're talking about? Wet cement outside, it's drying fast. Come on, this is a lifelong dream. What do I write? Michael, you could put your initials in it. M.G.S., no. Some idiot named Mark Greg Sputnik will claim credit for it. I don't Once in a lifetime opportunity, people. - Come on! - Well Here we go! Phyllis, yes? - When I was a little girl - Okay. Okay, do it! Come on, great, let's hear it! - We found some wet cement - It's drying, it's drying. All right, Phyllis, come on! - Come on, Phyl! - What did we write? Aah! Come on! - Draw a picture. - No! - 'Cause that says so more than words. - No, no! Come on, give me something good! I was watching E!, and I saw Will Smith outside the chinese theater, - and, oh, my god, he looked so good. - Pam, translate. She's talking about the handprints that celebrities make in cement. - I love it! - A real star would put his face in it. - I love it more! - Michael, that doesn't seem safe I love it! Come on, let's go! We are here today not to immortalize a man, but an idea. Maybe the idea of a man. Hurry, please. Greatness is only skin-deep some people say. Well, that's not true. Other people believe it's deeper inside and in this case, that's also not true. Go! Force it in as deep as you can. That's what she said. Today's a very special day for me. And it's really not about me. It's about my grandkids. It's about my great-grandkids. I can come back here when I'm 100, and I can find that piece of cement and say, "That's me. Look, kids. Your daddy left that facehole." I don't know. It's a good feeling. Episode 4x12 "DID I STUTTER" (1.00) Okay Adjective. Tall. No, no, uh, nice. Good one. Okay You ready? "The tall man entered the nice building, "to visit a very nice man. "Sit down, Mr. Smith. "Can I interest you in any good cat food?" It's a man eating cat food! What about a cat eating man food? Andy and Angela seem very happy. I hope nothing horrible ever happens to them. Yeah, I slept over at a friend's house, and I forgot my contact solution, so I had to wear my back-up glasses. Shut up. All right, everybody. Oh, my god. Pam Those make you look so ugly. Pam, in order to get hotter, you take the glasses off. You're moving in the wrong direction. - I don't have my contact - Blah blah! I can't even hear you. It's just noise coming out of an ugly scientist. We're gonna have a little brainstorming session in the conference room. Energize. You know what would energize me? If you, Pamela Morgan Beesly Don't, don't. If you propose to me during the Michael meeting, I will say no. Well, it's too late, 'cause I'm proposing that you get me a cup of coffee, which would energize me greatly and make me the happiest man in the world. Everybody, so how are we going to energize our office? I mean, I haven't done anything since Christmas. Pam clearly has just given up trying. So what we need to do is we need to get things going. We need to get percolating a little bit. Anybody have any ideas what we could do? Any suggestions? Yes, Andy? What if we changed our outgoing answering machine message so it just had a little more zing and a little more pep? Zing and pep. Those are the kind of words we're looking for. Yes, Jim. What about if we did an even newer voicemail message that had even more zing and pep? Now we're cooking, I like this. Maybe a whole theme. - Like a rap a rap rhyme. - An urban thing. An urban Yeah, Stanley, you wanna help us out with that? - Stanley! Earth to Stanley. - Not me. Yes, you. Come on, Stanley, put your little game down - and join the group. - No. - Stanley, we're having - Leave me alone, damn it. We're having a brainstorm session Did I stutter? Good. This is good. I'm going to grab a glass of water. Can I talk to you a second? What? I really think that you need to address what happened with Stanley this morning. What are you blabbering about? Nothing happened. Well, you know, Stanley was openly insubordinate. - That, in the conference room? - Yeah. We were joshing around, the two of us. And he said, "Did I stutter?" And I said, "wh-wh-wh-what, dog?" It was joking, Toby, all right? He didn't seem like he was joking. Well, you don't get it, because Stanley is a beautiful, sassy, powerful black man, and you're you. If you had any friends, you would understand. Friends joke with one another. "Hey, um, you're poor." "Well, hey, your mama's dead." That's what friends do. It's You're so white. All right. Well If you really believe that Stanley was joking - Why don't we go ask him that? - Okay, I will. I'm not feeling very well right now, though. My stomach hurts, so I may be going home early today. You know, Michael, sometimes my daughter's stomach hurts when there's a mean girl at school. Well, sometimes my stomach hurts when you come into my office. So it's probably psychological. You meet a lot of ladies driving an Xterra, because you pull up to a stop light and look over and there's an Xterra next to you, they're always driven by chicks. So there's your ice breaker. Scratch! That's a racing stripe. - Bumper's sagging. - Hmm, I doubt that very much. This car is crap. I will buy it for next to nothing. - How next to? - Well, here are your options. You can sell it for parts. Drive it off a cliff. You can donate it to a person that you'd like to see die in a car crash, or you can sell it to me and I'll use it as I would a wagon on my farm. It will be towed by a donkey. - I have to pick one of those? - Yes. - Can you go over those options again? - You know what? You knock $1,500 off the price right now and I will take it off your hands. It's gonna be now. - I have the blue book value - Seal the deal. Let's do this thing. Three, two, one. - Can I think about it? - Five, four, three, two, now. - Let me think about it. - Say it. Do it now. Do it now! Do it. Shake my hand. You will sell me this car. Shake my hand. Yeah, all right! What? I see that you gave me that form that I asked you to give me, Stanley the manly. So thank you for that. I guess we are back to normal. What are you talking about? Well, you know, the thing that you said earlier that you didn't mean. And that I forgive you for. The whole thing's silly, isn't it? Friends don't need to apologize to friends as far as I'm concerned. So we are cool. I am not going to apologize to you. It's like I used to tell my wife. "I do not apologize unless I think I'm wrong "and if you don't like it, you can leave." And I say the same thing to my current wife, and I'll say it to my next one too. Jim is in charge of Stanley only in sales-related matters. Hence the green line. Green for money. Sales, get it? There's this yellow zigzag that does give Ryan the authority to discipline Stanley. - Great. - However, in so doing, it zigs past your name, hence zagging you and making you appear weak. Thus the yellow color. Yellow for cowardly. What's the pink? Menstrual cycles. Okay. Is there anybody up here, anybody at all that can deal with this - other than me - You. Well, there is the emergency disaster mode for the org chart. This gives me full authority over every single person in the office. - I never said you could do that. - All you have to do is say it. - Okay, I'll think about it. - Say it. Just do it. Don't think, say it. Do it. Five, four, three, two Do it. Give me control. Michael I promise to give authority back to you when this crisis is over. Do it, Michael. Do it. Hey. This office needs a strong man. Say it. - No. - So All right, well then, you're gonna have to deal with this yourself. Hey, Pam. I really like your glasses. Thanks. All the girlfriends that I've ever had have worn glasses. Okay. Yeah, it's kind of a turn-on for me actually. - I should probably get back to - Like librarians. - entering the - Could you just say, "These are due back thursday." No. Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam. Okay, go ahead. A lot of jazz cats are blind, but they can play the piano like nobody's business. I'd like to put the piano in front of Pam without her glasses and see what happens. I'd also like to see her topless. - Mike. - Hey. - I'm very busy here, man. - Darryl Have you ever been in a gang? Why? It's an advice question, and if you don't want to talk about it, I completely understand. It's - No, no. - I know it's very personal. No - I have. - I knew it. Okay. Who are we talking about here? - Crips, bloods? - Both. - God. - Yeah, them and the latin kings. - The warriors, Newsies. - Okay. Okay, so dig this. You're on the street and one of your gang disses you. - Oh, my goodness. - Yeah, right. What do you do to get him to make it right? Well, see in the gang world, we use something called fluffy fingers. What is that? That's where if somebody really gets in your face, you know, just start tickling them. - Really? - Yeah. And he starts tickling you. You know, pretty soon you're laughing and hugging. Before you know it, you've forgotten the whole thing. Y'all can just go to church together and get an ice cream cone. I would have never thought that gangs would be tickling each other. Well, it's effective. I think it's self-explanatory. Hey, Jim! Come here for a second. Can you answer me something as a true Eagles fan? Oh, boy. How do you live with a franchise this bad? - On a wing and a prayer mostly. - All right, whatever you say. Listen, while I have you here with Toby, I need to give you a formal warning about your job performance. A formal warning? It's actually not a joke. I know how you spend your time here. I know how little you care about your job. And honestly, if you spent as much time selling as you do goofing around with Dwight and hanging out at reception, we wouldn't be having this conversation. I'm sorry, is this because I talked to Wallace about your website? Because I really didn't mean to go over your head. This is nothing to do with that, all right? I always appreciate constructive criticism about my job performance. I thrive on it. Then do you mind explaining it a little better? - 'Cause I'm not sure - Don't get all defensive, okay? It's just a warning. If you want details, Toby can provide them. You take it easy, all right? I'd say all the goofing around at Pam's desk and hanging out with Pam has finally caught up to him. P with Pam. Hey, what happened? What did Ryan want? Oh, we were just talking about bureaucratic stuff. Because you're very important. Yeah. Oh, what's Dwight up to? Oh, probably nothing. What the hell is this all about? You're flipping my car for profit. It's my car now. I gave you a deal based on what you said to me. Yeah, well seller beware. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got to monitor a three-way bidding war for my car on ebay. I've got a mad lib for you. "A stupid idiotic numbskull "named Andy Bernard sold his Xterra "to a smart and capable man named Dwight. "This is shaping up to be an awesome day for Dwight." Okay, everybody, shh! Listen up. Earlier today, Stanley sassed me. And Toby gave me some suggestions on how to discipline him. They didn't work, obviously, because they were stupid. So I am now going to fake fire him. - What does that mean? - It's like a mock execution. - That's not a good idea. - Yes, it is a good idea. It's the only possible solution I have left. - Well, you can actually fire him. - No - I've had enough of you. - Why are you telling us this? Because I want you to behave as if I'm actually firing him, Oscar, okay? Michael, if you hadn't told us this, then we would've thought that you were actually firing him. I'm not firing him! I will need you to act like I am firing him. Just what I'm going to do is I'm going to pretend that I'm firing him. And I need you to act like I am firing him. Do you get that? Do you get it? I'm teaching him a lesson. He needs to learn humility, all right? That's all I'm Okay, here he comes. Let's just play act. Stanley, may I talk to you for a second? Stanley Hudson, you are fired. Are you serious? I am serious. We are all serious. You are fired like a heart attack. You're firing me over three words? - Yes. - Have you lost your mind? Do you think I'm gonna let you do this to me? I've watched you screw up this office for ten years, and I'm filing a lawsuit, and I'm gonna tell them about every stupid thing - you've ever done up in this office. - All right, okay. You know what? Now you know how I feel. This was a fake firing. Lesson learned. Good work, everybody. Very nice. So I'm not fired. That's it. And do you have anything to say to me? Yes, I do. You are out of your damn little pea-sized mind. What is wrong with you? Do you have any sense at all? Do you have any idea how to run an office? Every day you do something stupider than you did the day before. And I think, "There's no possible way he can top that." But you do you do? You find a way, damn it, to top it. You are a professional idiot Hey, stop it! Okay, everybody out. - Who? - Yeah, everybody except Stanley. Let's go. - I can't find my glasses. - You know what? Take my hand, and leave 'em and let's get out of here. Okay, okay. It's Michael versus Stanley, and it is the clash of the titans. In one corner, you have Michael, and he is mad. And then in the other corner, you have Stanley, and he's mad. So that's about it. I don't understand why you keep picking on me. - Oh, for the love of god. - You just do, and I don't know why, so please help me understand. Fine. Here it is. You are a person I do not respect. The things you say, your actions, your methods and style. Everything you would do, I would do it the opposite way. Well, Stanley, maybe you are feeling that you don't respect me because you don't know me very well. Michael, I've know you a very long time. And the more I've gotten to know you, the less I've come to respect you. Any other theories? All right, you don't respect me. I accept that. But listen to me. You can't talk to me that way in this office, you just can't. I am your boss. Can't allow it. Fair enough. I am a good person, and sometimes good people don't get no respect. Rodney Dangerfield. Hey, I don't get no respect. No respect at all. When I was in the sandbox as a kid, I got no respect. My wife likes to talk after sex. So she called me from a hotel room, said, "I don't respect you." Thoughtless. You know what don't get no respect? Airplane food. Why don't they just make the plane out of the airline food? My wife don't get no respect. Some take her, please, for example. If you don't get no respect, you might be a redneck. Respect is nice. Borat. What's the deal with grape nuts? No grapes, no nuts. I don't get no respect. So I'm thinking as a reward for our loyal clients that we contact their assistants and we find out where they live. And then, we go to their houses in the middle of summer and go caroling. It is a summer Christmas celebration and we'll call it, "A summer sales a lot." Feedback, anybody? Stanley? Has the potential to be the best idea yet That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Damn it. All right, everybody out except Phyllis. Hey. Ready? Come on! Show me excited. - Yes! - Yeah. I'm pretty excited too. Today I'm headed over to the Job Fair at Valley View High School to find some new interns. Wanna get some fresh blood youthanize this place. - We doin' this thing? - Yeah. Oh, my god, Darryl. You look like Barack Obama. Everybody, I'm dating Barack Obama. - Why you dressed like that? - Like what? Like you're applying for a loan. Maybe he's going to church. Or court. Figured I'd look presentable. You went a different way. - You look nice. - Thank you. Here's what we're going to do. I'm going to instruct the kids about management and sales. Oscar will be in charge of accounting. Pam will be eye candy. No, and also because that is your alma mater. Darryl will hire some kids for the warehouse. No need to worry with them because they definitely ain't goin' to college. What college did you go to, Mike? Let's go! Today I am meeting a potential client on the golf course because Ryan put me on probation. You remember Ryan. He was the temp here. Yeah. And It is not a good time for me to lose my job since I have some pretty big long-term plans in my personal life with Pam that I'd like her parents to be psyched about. So I am about to do something very bold at this job that I've never done before Try. Mr. Maguire. It's been a couple of years. Hey, Jim, how are ya? Nice to see you, man. Oh, no! No, no, no, no, no. My grandfather would be spinning in his urn if he knew that I was out here with a Dartmouth boy. You take that shirt off right now, or I will take it off for you, sir. I am totally and completely kidding! Andy Bernard. Cornell, '95. Phil Maguire, Dartmouth, '74. - Got some blisties. - Yeah, you do. Hit about 1,200 balls last night in preparation for today, so hands are a little tender. It's actually not funny at all. It's incredibly painful. Let's make it interesting. Say 10 bucks a hole? - Great. - What are we talkin'? Skins? Acey deucy? Bingo bango bongo? Sandies, barkies, arnies? Wolf? What? I'm gonna take this petty cash that I got from Oscar and turn it into next month's rent. So many memories in this old gym. Pretending I have PMS so I didn't have to play volleyball. Pretending I have PMS so I didn't have to play basketball. Those were the days. Little over the top, don't you think? Show 'em what you brought, Mike. - That's all we brought. - This is all we need. - We'll see. - Yes, we will see, Oscar. We will see, because a blank sheet of paper equals endless possibilities. Conceptual. All right. We are open for business. Hello. - Andy, you're up. Let's go. - Giddy-up. Let's do this. People assume I'm great at golf, but like everybody, I hated golf lessons when I was a kid, so I used to just hang out with the sailing club instead. Got my knot on. Damn it! Guys, do we have to stay all day? I mean, Michael's gone. Can't we just go? Yeah. And I finished my work months ago. Excuse me, people. It has come to my attention that some of you have forgotten who is in charge here. When Michael is gone, Jim is in charge. When Jim is gone, Andy and I are in charge. When Andy is gone, you answer to me. Okay? Excuse me, where do you think you're going? Oh, no, no. You're not leaving. No! Stanley. Do not walk out that door! If you walk out that door, so help me, I will He left. Last time I checked, the american workday ends at 5:00 P.M. You will all stay at your desks until that time or you will suffer the consequences. What consequences? I will tell on you. There's some filing, restocking the supply shelves, replacing the water jug, which nobody likes to do. We - eat a lot of cake. - Cool. Yeah, and you know, you basically, you learn how an office runs. - Hello. - So Hi. Can I talk to you for a sec? - Excuse me. - This is Michael, my boss. Justin. Hey remember what we talked about in the car on the way out? "Only the best and the brightest"? He's nice, and he seems interested. He's totally wrong, Pam. - Hi. - How you doin'? Listen, I don't think that a handsome, funny, smart, funny-looking kid like you should limit himself. You could do whatever you wanna do. You could be a classy janitor or a cashier with dignity or a migraine worker. Maybe for you, paper should be more of a hobby. - Sorry for wasting your time. - Oh, no problem. And he signed! He put his name on the piece of Okay, that was supposed to be a blank canvas on which to put their hopes and dreams, and he just made it into a stupid piece of paper. We need another one immediately. Yeah. The booth is lame without it. - I only brought the one. - Are you mental? Michael, do you remember you specifically told me to only bring one sheet of paper? You said it only takes one sheet to make a difference. And I said, "Are you sure, Michael?" And you said, "Pam, Pam, Pam." And then you sneezed in my tea. And then you said, "Don't worry. It's allergies." Do you remember that? I don't. Okay. I'll go look for another one. And that is why I need a smart intern. So how's the direct mail business going? I can't complain. People love their junk mail. Now, are you gettin' all your paper from PPC, or You know what, Jim? I'm not really looking to change things up right now. I just came out here to get out of the office, so why don't we just play, okay? Absolutely. Will do. So I guess I'll just work on my short game. Hello, there. What is this company? Well, it's funny that you should ask, because it's really - more than a company. - Dunder Mifflin. Paper. - Thanks. - It Okay Damn it, Oscar! Yeah, I'm trying to lure these kids into my booth. But kids are very wary of being lured these days. Thank you, dateline. Thank you. - Extension 128. - Hiya, pumpkin. It's Creed. Say we're gonna ditch this bitch You in? - No. - You out? Pumpkin's out! Let's go, gang. My old art room. Oh! Maybe it's still here. No. No, they must have taken it down. Never mind. - What do you want? - Michael, I know you're swamped. I just thought you should know that everyone in the office has left except for Angela and I. Do not worry, though. I have taken down their names, and I have docked them a personal day. Who cares? I'm not there, neither's Jim. Why should they have to be there? So what else is up? Mich Thank you! Wha What is this? - Piece of paper. - This isn't Dunder Mifflin paper. It's some sort of Pendleton crap. I think they'll get the spirit of it. Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam! We're dying here. I want you to go back to the office, and I want you to get the real stuff. I want you to get ultra white card stock. - Are you serious? - Yes. And don't call me Shirley. Okay. Ah, damn it! You could just pick it up, take the triple bogey. Yeah, I I'll get it out. Thank you. Yep. Come on, Tuna! Hey. Can't really talk now. What's up? Just checkin' in. How's it going? You know. We'll see. We'll see. I just drove 20 miles round trip back to the office to get Michael a single sheet of white paper. So I could have just had them fax it to me, I guess. Oh, I like you. Talk to you later? Yeah, all right. Bye. All right. I'm sorry, I got to annoy you one more time. What if I bring down shipping costs? You can try. But I looked at your prices. Even with free shipping doesn't work. It's just it's not in the stars, Jim. Six. - Yeah - All right, race to the next hole! Winner gets ten bucks. Wait wait for me! - Andy! - Shortcut! Shortcut! I fell in the sand trap. All of these jobs suck. I would rather live jobless on a beach somewhere off the money from a large inheritance than to have to work in any one of these crapholes. They suck. Hey. Game over.

So let me just get my last shot in there. - Is there anything you can do for me? - I'll tell you what. My fiscal year ends in two months. Let's talk then. - Sound good? - Absolutely. Good playing with you guys. You know, it's a tough thing seeing a grown man take six shots to get out of a sand trap, but I had to give Phil credit for not quitting. Which is what I told him. I also told him that I don't quit either and I'd call him every single day until he gave me his business. Which he then did, after So I am now his paper supplier.

Nice job. - Thank you. You know what? Screw this. Today I did something stupid. I questioned myself, and I'll never do that again. 'Cause I look at somebody like Jim Halpert, and I think that guy can do anything he wants to do. He could do anything, and he chooses to work here selling paper. Just like me. Yeah. Kiss her. Kiss her good. - Hi. - Hello. I was just wondering what kind of jobs do you guys have? - Are you interested in graphic design? - Yeah. - Can I fill out an application? - Absolutely. Here. Take a seat. I should let you know right away this is just an entry level job. It's really basic. We're looking for like a self-starter, someone who can meet deadlines and just pretty much just go the extra mile. - I can do that. - Great, and Obviously, we're looking for someone who knows Photoshop and Dreamweaver, Corel Painter, Illustrator, After Effects All the basics. I don't know any of those. It's actually not super-complicated. I'm sure there's some sort of, like, adult education classes in the area. But if you're really serious, one thing about New York or Philadelphia They got amazing programs out there for design. - New York or Philadelphia. - Yeah. All right. Cool. Well, thanks. - And I'll look into those. - You should. - New York or Philadelphia. - Absolutely. - That's where the action is. - Thanks. Hello, this is Dwight Schrute. - Hello? - Hello, this is Dwight. Hello? Hello? Yes, we do have that. Hold on one second. - Jim what are you doing? - And how many would you like? - Hang that up right now. - I can get that out to you immediately. It's an imposter. Don't do business with him, this is not Dwight Schrute. Dwight left his cell phone on his desk. So, naturally, I paired it to my headset. Okay, fine, I'll just let it go to voice mail. - Hello, this is Dwight. - Hey, is this Dwight? - Yes, it is. - Oh, my goodness, you sound sexy. Thank you. I've been working out. You're not talking to Dwight right now. You're talking to Jim. Pam, I'm over here. I'm confused. Disconnect that right now. - You give me your earpiece. - I can't do that. Unsanitary. You know what, fine. I will reprogram my phone to go to my office phone. Done. This is Dwight. And I forwarded his desk phone to mine. Oh, hello, mater. Good news, I've married. Tell fater. Such a nice woman. Episode 4x14 "GOODBYE, TOBY" (1.00) Today is Toby Flenderson's last day. I couldn't sleep last night. I came in extra early. So much energy. There are certain days that you know you'll remember the rest of your life. And I just have a feeling that today is one of those days. - Morning. - Mornin'. So here we go. Just a matter of hours now until his horribleness has left the building. I'm going to set my watch alarm And Good morning, Kelly. I can't believe this is your last day. How do you feel? Fine. Good. I feel weird. First thing on the agenda. Actually, the only thing on the agenda is that status of Toby's going away party. We have a buttercream cake and a slide show of Toby. But so far we only have two pictures of him. Okay, well, this will not do. Toby is going away forever, and we need to do something very, very special. In some cultures, when somebody leaves, like New Orleans culture, they have a parade, and they have a band. And people party in the streets. Do you mean leaves as in dies? You want us to throw Toby a New Orleans funeral? If the devil were to explode, and evil were gone forever, what sort of party would you have? - Michael - Like a beach blowout? - Or a toga - No, you know No! - Toga! - You always do this. We have a nice, modest party planned, and you come in and demand the world. Let me be clear. There is simply no money for anything other than a cake, and to develop a few more slides. Although Toby won't be in them. I thought that you might say that. Every year, my sweet, sweet grandmother sends me a check on my birthday for $50. And lately she has been sending me, like, nine or ten checks a year. As Nana starts to But I knew I should be saving it for something. I just didn't know what I should be saving it for. And then I had an awakening. Michael, buy a motorcycle. So I put the money in my shoe, and then I forgot about it until now. I want a party that makes me feel like I'm flying through the air without this ugly weight holding me down. You know? I want an antigravity machine. I saw it in a movie. You drink a potion, and then you just start floating all around. So how much antigravity potion do you want? No, you know what? This is not a party-planning committee anymore. And I don't want your foot money, and I feel uncomfortable participating. Phyllis. Can you do this? Yes. - Hi, can I help you? - Hi, yes. I'm Holly Flax. I was told to ask for Mr. Flenderson. As part of my last day, I'm training the new human resources rep in the ways of the company. Again, the company has allotted for this training one day. So this is H.R. This is your desk. I love the view. Yeah, it's great, isn't it? Hey. Hey. What? Guess who just got into the Pratt school of design. No way! What'd I say? I said that they'd love those sketches. - Congrats. - Oh, thank you. I don't know why I doubted it. Because I'm so clearly awesome. Yes. So when do you start? I didn't read it carefully. I just saw "congratulations," and skimmed the list. I saw my name, I came in here to tell you and get a snack. Busy morning. So you know, it means I have to go to New York for three months. It's not a big deal. I'll come visit you. And you'll visit me. It's only two hours away. It'll be fine. - It's gonna suck, but it'll be great. - Yeah, it sucks, but it'll be great. See how easy that is? I wouldn't go if things weren't so solid with Jim. And down the road, if we have a family, I couldn't go then either. So the timing's perfect. And that is the first time I've ever used the word "perfect" in here. Hey, Stanley. I want to introduce you to Toby's replacement. So what do we know about her? Well, we know that Toby thinks she'll be great. Oh, strike one. I hate her already. I hate her too. Why do you hate her? Because she stinks with her ways and her head. You know, Dwight, sometimes I don't know, I think you say things just to agree with me. - Would that be such a bad thing? - Yeah, it would. Just have a thought. Have an original thought! Although I will agree that her head is weird. - You know what we need to do? - What? - We need to sell her an elevator pass. - But our elevator doesn't require a Exactly. A little old-fashioned hazing. Hi, are there any local companies that rent antigravity machines? - Antigravity machines? - That's right, yeah. What do they do, exactly? They make you feel lighter. Antigravity Antidepressant? I could put you through to someone on that. Okay. Yeah. - Hey, Michael? - Oh, hey, do you still work here? I'd like to introduce you to my replacement. - Come on. - No. I think I'll pass. Michael Scott, this is Holly. - Hi. - Hi, yeah, right. Okay, well, they hired a female Toby. Good for the world. Thank you, god, for creating two of you. Here's how things work here. My job is to make the office fun, your job is to make the office lame. And we have an eternal struggle, you and I. And only one of us can be the winner. Spoiler alert I'm gonna win. Man, someone doesn't like H.R. Yeah. - What did you do to him? - Nothing. T No, he tortured me with his awfulness. Yeah, I know what you mean. I nearly fell asleep when he gave me a tour of the files. Well, look, I'll let you get back to work, but I really look forward to working with you, Mr. Scott. You can p Michael. Thanks to Toby, I have a very strong prejudice against human resources. I believe that the department is a breeding ground for monsters. What I failed to consider, though, is that not all monsters are bad. Like E.T. Is Holly our extraterrestrial? Maybe. Or maybe she's just an awesome woman from this planet. - The pleasure is all mine. - Oh, thanks. I'm really looking forward to sitting down with you and finding out more - about what you do here. - Any time. What do you do here? Excuse me. What is wrong with this woman? She's asking about stuff that's nobody's business. What do I do? Really, what do I do here? I should have written it down. "Qua" something. Qua Quar Quibo Qual Quir Quabity. Quabity assuance. No. No, no, no, no. But I'm getting close. Have you been introduced to Kevin? No. Which one's Kevin? He's here on a special work program. He's slow, you know, in his brain. - Oh, good for you guys. - Yeah Hazing is a fun way to show a new employee that she is not welcome or liked. Accounting department, listen up. Holly, human resources. - Angela, Oscar, and Kevin. - Hello. Hello. Hi. Hi. What do you do? I do the numbers. Oh, good for you. Do you want an M&amp;M;? Oh, no, that is so sweet. But thank you, though. Yeah, I keep them here at my desk so that everybody doesn't take them. Well, that is a very safe place for them. - Yeah. - Here she is. Holly. You know, if we hung Holly from the ceiling, we'd have to kiss underneath of her. So I know. Sorry. Question. Are you real, or are you a Hollygram? Nice. I've never heard that one before, actually. - That's good. - I bet. Are these guys boring your ears off? No, no, I What is your commute like? How long does it take to get in? You know, I should make you a mix. Do you have a CD player? Yeah. - All right. - Thanks. Great. Do you like it? It's a photo of everyone in the office. So you can take it to Costa Rica. - You're You're not in it. - Well, I was taking the picture. I love it. I love it. I would love a picture of the two of us to also take to Costa Rica. - Sure, do you have a camera here? - No Does anyone have a camera here? No one has a camera here. I'm gonna I'll go get one. Stay. So I just got the fax. Closing the sale, and it's big. - It is really big. - Congratulations. Don't interrupt. Congratulations on doing your job. - You put the sale on the web site? - No, I didn't. I just logged it in. Try to be a team player here, Jim. Log it in the web site. - Well, it already went through, so - Don't worry about that. Just re-log it. Hello? Hike up your skirt a little more Jim? - I am downloading some n3p music - That's not it. Yeah. - for a cd mix tape for Holly. - Close. And I'm looking for perfect songs that work on two levels. What are the two levels? The two levels being welcome to Scranton and I love you. Okay, let's start with the "I love you" level. Hey, what's the group that was from Scranton that made it big? - Was that U2? - Yes. You don't love Holly. - I think I do. - But you just met her. Well, it was love at first sight. Actually, it was No. It was when I heard her voice. It was love at first see with my ears. Oh okay, it doesn't work like that. Well, you're not a romantic. Actually, I think I am, and I've a little bit of experience in office romance. - Oh, really? Like, with who? - Yeah. - We've been through this. - Pam? Yes, we are still dating. And guess what. I took it slow. Yeah, you took it too slow. - Well, we're really happy. - This thing with Holly feels a lot like love to me. And that's really sweet. And you can think that, but you don't say that out loud. And you definitely don't say it to her. I don't want her to get away. I know. Here, Michael, you can court her as you get to know her, you know? I mean, the office is a great place for that. Pam and I, we got to know each other right out there. I mean, first time we joked around was at my desk. And the first meal we ever had was in the break room, actually. We were at two separate tables and I remember that. The first time we kissed even was right outside, and Look. All I'm saying is that you can get to know someone really, really well, like I did Right here at work. I was thinking fireworks for the party. What do you think? Oh, boy, I appreciate your help, but I can't Oh, no. I just meant I wanted to pay to have fireworks at the party. Why would you do that? Because I'm gonna miss Toby. Yep, he's a heck of a guy, and I think we should send him off right. It doesn't matter. Here you go. Really? Well, we all want a good party, right? I'm going to propose tonight. Holy crap! - Hey, Kevin. - Hi. Do you need some help? I can't decide what to get. Well, what do you like to eat? Well, I like pretzels, but I really like chips. Well, how much money do you have there? Okay, let's see. This is a button. Okay, you have 75 cents. So that means you could get anything up on the top row. I am totally gonna bang Holly! She is cute and helpful, and she really seems into me. Hey, Ryan, it's Jim. I don't know what you got lately, but you know what, I really don't care because you're trying to get rid of me. And I bet you think I don't care enough about this job to actually fight back, but you're wrong, because I do, and I will. So you can keep trying to push me out of this place, but guess what I'm not going anywhere. Damn it! Hello, Holly. What are you doing? You don't You don't have to do that. I mean, we have already put-together chairs. That's how we buy them, actually. I'm trying to adjust the lumbar support on Toby's chair, and that made this up/down lever thing not work. And then I took the whole chair apart, and that is the story of me on the floor. It's pretty good, right? I'm gonna sell the movie rights. And the sequel, woman stands at desk and works. So, I have no idea how you How you sit like that. Yoga. Sit on floor and put together chair we will. Yo-da. Pass curvy metal piece you will. So are you in town this weekend?

I did it. - What'd you do? - I talked to her Holly. Just pleasantries. Nothing, you know, not like, do you want kids? Or religion or what side of the bed do you want? Hey, I can take either side of the bed at this point. - Okay, so how'd that feel? - It was hard. I wanted to kiss her. Oh, I'm so glad you didn't. Oh, god. Laying a base. - Laying a base. - There you go. There's plenty of base laying left, right? Yeah. Hello, Angela. Phyllis, you look like you're gonna have a heart attack. Could I get a list of your vendors? - I shredded it. - Why would you do that? Gosh, I just don't know. Why do you think? Sorry. What'd you guys do? Oh, there he is. Thought you had gone home already. Why don't you go home and come back for the party? Well, we still have to do the exit interview. Yes, we do. I'll let you in on a little secret. I've been looking forward to this moment. Very, very much. I I have been steeped in anticipation. Toby has been cruisin' for a bruisin' for 12 years, and I am now his cruise director. And my name is captain Bruisin'. - Thanks, Michael. I didn't expect - Can I just say that of all the idiots in all the idiot villages in all the idiot worlds, you stand alone, my friend. - Hello. - Hey! - Hi, good to see you. - You too. I'm just having a little exit interview. Yeah, I know. That's why I'm here. No, no. This is very boring stuff. Why don't you take a tour? Have you seen the bailer? No, no, I'll look at it later. It's part of my job. Okay. - Did you need me to take notes? - Hi, Pam. Stay. Okay. All right. Well then, I will proceed. I just have some questions that I was gonna ask. Who do you think you are? I'm Toby. Yeah. Correct. What gives What What gives you the right? I brought the binder. Do you wanna take a little look? Sure, you know what, that sounds good. I'll take a little looksie. - Here we go. - Thank you. "What would you improve "about Dunder Mifflin?" This place - No, no, no, no, no, no, no. - I've got some ideas. I'm not asking it, I'm just reading it out loud. Oh, I'd like to hear the answer. Well, let me see. I would I'll kill you. I guess everything's okay. I made it this far, right? What's the point? Why don't you open your present? This might not be what I think that I don't even know's in there 'cause there are a lot of presents in my car, and I don't know which is which. "Suck on this." - What the hell is that? - Michael What do you mean "Michael"?! That's not even my handwriting. Hey! What the hell is going on here?! Who thought it would be hysterical to give Toby a rock for his going-away gift?! - You did. You made me wrap it. - No! I thought it was over the line. I just You know what that is? You know what that is? That is a psyche. Psyche. So, that is not my real gift to Toby. - So what is your gift? - My gift is forthcoming, Pam. What is it? I am going to give Toby Your watch? Yes, I am. That was it. How did you know that? - I just knew. - How did you know? Oh, that is so sweet. Well That's my watch. Thanks. I'm gonna set it to Costa Rica time. Hey, that's good. Hey, it's the kid. Look, look, look. It's the temp. Look. - Oh, my gosh. - It's the temp. - Is that the police? - Yes. This is what happened. Ryan's big project was the web site, which wasn't doing so well. So Ryan, to give the impression of sales, recorded them twice. Once as office sales, and once as web site sales. Which's what we refer to in the business as misleading the shareholders. Another good term is fraud. The real crime, I think, was the beard. Oh, my god. Ryan. Oh, my god. I cannot wait to visit Ryan in prison. I'm gonna wear my hottest track suit and get my hair done. And then be, like, "Hi, Ryan." And then all the other prisoners are gonna be like, "Damn! "Ryan, you got a hot ex-girlfriend. "I would never have treated her so bad when I was outside of prison." Would you do me a favor and connect me to Ryan? Absolutely. Right to voice mail. Hey, Ryan, it's Jim. You know what? Totally disregard that last voice mail because you obviously have your hands tied. Good luck. What's protocol on this? Well, I normally do nothing, I guess. You shouldn't Michael, are you okay? I'm just worried about my friend. Of course you are. Just I'm fine. I'm holding it together. I have a business to run. I'm cool. No, hey, stop. You can let yourself be upset. He's your friend. You know what I usually find? Holly is sweet and simple. Like a lady baker. I would not be surprised to find out that she had worked in a bakery before coming here. She has that kind of warmth. I'm pretty sure she's baked on a professional level. Cool! A bouncy house! Kevin, take your shoes off first. No anti-gravity machine, huh? Sorry, Michael. I don't think they're real. The ferris wheel is pretty cool, though. Look at our parking lot. Yeah, who'd have thought? Is Jim gonna propose tonight? He is, isn't he? No, he's not. Is he? Oh, it was a pretty good company, but I just couldn't see a future there. They kept hiring from the outside. It was easy to get in, but impossible to rise up. That's what she A lot of places are like that. I think it's really cool you hired Kevin. Thanks. - You have it? - Almost. Here we go, here we go. Put it in. That that's my car. What are you doing? - What the hell's going on here?! - Nothing you need to know. - There is a raccoon in the car, Dwight! - No, there's not. - Why did you do that? - It was playful hazing. No, there's no such thing as playful hazing. Dwight, I want you to look at Holly now. Everybody, I want you to look at Holly right now. And maybe if you look at her deeply enough, you'll see what I see in her. And that is that we are all very lucky to have her here. Holly is the best thing that has happened to this company since World War II. She is the best. - Take care of that, all right? - It's not rabid. - Thanks for bringing that up. - Get it out, come on, get it out. I'm really sorry. Michael, thank you so much for saying that. I feel so welcome here. I just Excuse me. Did you see that? Did you see it? Did you see what Well, Jan didn't believe in showing affection, so sometimes I don't know how to react to when a girl touches me. I like it. Mrs. Vance, we're all out. Kev, I need you to do me a solid and go buy some more barbecue sauce. Okay. Cool. You drive your own car? Yup, this is my car. Do you drive your own car? Yep, just like you. Okay, bye. Bye. I'm really proud of you. All right. Let's hear it for Darryl and his band. You know what? Let's also give a shout out to Phyllis for this awesome party, huh? Probably the best one that we have ever had, right? But the real reason that we are here is to say good-bye to a guy who we will probably never ever see again. Now, a lot of you know that I am an accomplished songwriter. Song parody writer. I have done things like Beers in heaven. - Classic. - Or Total eclipse of the fart. - Not my favorite, but - I love to sing them, but I am not going to be doing that today.

No, I brought my money. There's something that you need to see. - What is it? - Just hurry. - Is he okay? - Yeah, he needs me at the supermarket. The party, driving to the supermarket It was a big day for him. Yeah, that's true. Don't move a muscle. I will be back momentarily, all right? No, you can Finish your drink and then I'll I'll be back. - It was good to see you. - It was great to see you, Jan. Okay. - Hello, Jan. - Hello Michael. Kevin, really? We're Sorry, we're in the middle of a party. Is this why you called me? Yeah, Michael, I just I think you kids have a lot to catch up on. - Oh, okay. - Yeah. Thanks, Kevin. I can't believe it! Look at you! - Are you nauseous? - No. Do you Do you have cravings? You never touched my Propecia or my Accutane? - No, I didn't touch that. - Good. Thank god. 'Cause that's Wow, I'm so happy. I am so deliriously happy. - Why? - Because you're pregnant. And because it obviously happened when we were together, and - I am very proud - Yeah, it did happen when we were together. That's true. But you are not You're not the dad. You cheated on me? - When I specifically asked you not to? - No, I did not I did not cheat on you. I did not. Well okay. Okay. So it's not mine, and it's not somebody else's, so I know the whole toilet seat thing is a myth, so I went to a sperm bank. You did? - When we were going out? - Yeah. I don't understand. You always used to be very cautious. - I'd wear two condoms. - I know. You'd rather have somebody else's sperm than mine? No, no, no. It's not just any sperm bank. I mean, it's really This is a really, really great place. It's amazing, actually. I'm gonna bring you the catalogue. You should look through it. It's And it's a fact, it's right next to that little breakfast place that you like in the city where you can draw on the tables. Ihop. Ihop. If I was 22 and I had lots of time to have lots of children, then sure, let's let Michael have a shot at one. But honestly, I need to make this one count. That's really good. I feel so much better. I just needed to get all of that out onto the table. I'm glad you told me. I don't know what you're gonna be doing tomorrow, but I have my lamaze class in Allentown. And you could come. I usually, you know, use a foam noodle instead of a partner. I've to think about it. Okay. My whole life, I have known two things. I love sex, and I want to have kids. And I always thought that those two things would go hand in hand. But now, I think it might be one or the other. Oh, look they're starting. Well, I hope you had fun today. 'Cause you're never ever throwing a party again. Can I have your attention, please? I was waiting for the right time to do this, and I can't think of a better time than right now, with the music playing, and all our friends around, and the fireworks going off. My parents are here Andrew and Ellen Bernard. Thank you for sharing in this joyous moment. Miss Angela Martin, will you please join me onstage? Okay, then I will come to you, my flower. Damn it! Angela Will you do me the honor Of giving me your tiny hand in marriage? Okay. Into the mike, sweetie. I said okay. She said yes! And the crowd goes wild!
