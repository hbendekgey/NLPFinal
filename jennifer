It is Friday morning and it is another beautiful day in Scranton, Pennsylvania. (GASPS) Oh, my God! Pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up. We have a serious problem here. All right everybody, lock the doors, turn off the lights. Pretend you're not here. Are we in danger? There's no time to think about it, this is real. Just Everybody (KNOCKING ON DOOR) KEVIN: Michael, should I call the What? The IT tech guy and me did not get off to a great start. Yeah, I tried to install it myself, but you guys have these things so password protected That just means you have to enter your password. What's your password, Michael? Uh That's Yes. (YELLING) Michael Sorry. Please don't do that. Okay, I'm sorry. What is going on in there? Why is he here? What are you doing? I can't tell you. You have to tell me. I don't have to tell you anything. Look, Michael, (SIGHING) I know you don't want to have to think about this, but if something were to happen to you, God forbid, then I would need to know in order to take over. Dwight, nothing is going to happen to me, okay? I'm in the best shape of my life. Look at this. Yeah, but that doesn't matter, you could get a brain aneurysm I'm not going to get or hit by a car Stop. or a bus or a train. You could get poisoned, fall down a well, step on a mine, choke. I'm not Okay, if I step on a mine in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and die, you can have my job, okay? Why don't you just go away? There are certain things a boss does not share with his employees. His salary, that would depress them. His bed. And I am not going to tell them that I'll be reading their e-mails. So how do you search? By keyword phrase. Try "profits." No, try "Michael Scott." "Michael," "boss" and "funny." Oh, my God. Wow! E-mail from Stanley. Stanley, terribly nice guy. "Sorry I didn't write back sooner. "I can't go to the game tonight because my boss, Michael, "is an ass and making me stay late." Well, Stanley's an ass. Not one of our harder workers. Hey, what's the deal, Michael? Why are you spying on our computers? Oh, no! Everybody, Oscar's gone crazy. What other ghost stories do you have for us? That I'm a robot? I will destroy everything in my path. OSCAR: Actually, we just (MIMICKING ROBOTIC SOUNDS) Actually Okay. Oil can. Oil can. Tin Man. Actually, we just got a memo from IT saying you're doing e-mail surveillance. What? No, that defeats the whole purpose. So it's true? You have access to our e-mails? You know what the problem is? I think I do. The problem is that when people hear the term "Big Brother," they immediately think it's scary or bad. But I don't. I think, "Wow, I love my big brother." I gotta erase a lot of stuff. A lot of stuff. Oh, hey. Just so you know, if you have any sensitive e-mails, they need to be deleted immediately. I know. Good. Hey! Something just happened. Dwight just told Angela that she has to delete all of her sensitive e-mails immediately. What? I know. Do you think that they're, like No. Right. No, no. (HUMMING) (EXCLAIMING DISGUSTEDLY) Maybe. It's like squishing a spider under a book. It's going to be really gross, but I have to look and make sure that it's really dead. So if you guys see anything Hey, Dwight? My friend is kind of into these two girls that he works with. Nice. One is tall and brunette, and the other one is short and blond and perky and kind of judgmental. Who do you think he should choose? Does he have access to their medical records? Um I think one of the greatest things about modern America is the computerization of medical records. As a volunteer sheriff, I can look up anyone's psychiatric records or surgical histories. Yeast infections. There are a huge number of yeast infections in this county. Probably because we're downriver from that old bread factory. MICHAEL: Meredith has an evite from Jim. Barbeque at Jim's tonight. Tonight? Wonder where my evitation is. Click on guest list. Angela, Stanley, Oscar, Meredith, Phyllis, Kevin, Creed. Must be No. Hey, Angela. How's it going? Hey. It's okay. Listen, are you bringing anyone to Jim's party tonight? No. Are we supposed to? No. I mean, I don't know. I don't think so. Excuse me. There is always a distance between a boss and the employees. It is just nature's rule. It's intimidation mostly. It's the awareness that they are not me. I do think that I'm very approachable as one of the guys. But maybe I need to be even approachabler. (CHATTERING) Are you going to eat with us? Of course. Hanging with my crew, crew that I am one of. Hanging with my cup of noodles. This is a meal in a cup. Right here. Hot, tasty. Reminds me of college. Lived on this stuff. Brain food. (GRUNTING APPRECIATIVELY) You know what I really, really miss about college? The parties. Everybody would go, the athletes, the nerds, professors. The professors would go to the parties? Yeah. They were the most fun. We always invited them. JIM: It's true, I'm having a party. I've got three cases of imported beer, karaoke machine and I didn't invite Michael. So, three ingredients for a great party. And it's nothing personal. I just think that if he were there, people wouldn't be able to relax, you know, have fun. And my roommate wants to meet everybody. Because, I'm pretty sure he thinks I'm making Dwight up. He is very real. What? Oh, yes! Thank you. Question. On the Internet, there are several different options to get to your house for the party tonight, and I was wondering Could you keep that down? Why? (WHISPERING) Because not everybody knows about the party. (WHISPERING) Like who? Who doesn't know? Michael. Why just Michael? Because it's a surprise. Is it? Oh, that's perfect. So don't tell. I won't. Okay. So, Dwight thinks that tonight is a surprise party for Michael. Really? That's great. I know. Maybe we can get him to hide and wait somewhere. Oh, man. Oh, you know, speaking of which, I was just trying to get a handle on numbers for food and stuff, so do you think Roy's gonna come, or Oh, no, he can't make it. Okay, cool. Hey, there. Hey. Almost quitting time. Yep, it's 4:00. One more hour to take care of anything you forgot to do. (CLEARING THROAT) Hey, you know, I don't know if you have any plans tonight, but if you don't, we could hang out. Oh, um I can't. You have plans? Yeah, I do. Yeah? I do, too. I do, too. You do? Big plans. I do. Yeah. Because you just said you wanted Tonight? I can't do it tonight, no. Improv class. I have improv class. Hanging out with my improv buds. Really? Yeah. That sounds like a lot of fun. Oh, it's the best. It is the best. I would not miss it for the world. But if something else came up, I would definitely not go. Improv sounds great. It is. Okay. All right. (MAN COUGHING) What? I think Stanley just coughed. Hey, Pam. Do you need me to walk you to your vehicular transport? No, thanks. All right. Oscar, got big plans tonight I'm on a call. Okay. Kevin. Big man, big man, what are you doing tonight? Where are you off to? My brother is in town and we are going to see the Alaska Film Festival Okay, all right. Hey, Angela. Rushie, rushie! Where're you rushing off to? I'm just leaving for the day. Yeah, well, duh! Where're you headed? Charity bake drive. Liar! You are a liar. No. No, I'm not! (SIGHING) Dwight! Oh, Dwight, my loyal compadre. You and I are hanging tonight. The two of us. We are celebrating our freedom and our manhood. You know what? Why don't we watch that show that you've been wanting to watch? That stupid Battleship Galaxy. Battlestar Galactica. That's Whatever stupid show you want to watch, we're watching it. I can't tonight. Unfortunately, I've got plans. I have to go to practice. Soccer practice. I didn't know you played soccer, Dwight. Clarinet. You, too, Dwight? Have fun tonight, whatever it is that you're doing, and I'll see you Monday. (WHISPERING) He has no idea. Quick announcement, everybody, if I could have everybody's attention. We do have wine in the kitchen and there is beer available on the porch. And despite what you might think it's not all for Meredith and Kelly. So please enjoy. Jim. You really think this is a good idea? A hide-a-key rock? Hey, you must be Dwight. You don't work with us. That's because Mark's my roommate. Hey, I love the Birkenstocks. Thanks. Yeah, I always keep an extra set in the car for special occasions. (WHISPERING) Jim, come here. When is the guest of honor coming? Oh, laterish. He's gonna love it. Great. Just wanna let you guys know that we will be taking the tour like I promised. Hey. Hey. Just in time. Do you wanna go on the group tour? We were just about to leave. Definitely. Well, the group tour is now leaving then. Ladies and gentlemen, just a few things that we're going to be pointing out to you today. You will be able to see both bedrooms and if we're lucky, maybe you get a chance to peek into the bathroom, who knows? I have to remind you also that flash photography is prohibited and as much as you can, please refrain from touching things. I know you might want to. Hey, is Katie coming? Actually, I haven't talked to her in a while. It's off? Is it cool if I call her? We can talk about that later. Okay, let's get right into it. I need two people for the first scene. (EXCLAIMING) Mr. Kotter! Mr. Kotter! Okay, Michael and Anybody? How about Mary-Beth? Okay. Come on. Okay, so you start us off, Mary-Beth. All right. Great. Okay. (SINGING) Detective Michael Scarn! I'm with the FBI! Think about this. What is the most exciting thing that can happen on TV or in movies or in real life? Somebody has a gun. That's why I always start with a gun. Because you can't top it. You just can't. I'm supposed to meet my doctor here. Have you seen him? He's a very angry midget. Boom! Freeze! Michael Scoon, FBI! You know what you did. (IMITATING GUN FIRING) Yeah, you thought you could get away with your little ruse, didn't you? Didn't you? Well, you didn't, because I know where you hid the diamonds. I've been onto you and your little friends for weeks. Boom! Boom! Boom! I'm not even in the scene! Boom! Boom! Boom! Stop! Stop! Stop! Okay. You shot me, okay, great. Stop. Okay. What? Why? You can't just shoot everyone in the scene. Well, if you hadn't stopped the scene you would have seen where it was going. Okay, what about the scene they set up? Boring. No, it wasn't. No more guns. It could've No, no, Michael. Why don't you give me all the guns you have? Just get rid of all your guns and give them to me. Great. Okay. Jim's bedroom. See, I knew we lost somebody on the tour. It's Cool. This is your desk? This is my desk. Your home office? Home office. This is it. Yeah. You have to sit down, so I can get the full effect. Okay, sure. Will do. Okay, wait. So that would make me, like, right here. Yeah, yeah, that feels about right. And then, Dwight would be, like You know what? Let's just leave that image out of it, because this is a happy place. Happy thoughts, Pam, happy thoughts. (GASPS) Yearbook. Yeah, you don't have to All right. Yes, that's not going to be awkward at all. Oh, no. Oh, yeah. You were so dorky. Thank you. CHRIS: Freeze. I'm in. Do you want to go over the rules one more time? No, no, no, no! I'm looking in my wallet for money so you can tell me my fortune. I promise it's worth it. I can see you walking out of here and you're thrilled with your reading. What are you Michael, what did you tell him? Nothing. Then why are his hands up? Bill? He told me he couldn't show it to me, but he has a gun. (SIGHING) Okay, let's call it a day. Nice job. Good. That was good. Good work, everybody! Angela! Burger? Dog? Having fun? I got sap on me. Chicken, hotdog, burger. I'm a vegetarian. There is soda inside. I didn't think the premium laser color-copy batch would sell as well as it did. It surprised us all. I'll tell you why, because I'm sorry, guys. Can we please not talk about paper? There's gotta be something else that we could talk about. (CLEARING THROAT) ANGELA: I think it's all right. I mean, Jesus drank wine. Hey, Phyllis. Come here for a second. Sure. Have you heard anything about any secret office romances or You tell me. You do mean you and Jim, right? Oh, God. I'm so sorry. I mean, I thought, you guys hang out all the time, and you're talking all the time And I'm sorry. I Oh, it's okay, it's okay. Not so fast, fire guy How do I get to Bernie's Tavern from here? Don't worry, we're all gonna carpool. To Bernie's, huh? We're all going to Bernie's? Sorry, we're not going as a group. It's just a private friend who happens to know all of us from different ways, is throwing a private birthday thing. Right, right, right, right. Well guys, I'd love to go to Bernie's with you, but you know what? I have an office party. Big office party I need to go to. Can't get out of it. Hey, see you later. Good job. Nice job, Bill. Not. (SINGING ALONG WITH KARAOKE) Here I go again on my own Going down the only road I've ever known Oh, hey, how's your little side project going? Oh, yeah, I gave that up. Really? Yeah, it turns out I was just grasping at straws. Just because two people are hanging out, it doesn't mean that they're together. You know, like, people can just be friends. And I think that it was really unfair of us to assume that there was anything else going on. (SINGING) Just turn around now 'Cause you're not welcome anymore and I got all my Surprise! Everybody! Wow. Who opened the morgue for this thing? I was just driving by, I thought I'd drop in. There's some wine. I would love a glass, if you're going to open it. Hello, temp, take my jacket. (MICHAEL LAUGHING) Oh, come on, that guy? He is a good guy, not a terrorist. Karaoke, I love it. I am a karaoke fiend. I call dibs, I got next. I got next up. Come on, let's get this party started! Okay, where is that wine? Okay, this is a duet, so, (ISLANDS IN THE STREAM PLAYING) I need somebody else. Pam, you wanna come up and sing this one? Need somebody else. Takers, please. (SINGING) Baby, when I met you there was peace unknown Kelly? I tried to get you with a fine-tooth comb I was soft inside There was something going on This is the part, it goes to the girl. (HIGH-PITCHED TONE) You do something to me that I can't explain Hold me closer and I feel no pain Every beat of my heart We got something going on Tender love is blind It requires a dedication All this love we feel needs no conversation Divided together Making love with each other MICHAEL: We're making love! Islands in the stream that is what we are No one in between How can we be wrong Sail away with me Talk! Just talk! I Shut up! Funny story. The way I got into improv was I got into improv The story about me getting into improv was that I was walking down the street, and a race car pulls up, and the guy says, "Hey you're funny. You're the funniest guy I've ever seen, "or my name is not Dale Earnhardt." And that was an improv. The real way was that I found a flier. DWIGHT: Kevin Malone, you're next. Spit that out. Spit. Okay, come on. Let's go. You look cute today, Dwight. Thanks, girl. So, yesterday Dwight found half a joint in the parking lot, which is unfortunate, because, as it turns out, Dwight finding drugs is more dangerous than most people using drugs. Let's go over some of these symptoms of marijuana use, shall we? You tell me who this sounds like. Slow moving, inattentive, dull, constantly snacking, shows a lack of motivation. Hey. I like the people I work with, generally, with four exceptions. But someone committed a crime, and I did not become a Lackawanna County volunteer sheriff's deputy to make friends. And by the way, I haven't. (IMITATING STANLEY) I enjoy the tangy zip of Miracle Whip. (PAM LAUGHING) Jim does the best impressions. Sometimes he'll look up at me from his desk, and he'll just be someone else. Like, he'll go That's supposed to be Phyllis. I can't do it as good as he can. And the guys are saying, "Chug! Chug! Chug!" But I'm so small and all I had eaten that day was one of those Auntie Em pretzels from the food court. So I said, "Is it okay if I sip it?" And they said, "No." But Ryan seemed cool either way Stop! This is not "Kelly Kapour's Story Hour." Illegal drugs were consumed on company property, okay? Your ass is on the line, mister! My ass is on the line! Now, I'm gonna ask you again, what time did you go home last night? I didn't know that you were at a party on Saturday night. I go to a lot of parties. Okay, I'm gonna need to search your car. Give me your keys. I am not giving you my keys. Don't make me do this the hard way. What's the hard way? I go down to the police station on my lunch break. I tell a police officer, I know several, what I suspect you may have in your car. He requests a hearing from a judge and obtains a search warrant. Once he has said warrant, he will drive over here and make you give him the keys to your car and you will have to obey him. Yeah, let's do it that way. Dwight! Is he bugging you? Dwight, dude, you gotta take a chill pill, man. It was one joint in the parking lot. You know, you're totally harshing the office mellow. I can't stop this investigation. It is my job. Whoa, you are a volunteer. I volunteered for this job. And that's not the same. It is my duty Volunteer duty. to investigate the crime scene. I have six more interviews to go, and then I will reveal what I know. (COUGHING) Narc! (SNICKERING) If you are attempting to compliment me, then you have done a very good job. I wasn't attempting to compliment you. Well, you have, because being a narc is one of the hardest jobs that you can have. Okay. And I am very proud of being Why don't you just cool it? Cool it! So Dwight, please! God! (IMITATING STONER) Dude, where's my office? I totally lost it because I was half-baked, smoking doobies! Doobie Brothers. I was smoking doobies with my brothers. Peace out, Seacrest! Well, your office is behind you. Thanks. Munchies. Who wants some munchies? I don't think Michael's ever done drugs. I don't know if anyone's ever offered him any. DWIGHT: Oscar visited Mexico, when he was five, to attend his great-grandmother's funeral. What does that mean to a United States law enforcement officer? He's a potential drug mule. Have you ever taken any illegal drugs? No, I have not. Do you think it's possible that maybe you could have had some drugs in your system without you knowing about it? What are you implying? Have you ever pooped a balloon? Okay, I'm done with this. He sure left in a hurry. I don't wanna blow this. DWIGHT: This is what all good law enforcement officers dream of, the chance to solve an actual crime. DWIGHT: Do you know what this is? Yes, it's marijuana. How do you know that? It's labeled. Damn it. That is Northern Lights, Cannabis indica. (SIGHING) No. It's marijuana. I'm just saying that you can't be sure that it wasn't you. That's ridiculous. Of course it wasn't me. Marijuana is a memory loss drug, so maybe you just don't remember. I would remember. Well, how could you if it just erased your memory? That's not how it works. Now, how do you know how it works? Knock it off, okay? I'm interviewing you. No! You said I'd be conducting the interview when I walked in here. Now, exactly how much pot did you smoke? So, Pam told me you do a great Stanley impression. I'd love to hear it. (HESITATING) OSCAR: Good. "Why do you keep cc-ing me on things that have nothing to do with me?" Is that supposed to be me? Oh, hey, Stanley. I was just doing an impression. I do not think that is funny. He does everyone in the office. Hmm. "I do not think that is funny." "I do not think that is funny." Jinx. Buy me a Coke. No, no! No talking! Jim is not allowed to talk until after he buys me a Coke. Those are the rules of Jinx and they are unflinchingly rigid. "Sold out"? That has never happened in the history of Jinx. Sorry, it's not my problem. DWIGHT: I know you're innocent, but it can't look like I'm treating you any differently. I understand. (SHOUTING) Where were you yesterday after work? MICHAEL: Uh-oh, uh-oh. Who's he calling? Ratting somebody out! Narc! Narc! Kevin. That is so good, Michael. MICHAEL: Remember the narc bit? Okay, I will let them know. Uh-oh. Who's in trouble? Attention, everyone! Drug testers are coming in a couple of hours to test everyone's urine. (LAUGHING) What? What are you talking about? Company policy. If drugs are found on the premises, there is automatic drug testing conducted within 24 hours. Is that true, Toby? When you sign your job application, you agree to comply with random drug testing. MICHAEL: Two nights ago, I went to an Alicia Keys concert at the Montage Mountain Performing Arts Center. I had scored these great aisle seats. Anyway, after the opening act, this beautiful girl sits down next to me. And I never get to meet girls with lip rings and she had one. I don't know exactly how this happened, but one of her friends started passing around some stuff and they said that it was clove cigarettes. And I'm sure that it was clove cigarettes. Everybody in the aisle was doing it. Okay, attention, everyone! The drug testing has been cancelled. Instead, I will be going around to each of you and doing a visual inspection. No, you can't do that. I can do that. It is my office! DWIGHT: No, you cannot. It has to be official and it has to be urine. All right. Okay. Kevin, what prescription drugs are you taking besides Rogaine? I'm not taking Rogaine. Angela, what about you? I don't take any prescription drugs. You're not on anything? Good. KELLY: So, the first time we went out to dinner, it was like, whatever, fine. But I was so nervous. So this time, I wanted it to be special. So I bought a new dress! One of those kinds that's kind of low-cut at the top to show something. But not everything. I mean, not everything, Jim. I promise Hey, guys. What's going on? We're just having the best conversation. Okay, well, Michael wants to see everyone in the conference room. But you know what? We have a few minutes, so you guys should definitely finish up your conversation. KELLY: Thanks. So, I was looking so hot It has come to my attention that some people here think that the use of drugs is something to laugh about. We don't feel that way. No, not at all. You were the one joking around, calling Dwight a narc. No, no. That was a test. I was testing you. And you all failed. Miserably. When I said that Dwight was a narc, how many of you defended him? How many of you said, "Hey, you know what? He's right. "What he's doing is protecting this office from the evils of drugs." Thank you, Michael. I am ridiculously anti-drug. I am so anti-drug that I am above suspicion in any way that involves suspicion or testing of any kind. Drugs ruin lives, people. Drugs destroy careers. Take Cheech and Chong. Everybody knows that Cheech and Chong are funny. But just imagine how funny they would be if they didn't smoke pot. I want everybody to take a look to their left. Now, I want everybody to take a look to their right. One of those people will be dead from drug use at some point in their lives. This year more people will use cocaine than will read a book to their children. Where did you get these facts? Are these facts scaring you or are they not? They are not. Do you think that smoking drugs is cool? Do you think that doing alcohol is cool? STANLEY: No, I don't. And I have a glass of red wine with dinner about once a week, for the antioxidants. TOBY: Yeah, I have the same MICHAEL: Okay. Enough, enough, enough! I have written down a list of illegal drugs. Take a gander. How many of these are you familiar with? Hookah is not an illegal drug, Michael. Yes, it is. No, it's not. It's a type of pipe. You can fill it with tobacco, often mixed with fruit or other flavors Okay, you know what, Toby? Pam, could you take this down? In addition to Toby's urine being tested, I would like to test his blood and his hair. You can't do that. I can test anyone randomly, and I have chosen you randomly. That's not random. Okay. Eenie, meenie, minie, moe, is random. Okay, you know what? I'm gonna need a volunteer to select one of these words and tell us of something tragic that happened in either their lives or the lives of a loved one. Yeah, Pam. I know that Jim has an amazing story about a relative of his who got caught up in the world of drugs. MICHAEL: Really? PAM: Mmm-hmm. Jim, it's okay. You can This would be a good place to let it out, Jim. These are people you can trust. These are people who care about you. It's okay. Just We will not judge you. We are here to not judge you. Oh, he's doing it. Okay. It's okay. Okay, are you sure? That looked like it was gonna be good. All right. Okay, well Wow! He really pulled out the big guns. Fake crying. I did not expect that. The point I'm trying to make with all of this, people, is that I hate drugs. I hate them! And based upon what I have seen, you all don't quite hate them as much as I do. So, you are going to have a drug test and I am not. No, you will be tested. Yes, I will Will not be. No, you will be. That is the law according to the rules. Okay, well, Dwight, just know that I've been very busy today and I've got a lot of work to do and I wasn't planning on going to the bathroom and I don't even know if anything's gonna come out. Okay? So, good. Thank you. Hi, Linda. Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager. You might remember testing my urine a few years back when I was applying to be a volunteer sheriff's deputy. We test a lot of urine. Mine was green. Oh, right. How are you? I'm all better. So, I need you to do some work on the Saint Andrews account. I need your urine, I need some filing done. What kind of filing? Just forget it. Just the urine. That goes directly to the tester. Just I need your urine. Like in a cup? Yes, in a cup. We're not animals, Dwight. For what purpose? It's none of your business. Then I refuse. Okay, all right, just I went to an Alicia Keys concert over the weekend. And I think I may have gotten high accidentally by a girl with a lip ring. Are you serious? I need clean urine for the lady. (SIGHING) But that's illegal. Don't think of it that way. It's like urine goes all over the place. You know, there's no controlling it. It just Not my urine. A cup could find its way under the urine. It might be an accident. We have Were you forced to do drugs at this concert? No, just Is something wrong? Look, just Just fill up the cup. Do you want to give Michael your urine? I want him to have all the urine he needs. You're not gonna get my permission on this. I know that. Don't you think I know that? Yeah, we do testing all over the country. Cool. Hey, are you guys hiring? You want to work at the urinalysis lab? Yeah. Maybe. (DWIGHT MOANING) My father's name was Dwight Schrute. My grandfather's name was Dwight Schrute. His father's name? Dwide Schrude. Amish. I loved my father very much. Every morning he'd wake up at dawn and make us biscuits with gravy. When I was little, my dad and I played a lot of games together. My dad cheated a lot, but I never busted him on it. I would have, except I didn't know about it. He didn't tell me till years later. And I was shocked when I found out. What? Did you wanna tell me something? You look like you want to tell me something. You look like you have something really important to say and you just can't for some reason. Come on, you can tell me. Jim, you can tell me anything. I'd like a magazine. We just need urine, sir. I'd still like one. MICHAEL: Dwight, well, I passed the test, thanks to you and your untainted pee. Thank you very much. That's great. What's wrong? Where's your costume? It's a uniform. And I turned it in today when I tendered my resignation. Why? What I took an oath when I was sworn in. And I broke that oath today. Here. Just buy it from me. I haven't talked to you in hours and it's been weird. And I really wanna know what the hell's going on with Dwight. Hi. Hey. How much time do you have left on your break? Ten minutes. Since you did such a good job with the investigation, I decided to pull a few strings, call in a few favors, and I've decided to make you official security supervisor of the branch. Really? Yes, sir. That's fantastic. Because I've always felt that the security here sucked. So, you wanna "Dwight K. Schrute, I hereby declare you an honorary volunteer corporal "in charge of assisting all activities' security." Okay. Here's your badge. Thank you, Michael. Very nice, great. Can I have a gun? No. I don't have a gun. Okay. I'll have to bring in my bo staff. I don't think so. Don't Good. Thank you, Michael. No I need to go over some details with you. All right. First of all Well, thank you. Hank. Okay. How many orange traffic cones do you have? Two. Oh, God. Wow. What a terrible day to not be able to talk. JIM: Dwight was literally carrying around his own urine and dressed like one of The Village People. Why does he do the things that he does for Michael? I just don't get it. What is he getting out of that relationship?   Hey, Ryan, can I get you a pencil from the warehouse? Oh, no, thanks. I'm good. Well, it's okay. I'm going down. Yeah. Absolutely. All right, I'll be right back. Awesome. Thank you. You're welcome. Michael, could you get me a pen from down in the warehouse? Don't mind if I do. See you in a minute. Okay! There you go, fresh from the warehouse. Hey, Michael, would you get me some coffee from the warehouse? There's coffee in the kitchen, Pam. But the warehouse coffee tastes so much better. Yeah. It's better. Okay. Great. All right, okay. I am like Bette Midler in For The Boys. Gotta keep the troops entertained. With cream and sugar? All right. So, I wanted to let you know that we lost Ed Truck. Okay, let me see if I have his cell. Is this the only reason you are calling, Jan, or does somebody miss me? Michael, Ed died over the weekend. Oh, wow. Attention, everybody! I just received a call from corporate with some news that they felt that I should know first. My old boss, Ed Truck, has died. Oh, Michael, that's such terrible news. You must feel so sad. Yes, I am. It's very sad, because he was my boss. Oh, that's a shame. Ed was a good guy. That's right. You worked with him. So did Creed. Well, I'll be in my office in case anybody wants to drop by, cheer me up. So, did you hear the news? The news that you just announced, that Ed died? Yeah. Is there anything I can do? Oh, gosh. What can anybody do, really? It's He was almost 70. Circle of life. Yeah. Oh, okay. Yeah. Okay. What's going on with Fairfield County Schools? Karen, did you generate that price list? Shoot. I will. I'm sorry. Okay, just get it done. Jim, will you make sure? Oh, yeah, definitely. Suck up! Josh, did you hear what I said? Thank you, everyone. Damn it. What's up? Oh, nothing. We're just out of Herr's chips. Oh. But don't worry about it. My snack food doesn't fall under the umbrella of your authority. That's where you're wrong. I'm your project supervisor today and I have just decided that we're not doing anything until you get the chips that you require. So I think we should go get some. Now, please. It's a real shame about Ed, huh? Yeah. Must really have you thinking. About what? The older you get, the bigger the chance is you're gonna die. You knew that. Ed was decapitated. What? Really? He was drunk as a skunk, he was flying down Route 6, he slides under an eighteen-wheeler, pop, it snaps right off. Oh, my God. That is the way to go. Instant death, very smart. You know, a human can go on living for several hours after being decapitated. You're thinking of a chicken. What did I say? That is just not the way a Dunder Mifflin manager should go, I'm sorry. Alone, out of the blue. Not even have his own head to comfort him. So I'm not exactly sure how to say this Ed was decapitated. What are you doing? You said you didn't know how to say it. I didn't He was driving on the road and he went under a truck and that's when his head was separated from the rest of him. Now, we'll let you know more as soon as I find out. Hey. Hi. If my head ever comes off, I would like you to put it on ice. I do not want to talk about this. When I die, I want to be frozen. And if they have to freeze me in pieces, so be it. I will wake up stronger than ever because I will have used that time to figure out exactly why I died and what moves I could have used to defend myself better, now that I know what hold he had me in. I don't understand. We have a day honoring Martin Luther King, but he didn't even work here. I understand how you feel, Michael, I really do. So would it be helpful to give everyone the day off? You really don't get it, do you? You don't understand these people. That is the last thing that they would want, is a day off. Well, what would you suggest? A statue. Of Ed? Yeah. I'm not sure that's realistic. Well, I think it would be very realistic. It would look just like him. No, that's not We could have his eyes light up. Could have his arms move. That is not a statue. That is a robot. I think that is a great way to honor Ed. And how big do you want this robot? Life-size. No. Better make it two-thirds. Easier to stop if it turns on us. What the hell are you two talking about? Well, we are talking about how to properly honor a man who gave his life as regional manager of this company, Jan. You know what, Michael, I have really tried with you today and I have to get back to work. Oh, do you? So You know who wished they could get back to work is Ed Truck. So call me when you feel like But Ed Truck can't having a real conversation. Goodbye.  because he is dead! Look, I gave him a 6- foot extension cord so he can't chase us. That's perfect. Okay, that is a "no" on the West Side Market. Okay, great. I think that's enough. Can I get back to work now? Wow. Never pegged you for a quitter. I am not a quitter. I will do this all day if you want. Really? I don't know about that. Yeah, all day. What are we doing? What's the game? I want in. Oh, there's no game. We're just trying to get these chips for Karen. Did you check the vending machine? Oh, the vending machines. How did we miss that? I have no idea. We went right for the copier. And then we checked the fax machine. Yeah, nothing there. Did you check your butt? Can you imagine how much blood there was? If it happened right here, it would reach all the way to reception. Probably get on Pam. Okay, that's enough. What? We do not want to hear about this. Well, you know what? I didn't want to hear about it either, Stanley, but I did and now I can't stop picturing it. He leaves work, he's on his way home His cappa is detated from his head. You have just spit on my face. Well, you know what, there's something wrong with you. There is something wrong with everybody in here because we have lost a member of our family and you don't want to talk about it. You don't want to think about it, you just want to get back to work. There are five stages to grief, which are denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. And right now, out there, they are all denying the fact that they're sad, and that's hard, and it's making them all angry. And it is my job to try to get them all the way through to acceptance and, if not acceptance, then just depression. If I can get them depressed, then I'll have done my job. I am going to throw you this ball. When you catch the ball, I want you to say the name of a person very important to you, somebody really special, who died, and then I want you to say how they died. And you may cry if you like. That is encouraged. Let me just start. Let me show you how this works. I catch the ball. I lost Ed Truck and it feels like somebody took my heart and dropped it into a bucket of boiling tears. And, at the same time, somebody else is hitting my soul in the crotch with a frozen sledgehammer. And then a third guy walks in and starts punching me in the grief bone. And I'm crying, and nobody can hear me because I am terribly, terribly, terribly alone. Excuse me, I'm sorry to interrupt. I need to see Pam. There seems to be, like, something wrong with the radiator in her car. Okay, fine, hurry back. There's nothing wrong with your car. Just thought you might want a break from the grief counseling session. Oh, I would like a break. How are you liking the new car? Great. Yeah? It sure is small. Got air bags? I think so. I don't know. I was mainly focused on the cup-holders. Well, you still aren't driving so fast, are you? Yeah. Hi, yeah. This is Mike from the West Side Market. Well, we had a shipment of Herr's Salt &amp; Vinegar Chips and we ordered that about three weeks ago and haven't Yeah. You have them in the warehouse? Great. What is my store number? Six. What? No. I'll call you back. Shut up. Six? Okay, we can start. You waited for me? Yeah. Pam, you're a member of this family, so we will wait for our family members. Phyllis, you want to give it a shot? I got it. When my mother was pregnant with me, they did an ultrasound and found she was having twins. When they did another ultrasound a few weeks later, they discovered that I had resorbed the other fetus. Do I regret this? No. I believe his tissues made me stronger. I now have the strength of a grown man and a little baby. Okay, why don't you throw the ball to somebody else? Nope. Oh, yes, Stanley, come on. Your turn. You have to go. I will not. Okay, I'm going to toss the ball to Pam. Let's see. I had an aunt that I was really close to. She was this amazing female boxer. Anyway, she was injured in a fight, and she was paralyzed. So you can imagine how upset I was when I found out that she asked her manager to remove her breathing tube so she could die. Wow. If you want to cry, that's okay. Thanks. A few years ago, my family was on a safari in Africa, and my cousin, Mufasa, was He was trampled to death by a pack of wildebeests, and we all took it really hard. All of us kind of in the audience of what happened. Do you want to talk about it any more? Oh, it would probably take me, like, an hour and a half to tell that whole story. Me, me. Me, me, me. Me, me. Yes. Okay. I was trying to throw this party once, and everyone was over for the weekend, and then my Uncle Bernie died. And so, me and my best friend, we had to pretend like he was alive, so Wait a second. That's Weekend at Bernie's. Do you think that this is a game? Well, there is a ball All right. We're starting over. No, I'm done. You are not leaving! No, we are not done! We really have a lot of work to do. Yeah, well, you know what? The guy who had my job has died and nobody cares! And he sat at my desk. Michael, look, I know this is hard for you, but death's just a part of life. I mean, just this morning I saw a little bird fly into the glass doors downstairs and die and I had to keep going How do you know? What? That that bird was dead? Did you check its breathing? It was obvious. Was its heart beating? Toby, did you check it? No, of course you didn't. You're not a veterinarian! You don't know anything! Michael! Michael? Michael. Oh, God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Come on. Poor little fella. Oh, shoot! He's a goner. No, he's not. Yeah. No, he's not. Michael, get him away from your head! He is covered in germs and bacteria! No! You can't get diseases from a bird! A dead bird should not be in the kitchen. We don't know if it's dead. No. That thing is dead. You want me to flush him? Attention, everybody. This will only take a second of your time. Today at 4:00 p. m. We will be meeting in the parking lot to have a funeral service for this bird. I have a lot of work to do. Well, I'm sorry to inconvenience you, Meredith, but that is what you do when things die. You honor them. Toby killed this bird and now we are going to honor it. But No! No! No! That's enough! You know what? This bird is dead. He died alone. The least you can do is be there for him now. Find a box for him. I'm calling a supermarket in Montreal. Nice. Nope. Sounded good. Thanks. It's okay. It's okay. Yes, I know, I know. It's been a tough day, but it's good to let it show. I mean, how many times do I have to confirm plans with Ryan for him to know that we have a date tonight? God! What are What are you doing? What? No, this is about the right size. No, God, no! It's not! What is the matter with you? Is that the beak? I'm sorry. I grew up on a farm. We slaughtered a pig whenever we wanted bacon. My grandfather was reburied in an old oil drum. It would have fit if he had given me another minute. I need a box, I need a box. A small box. Not too confining. Is it for the bird? Yeah. I have it covered. Oh, thank you. If you want to do something for the funeral. Yes, please. Maybe you could play a song on your recorder? Excellent. Do you have it with you? Always. Did I wake up this morning thinking I'd be throwing together a bird funeral? You never can tell what your day here is gonna turn into. Where'd you find them? Where'd I find what? I called the manufacturer, who referred me to the distributor, who referred me to the vending machine company, who told me that they sell them in the machines in the building next door. Glad you could all make it. You told us we had to. Dwight, do you have the box? Actually, I have it. You made this? Wow. That's That's very nice. When I was five, my mom told me that my fish went to the hospital in the toilet and it never came back, so we had a funeral for it. And I remember thinking, "I'm a little too old for this. " And I was five. I'd also like to say a few words if that's okay. Yes. What do we know about this bird? You might think, "Not much, it's just a bird. " But we do know some things. We know it was a local bird. Maybe it's that same bird that surprised Oscar that one morning with a special present from above. I remember that. That was so funny. And we know how he died, flying into the glass doors. But you know what? I don't think he was being stupid. I think he just really, really wanted to come inside our building to spread his cheer and lift our spirits with a song. It's not a songbird. An impression, then. Lastly, we can't help but notice that he was by himself when he died, but of course we all know that doesn't mean he was alone, because I am sure that there were lots of other birds out there who cared for him very much. He will not be forgotten. Amen. Just smile for me and let the day begin You are the sunshine that lights my heart within Society teaches us that having feelings and crying is bad and wrong. Well, that's baloney, because grief isn't wrong. There's such a thing as good grief. Just ask Charlie Brown. Let's get back to work. Guys, get a broom, let's clean this up. Grab a broom, you heard me. Mush!   Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas No! Why did you bring that here? Don't worry, she's dead. Oh, wait. He's dead. Dwight? What I accidentally ran over it. It's a Christmas miracle. Well, get it out of here. Relax, okay? And because this is Christmas, I am going to roast this goose and prepare it with a wild rice dressing. Do we have any cayenne pepper in the kitchen? Merry Christmas, Dwight. Jim. Wow. What do we got here? What does it look like? Dead goose. And circle gets the square. All right. So, can you watch this? I'm gonna get my carving knife out of the trunk. Oh, Dwight, we talked about this. No, Toby, this is different. He's already dead. Once I brought in a duck to prepare for lunch, and people got upset. Apparently they got attached to the duck and didn't want to see it killed. He was already dead, and we Schrutes use every part of the goose. The meat has a delicious, smoky, rich flavor. Plus, you can use the molten goose grease, and save it in the refrigerator, thus saving you a trip to the store for a can of expensive goose grease. Wow. Win-win. Exactly. Thank you, Jim. I like goose. And it's already dead. Is it so crazy if we eat it? That's crazy. It's crazy. Dwight, you cannot keep that here. Okay, that is ridiculous, and totally against the spirit of Christmas. Come on, Dwight, we went over this, like, for half an hour. It's Christmas, Toby. It's a dead animal in our office. You can't Toby I'm sorry. Please. Please. Clean it in your car. I would like it off my desk. Oh, Pam, take a chill pill. Deck the halls with boughs of holly Fa, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la 'Tis Hey! I would like a nice slice of Christmas Pam. Side of candied Pams. And perhaps, some Pam chops Can I help you, Michael? with mint. I'm looking for the Toy Drive box. It's behind you. Okay. Well, I need to put this bike in there. I hope it will fit, with all these little knick-knacks. Wow. What kind of bike is that? I don't know. Average kind. The tires look pretty worn. Well, that is probably from the test drive. But the paint's chipping. Is that your old bike, Michael? No. Yo, Michael. Sweet ride, Mike. Oh, thanks. Yes? Michael? Oh, Pam, that is so sweet. You didn't have to do that. I didn't. It's from corporate. Okay. Did everybody get one of these? Yep. Terrific. Good. This is going to be the best Christmas ever. My girlfriend, Carole, is coming to our party tonight and I have a little surprise for her. I've got two tickets to paradise Pack your bags We're leaving day after tomorrow I'm taking her to Sandals, Jamaica, all-inclusive. All-inclusive. You know what that means, right? Yeah! I think you're supposed to put a toy in the box, Creed. And a happy holiday to you. Carole. Hi. Is Michael around here? There she is! A Christmas Carole. Hello. You're about five hours early to the party. Oh, you're such a blonde. Michael Hey, everybody? I don't know who you haven't met yet, but I think this is one of them. This is my girlfriend, Carole. This is just the front of her. Show them the other side. What? Turn around. Turn around. Come on. Get out of here! No, you get out of here. Michael? Yes. If I may say, she's even prettier than you described her. Oh, ouch! Michael, I don't think there's anything wrong with the way you described her. Thank you. I really need a moment alone with you. Not as much as I need a moment alone with you. What is this? That is my Christmas card. It's a picture of you and me and your kids on a ski trip, having a blast. "Ski-eason's Greetings. " No. See, we never went on a ski trip. I know. I know. I went on a ski trip Right. two years ago with my kids and my ex-husband. Yes, but what you didn't realize at the time was that I was with you, in a sense. I was in your heart Michael  and next to your kids. What? This is so weird. I don't understand. It's a bold move to Photoshop yourself into a picture with your girlfriend and her kids on a ski trip with their real father. But then again, Michael's a bold guy. Is "bold" the right word? I think you're a really sweet guy. Okay. But I don't know how to deal with this thing, and the proposal, and I don't think things are gonna work out with us. No. No, no, no, no, no. Okay. Okay. You know what? You're not thinking straight. You know what you need? You need to think this through in "Jamaica's largest freshwater pool!" What are you talking about? I got us tickets to Sandals, Jamaica. We leave day after tomorrow. You had better find the skimpiest bikini there is. Michael And it's all-inclusive. Michael Yes. I'm sorry. No Carole? You walk out that door and it is over. I know. Jim? Hey. Hey. I need to give you your Christmas gift now, because Well, I'll just tell you. What? For the past few months, I've been sending Dwight letters from the CIA. Are you serious? They're considering him for a top-secret mission. There's his application. Oh, and this is where I made him list every secret he promised he'd never, ever tell. "Last year, my boss, Michael Scott, took a day off "because he said he had pneumonia, "but, really, he was leaving early to go to magic camp. " Wow. So, here's the gift. You get to decide what his top-secret mission is. Sorry I didn't wrap it. You know what? I really don't think I should be doing this stuff anymore, though. No, just because of the promotion. Oh, yeah. Just feels a little bit like No, I get it. Of course. Okay. I feel like there's a chance for me to start over. And if I fall back into the same kind of things I used to do, then what am I doing? I'd like everybody's attention. Christmas is canceled. You can't cancel a holiday. Keep it up, Stanley, and you'll lose New Year's. What does that mean? Jim, take New Year's away from Stanley. Michael, what's going on? Carole and I split up. Amicably. And I just don't think it would be appropriate to celebrate under the circumstances. Will they still air Rudolph? That's not fair! Are we going to cancel Hanukkah as well? Fine! Have your party. Just no guests. But we invited guests. Well, you know what, Phyllis? All of your guests would have probably canceled at the last minute anyway, leaving your life a stupid, rotten mess. So. Okay. It hurts. I know. It hurts my heart. It hurts my stomach. It hurts my arms. Okay, well, why are you laying like that? Thanks. How did you push away the bad thoughts? Like what? Like maybe, the real reason they left was because there were things they wanted you to do in bed that were What foreign and scary? I I don't really And not that you didn't want to try them. Some wine might have helped. Do you know what I'm referring to? I don't need to know. Michael? Yeah? Sorry to interrupt. It appears we're one bathrobe short. Take it from Toby. Copy. Pam, would you like to go to Sandals, Jamaica with me? It's all Okay. No, thank you. Hey, Dwight. Pretty nice robes. I Why? Phyllis, I need you to pick up green streamers at lunch. I thought you said green was whorish. No. Orange is whorish. So, I had a couple of ideas to make the Stamford people feel more at home. Each year we have a Christmas raffle Okay. It would never work here. Okay. Another idea was karaoke. No. A Christmas drinking game. Yes! God help you. What? These are all terrible ideas. And none of them are on the theme of a Nutcracker Christmas. I think you should leave. You're kidding. You tried this out, and it's clearly not for you. It's time to go. Come on. Please? Thank you. Okay. Thank you very much. You touched my heart you touched my soul You changed my life and all my goals I know you well I know your smell What are you doing? We're getting rid of everything that reminds you of Carole. Hey, what's the haps? Carole? Oh, look at this. Your old condo closing papers. It's riddled with Carole's name. I wish I could throw this in the box. You have been the one for me Why don't you just buy the whole song? I don't have to buy it. I just want to taste it. I just want I just want a little taste of it. Look at this, she saved you $2,000 because they failed to report a mold problem. But wouldn't that affect the final How did she Oh, I see what she did. That is good. Wow. That Carole is one smart cookie. Goodbye my lover, goodbye my friend You have been the one You have been the one for me You touched my heart, you touched my soul This is an old adage. But they say that when you find true love, you know within the first 24 hours. With Carole, I knew within the first 24 minutes of the second day I met her. I feel like I've been kind of cold to Karen. And there's no real reason for it. I mean, it's not like she's ever done anything to me. So, I think I probably shouldn't be cold to her. Hey, Karen, sorry about that meeting today. That was really crazy. Yeah, right? I'm so glad you said that. Because I don't know how those meetings usually go. Usually like that. Does anyone ever stand up to Angela? Or I think one of her cats did once. She came in with scratches all over her face. Right. I really liked your karaoke idea. Oh, cool, yeah. That could really be fun. You guys do a raffle? Thank you. Yeah, we do a raffle. Hey, Kev. Hey. This should have been up yesterday. It'll be all right. What is that? "The Committee to Plan Parties invites you "to a Margarita - Karaoke-Christmas"? There's no such thing as the Committee to Plan Parties! There is now. We just started it. Well, you can't just start a committee. You have to have funding. What's your funding? Two hundred dollars. What's ours again? Two hundred and one dollars. Right. Hey, a margarita-karaoke- Christmas party. That sounds like fun. No. That is not a party. There is only one party, and it's hosted by the Party Planning Committee, and it starts at 3:00. Then why are there two flyers? I understand that this is confusing for everyone. Let me explain. There's a party that starts at 3:00 Right. and then there's a way more fun party that starts at 2:45. Right, and if you're interested in the way-more-fun party, all the info can be found here, on our more brightly colored flyer. I didn't see where it was. Yep, looks like the Scranton people and the Stamford people are finally coming together. And that's what you want, right? I think that's really Pam and Karen, I am ordering you to cease and desist all party planning immediately. You can't do that. As ranking number three in this office, I am order I'm number three. You're number four. Yeah, but I'm number three. No. You must turn over to me all Christmas decorations and party paraphernalia immediately. They will be returned to you on January 4. Okay, I think I can help here. Okay, good. As ranking number two, I am starting a committee to determine the validity of the two committees, and I am the sole member. The committee will act on this now. Okay, this is stupid. Could you please keep it down? I'm in session. I have determined that this committee is valid. What? No! Yeah! No! Wait! Wait, wait, wait. Permission to join the Validity Committee. Permission denied. Damn it. Hey. I can't concentrate when I know you're in pain, man. Let me take you to lunch. Come on! My treat. All right. Nothing here to distract myself with anyway. That's my boy. I know the perfect place, too. Hooters? No. Benihana. Much classier. But don't worry, the babes are totally hot, too. I need my entourage. Jim! Dwight! Ryan. Come on. We're going to Asian Hooters. Oh, man, I can't. Why not? I'm not feeling so well. I got a ton of work to do here. MSG allergy, peanut allergy. I just ate there last night. All right. Feel better. Thanks. Come on, Jim, let's go. Okay. Wow! Thanks for taking all the excuses, dude. Doctor appointment. Car trouble. Planter warts. Granddad fought in World War II. Use your head, man. I keep mine in here. Look alive, Halpert. Welcome back. Bros before hos. Why? Because your bros are always there for you. They have got your back after your ho rips your heart out for no good reason. And you were nothing but great to your ho, and you told her that she was the only ho for you, and that she was better than all the other hos in the world. And then Then suddenly she's not your ho no mo'! So she looks really hot, so I said, "You look hotter than usual today. " Thank you. Michael? Head of the table. May I? Actually, sir, I'm going to need to take this chair, so Dwight, just leave him. Leave them alone, please. They are on a date. They look very happy. So she looks at me, right, and she goes, "I'm sorry. Do I even know you?" After a year! A year of buying lattes from her. Do you believe that? Yes. I can't hear what you're saying. Carole used to drink lattes. Who're you talking about? She would get this little foam mustache Carole had a mustache? and I used to say, "Hey, got latte?" And she'd say, "That's not funny. " What are you guys talking about? She totally got me. She understood that we didn't have to laugh Michael? to enjoy each other. Michael. What? Repeat what you said louder! It is my job to be there for Michael. How can I be there for Michael if I'm here for Michael? I'm already starting to forget what color eyes she had. I can't Okay, I'm gonna call her. I am going to call and find out No! Who are you calling? Put it away. Put that away. I'm going to call her. SOS! We Hi. Mayday! Man down over here. We need your help. What can I get for you? I think we'll start with a round of Nagasakis. One part eggnog, three parts sake. Some places won't make it for you, though, because eggnog is seasonal. You should put out salt for the rims. That's a great idea. Phyllis? I was just getting a snack. You can have your snack in here. Pam, don't tell her what to do. Phyllis? Okay. I think I'll go to Angela's party, because that's the party I know. I miss the days when there was only one party I didn't want to go to. So, I only use three? If you're using more than three pieces of tape to wrap a present, you're doing it wrong. Okay. And where'd you get all those cool bows? Oh, I just get those at any party supply place. Okay. Are you sure I can't use, like, the cartoons from the newspaper? Oh, yeah, your mom will love that. Hey. Hey. All right, I'll see you guys later. Bye. He's cute. You should date him. Yeah, maybe. Looks like you got a little Nakiri knife action going there. No, is Usuba. Yeah, I bet you wish you had a Nakiri, though. Actually, the Usuba is the better knife when you working with this quantity. I don't know. Still think Nakiri's better. I think he'd know. Nothing he's doing is cheering me up. Wait for the onion. Trust me. Hey, Cindy, he just had his heart broken. You wouldn't do that to him, would you? I don't know. Sure you would! Look at you. I bet you break up with a guy every hour. You made her laugh! Yes! She totally digs us. Watch. Watch. Watch. What did I tell you? You're right. That's good. Hello, everyone. We would just like to announce that our party is starting now in the break room. So I have a very important announcement to make about your paychecks. Your paychecks will be arriving, as scheduled, on Friday. And they will be in the correct amount that they normally are in. Please stand by for a very important announcement further regarding your paycheck! I need to know if I can start the party. Michael. Hey! Over here! Michael! It's I don't know. No one can hear me. You know what? Start the party. Did Michael give you permission to do this? Start the party. Also, I would like to inform you that, as a special treat, my party will be starting early. In fact, it will be starting right now. Our party is also starting now. Yeah. All right, Stanley! Good choice! Welcome, Hannah! You will not be disappointed! Why would I be disappointed? I said you wouldn't be disappointed. Meredith, if you don't come to my party, you will be very, very sorry. That a threat? No, it's an invitation. We have vodka! Lots of it. I hear Angela's party will have double-fudge brownies. It will also have Angela. So double-fudge, Angela. Double-fudge, Angela. Brownies. Cupcakes. Don't push it. Are we taking this too far? You know what, I don't think we're taking this far enough. What? I got goosebumps. I don't back down.

I like you. I really like you. So much, in fact, that I would like you to accompany me on a trip to Sandals, Jamaica. Nah, I have school. Can I help? Okay. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas. Lady, from the moment I saw you Standing all alone You gave all the love that I needed That waitress was the one. No, she wasn't. How can you be sure? Well, for starters, I've known you as a couple since the beginning of the relationship, which was approximately three hours ago Don't make fun of me. You're making fun of me. Sorry. I guess I didn't know her very well. I marked her arm. You what? I put a mark on her arm so I could tell them apart. I don't I know. I know. I can't believe I gave her my bike. Yeah. Why do I feel like crap? You just had a rebound. I had a rebound. Yeah. Which, don't get me wrong, can be a really fun distraction. But, when it's over, you're left thinking about the girl you really like, the one that broke your heart. I totally rebounded. Someone else shoots, and I take the ball and I score. Well, I guess I didn't really score, and I'm not sure who is actually shooting, but Whatever! Doesn't matter. It's all good. Or, as my ex might say, "Domo arigato, Mr. Scotto!" Little baby Pa rum pum pum pum I am a poor boy, too Pa rum pum pum pum I have no gift to bring Pa rum pum pum pum That's fit to give a king Pa rum pum pum pum Yeah. Yes, I just wanted to see if you would like to come to Jamaica with me. There's this resort called Sandals. Really? Okay. All right. I promise you won't be disappointed. It's all-inclusive. Shall I play for you? Pa rum pum pum pum Too soon. I played my drum for Him Pa rum pum pum pum I played my best for Him Pa rum pum pum pum Rum pum pum pum Rum pum pum pum Night, Pam. Night. Oh, you know what? Sorry, I forgot to tell you. I intercepted a transmission earlier, and it seems that the CIA is gonna need Dwight down in their headquarters at Langley for training and an ice cream social with the other agents. We should get him a bus ticket to make his trip easier. Oh, no, that would be great. We should try. It costs $75. Well, maybe the CIA could send a helicopter. "You have been compromised. Abort mission. Destroy phone. " "Destroy phone. "   Okay, where does it hurt? Just All over. I don't want to do anything. I'm dying. No, that's not how it works. You have to point to a specific part of the body. Right there. Abdomen. Menses. Maybe. "The uterus contracts after your egg passes through it. " Not it, I don't have eggs. So when did this start? About 10 minutes ago. I don't When I came in with the paperwork? About 40 times a year, Michael gets really sick but has no symptoms. Dwight is always gravely concerned. Is it possible you ate food that contained animal waste? It's possible. Michael? David Wallace is on line one. CFO? All right, everybody out. Out, out, out. Okay. To what do I owe this great honor, David Wallace? Michael, I am calling to see And Gromit. Jan? Is Jan there? Jan is out of town right now. Oh. You sigh like Jan. I broke Jan's heart, David. And I feel awful. It was It was never my intention to ruin a life. But you know what? Sometimes Michael? you just gots to get your freak on. Michael? Yeah? Michael? I am calling to see if you would come down and interview for a job we have opening up in corporate. Really? A week from today. Bring your first quarter stats and your recommendation for who'd take over the Scranton branch. Wow. I wish I had prepared something to say. That's not necessary. May God guide you in your quest. Yes. Okay. Everybody have their towels and swimsuits? We've got an hour and a half. I suggest that you all go potty now, and then we will be congregating on the party bus. Oh, I'm excited. Today is Beach Day. Michael is taking the whole office to the beach. So I'm wearing my bathing suit underneath my shirt. Oh, yeah. I packed it in my purse. Oscar, you brought your Speedo, I assume? I don't wear a Speedo, Michael. Well, you can't swim in leather pants. I'm just yanking your chain. Not literally. Anybody need sun block? I've got SPF 30. Oh. You know what? You're not going. It's Beach Day. Yeah, I know. I'm sorry. Toby, we Somebody has to stay here. I want today to be a beautiful memory that the staff and I share after I have passed on to New York. And if Toby's a part of it, then it'll suck. Hey. You want my sunscreen? Oh, great. I forgot mine and I'm wearing a two-piece. Thanks, Toby. Hey, Pam. I have a very important job for you today. I thought we were just having fun at the beach. We are. We are. But I would like you to take notes. And I want you to find out about people's character. You know, not their hotness, per se, but their humor and their charisma, and the indefinable quality that makes you all glad to follow me. What happens to a company if somebody takes a boss away? I will answer your question with a question. It's like what happens to a chicken when you take its head away. It dies. Unless you find a new head. I need to see which one of these people have the skills to be a chicken head. You want me to write down people's indefinable qualities? I want you to write down everything that people are doing all day and then type it up in a way that is helpful. All right? I have the most boring job in the office. So why wouldn't I have the most boring job on Beach Day? This way to the party bus. I just want to lie on the beach and eat hot dogs. That's all I've ever wanted. And the night got deathly quiet And his face lost all expression Said, "If you're gonna play the game, boy "You gotta learn to play it right "You got to know when to hold 'em "Know when to fold 'em" Yeah. "Know when to walk away Know when to run "You never count your money "When you're sitting at the table "There'll be time enough for counting "When the dealing's done" Everybody, may I have your attention, please? Today, we are not just spending a day at the beach. Oh, sweet mother of God. If you don't like it, Stanley, you can go to the back of the bus. Excuse me? Or the front of the bus or drive the bus. Just We are all participating in mandatory fun activities. Funtivities. And there is a special secret prize for the winner. Yes! Funtivities! I knew it wasn't just a trip to the beach. Okay, you know what? Your enthusiasm's turning people off. I hope there will be management parables. Well Hey, Pam. Did you get that down? Like what? Like everything I said and everything they did, and just I don't know exactly Don't Write it down before you forget it. That's You've just been drawing pictures. I can't stay mad at you. Here we are, ladies and gentlemen. Everybody ready? Last one down is a rotten egg. Watch out for snakes. Everybody, put on sunscreen. All right. Find a cozy spot. Everybody, settle in. Okay, everybody up. Circle around. Let us play some games. We are situated on the northeast corner of scenic Lake Scranton, America's eighth-largest indigenous body of water. It is here that a group of Americans will undergo the ultimate challenge. One day, fourteen strangers who work together, but only one survivor. What? Just words. Inspiring words. Not a contender. For the competitions, you will be divided into four tribes. Each tribe will have a leader that I will pick randomly off the top of my head without thinking. Jim, Dwight, Andy, and Stanley. Yes! Choose your tribes. Except for Pam, not Pam. Jim Halpert. Karen. Pros: Smart, cool, good-looking. Remind you of anybody you know? Cons: Not a hard worker. I can spend all day on a project, and he will finish the same project in half an hour. So that should tell you something. I choose Michael! I'm not playing. Okay. Temp. Dwight is an obvious candidate for my job. He has the best sales record in the office. He loves the work. He is, however, an idiot. We are going to choose team names. Dwight. We will be called Gryffindor. Really? Not Slytherin? Slytherin are the bad guys, Jim. I know. Okay, we will be Voldemort. He Who Must Not Be Named? I wouldn't do that. Voldemort. Voldemort. Okay, seriously Voldemort. Voldemort.  you really shouldn't be saying Voldemort. Voldemort. Idiots. Idiots. Okay, okay. Stanley, your team name? I don't care what you call my team. Then I will name your team the Red Team. No, the Blue Team. I am also considering Stanley because of all the good that black people have done for America. We will be Team USA. Very good. Pam, please, take a note that Andy is patriotic. Andy Bernard. Pros: He's classy, he gets me. He went to Cornell. I trust him. Cons: I don't really trust him. It is time for the great spoon and egg race. This one is with a little twist. There's already a twist, you're carrying an egg on a spoon. The person carrying the egg will be blindfolded. Please, put on your blindfolds. That person carrying the egg will go down, circle a torch, come back, deposit their egg in the pail. First team back is the winner. All right, ready, set, go! Come on, Phyllis, you can do it. Thank you so much. Phyllis is out. Yes! Follow my voice. Follow my voice. Yeah, keep it moving, keep it moving right this way. Looking good. I don't want to hit the big rock. Don't worry, you're not I know I'm near the big rock, I just know it. Nowhere near the big rock. Andy, I don't wanna get hurt by the big rock. What are you doing? No! See, now we're disqualified. I am okay if I lose every single contest today. Honestly. Because I see these contests as an opportunity for me to demonstrate what a good sport I am. Mallard. Stop, stop, stop. There's a hole. Move it! Just step over the hole. Move your ass! Yup. Come on, lazy-bones! Move it! Come on! Perfect. Just made it. Okay, turn left. Come on! Come on! Andale, Andale! Arriba! You have to stop this right now or I'm not gonna do this anymore. What are you saying? You have to stop yelling at me or I'm not gonna do the egg race. Okay, I apologize for yelling at you. That's what being a good captain is about. I'm trying to bring team spirit! It's about listening to your team. Whoa, stop. Another hole. Take a big step. I am not hysterical. I am explaining Yes! Oh, my God. You ass. There's nothing better than a beautiful day at the beach, filled with sun, surf and diligent note-taking. Pam, you're missing things! Let's go! Let's go! Come on! Mush! Mush! Come on, you bastard! What the Damn it, temp! Great job, everyone, that was fantastic. Okay, Pam, I have another little project for you. Does it have to do with these shopping bags filled with hot dogs? Smart as a whip! Yes. These are pre-cooked, so it's not absolutely necessary, but I would appreciate it if you could heat up 800 hot dogs for a little contest I'm going to be having. I would greatly appreciate it. When's the contest? Like, 10 minutes? How am I supposed to get Thanks a bunch. A good manager has got to be hungry. Hungry for success. Okay, who's hungry? No, no, no, do not touch the food. Please, not yet. That is our next event. A hot dog-eating contest. Oh, God. For those of you who are curious, the world record is 54 and one half hot dogs. Wow. And you know what? I personally have cooked up enough so that each and every one of you could break that record. So shoot for the stars, okay? All right! The team that eats the most hot dogs in 10 minutes will be declared the winner! On your mark, get set Can I have a turkey burger? No. I have the only one. I claimed it. Ready? Turkey is a healthy meat. Yeah, it's very good for you. I don't eat meat, Michael. I'm not gonna eat this. It has L-tryptophan. Guys, guys. Come on What's L-tryptophan? Please! Let's just Okay, it's very important that you all try to eat as many hot dogs as you can. On your mark, get set, eat! Is there any mustard? No mustard! No mustard! Just eat it! Eat it, Phyllis. Dip it in the water so it'll slide down your gullet more easily. Come on, the winner gets a big, big prize. What is it? I can't say. You can't say? Or you can't pronounce it? The winner gets regional manager salary for a year and a Sebring and the feeling that they're making a difference in the world. Can we just take those first two things? The winner of today gets my job. Okay? I'm interviewing for a job at corporate. And they're only interviewing a handful of people, and I'm the most qualified, and I'll probably get it, all right? You're leaving? I didn't wanna tell anybody. I didn't wanna cast a pall over our fun Beach Day. But you know what? I don't know who to recommend, because, frankly, nobody's stepping up. I am so hungry. Do you expect me to believe that you're truly making your recommendations on this basis? Word. Here we go. Let's see it. I would rather work for an upturned broom with a bucket for a head than work for somebody else in this office besides myself. Game on. Come on. Come on. Four seconds. Three, two, one Stop your eating! And the winner is Andy Bernard Team USA! with 14 hot dogs! One came up. Thirteen hot dogs, everybody. Damn it! Nobody told me we were gonna have hot dogs. Sabotage. What? What are you saying? Did you say sandwich? No. I was saying that before. Not now. Now I am saying sabotage. The ancient Dutch art of screwing up your own team. I knew you were saying sabotage. I was giving you an example of it. I will misunderstand everything that Andy says until he goes insane. If Michael organizes some kind of group hug, stand next to me. It's very simple. There are only three rules. You must not touch the ground. You must not step outside of the ring. And you must always wear the safety mittens. We don't have any safety mittens. Probably left them in the trunk of my car. It's all right. Here we go. Get him, big boy! And go! Come on, Jim! Come on! What are you doing? Come on! Stop. Nice, Stanley! Sorry about that. It's all about taking points away from Dwight. Yeah. No. Good. Okay. Oh, my God. I have never seen that look in a man's eyes, ever. I thought that I might die. On Beach Day. Come on! Come on! Come on! If either of these guys are put in charge of the office, I will transfer to Albany. Gil can come if he wants. I'm kind of looking for a way out of that relationship, anyway. I think I might try girls for a while. Angela thinks I can cross over. We'll see. One, two, three! Yeah! Yeah! Excellent! Gryffindor! Gryffindor! Come on! I didn't win. But the only reason I didn't win is because I recently learned that it's better to work things out with words. That's not why you lost. Yeah, it is. I totally could have kicked your butt. Oh, yeah, right. Yeah, right. Yeah, right! Come on, come on! God! How do you like that? Help. Help! Angela! Angela, hey. Oh, thank God. Go tell somebody. What, Andy? Andy, what should I tell them? Go tell them I'm floating away, obviously. I don't understand what you want from me. Angela, it's pretty simple. Look at what I'm doing and go tell somebody it! Sorry! Bye, Andy! Angela! I knew that finding a successor would be difficult. I did not know that it would be impossible. Thus far the candidates have been wildly disappointing. Jim is not taking it seriously. Stanley is having a stroke. And Andy, where is he? Where the hell is Andy? Where is he, Pam? Do you know? Who's ahead in points? I think they're even. At various times you gave Jim 10 points, Dwight a gold star, and Stanley a thumbs-up. And I don't really know how to compare those units. Well, check to see if there is a conversion chart in that notebook. I really doubt it, Michael. Please, just check. Great. Yeah, I'll see you next week. Thank you. And here is Karen Filippelli. Bye. Hello? Yeah, hi, David. Yes, I would like to be considered for the corporate position in well. "In well"? As well. How would that work, in well? I just want to know. Yes. Wait a minute. That would be fine. If this job is in a well, I don't want it. I don't. What does a great manager need most of all? Courage. How so? I mean, sure thing. That sounds smart. I can't do this anymore. I'm going to sit in the bus. Your loss, Stanley. Meanwhile, the rest of us will have a super-fun time defeating our fear and creating a lasting memory walking through fire! Who among you has the guts to replace me? Let him walk across these coals. Are you gonna try it? I'm not gonna walk in the fire after your disgusting feet have gone through. Angela, it is a million degrees. I'm gonna do it. And I fully expect to burn my feet and go to the hospital. That's the right spirit when doing a coal walk, right? No, no. Not you, Pam. You have to keep score. I'd like to try it. Pointless. But I'm not kidding, I really wanna do it. Okay? This is about guts. It takes guts to be a regional manager. Jim, you're up. Nope. Why not? Come on. Oh, 'cause I don't want my feet to get burned. You do not have what it takes to be a regional manager. That's harsh. Who's next? Andy, where is Andy? Andy is never here today. Hello? Who's there? My name is Andrew Bernard, I was with a group called Dunder Mifflin. Hello? Why don't you go, Michael? Because I already did. Remember? I burned my foot on the George Foreman Grill. That is not the same at all. If you're gonna ask other people to do it, you should do it yourself. All right, okay. All right. Fine. Okay. Okay. Go. The mind has to wrap around the foot. Okay. You want us to count to three? Yes, count to three, please. Three, two, one! Three, two, one! Count the other way. Go. No, no. Count one, two, three. Okay, okay. Not three, two, one. One, two, three. One, two, three. Go! Do it! Go, Michael. Wait. Am I going on "go" or am I going on "three"? On "three". On the "go" that's after "three". Okay. One, two, three, go! One, two, three, go! No! It's okay. I will do this, Michael. Don't, Dwight I will walk and stand on these coals until you award me the position of regional manager! Wow. Yes. Dwight. Dwight. Dwight. Keep moving if you're gonna walk there. Keep moving! Keep coming. Give me the job! That's enough! Give me the job! I'm not going to give it to you! Don't kneel on the coals! Oh, my God! Michael, do something! God, that stinks! Dwight, stop it! Being a boss is also about image. I've never looked like that. That was gross. I just I don't see the connection between a fire walk and management. Worst $75 I ever spent. You know what? If I had to pick my replacement based on today, it would be Mr. Outside Hire. Or Mrs. Outside Hire. Yeah. True. Look, I don't I don't wanna leave this branch that I love to an outside hire. Therefore, we're going to have a 100-point, winner-take-all, sudden death, Tribal Council round to test the aspect of my job that I think is the most important, something I call the Bob Hope factor. Who's Bob Hope? God. He's He's a comedian. Oh, like Amanda Bynes. Who's Amanda Bynes? She's from What a Girl Wants. Oh, I love that movie. Yes. Kelly is right. The person to replace me has to have a great sense of humor. And they have to possess the leadership qualities of a Bynes or a Hope. So, without further ado, Jim and Dwight. Show us what you've got. Hey. I know what you're looking for, but I gotta be honest, I really don't think I should be considered as your replacement. You are being too modest. Michael, on Thursday, I'm gonna drive down and interview with David for the open position in New York. Okay, that is not funny. I am deducting 60 points from Voldemort for false pretenses. Okay, Dwight, your turn. Wow us. The Aristocrats. A man and his wife and children go into the offices of a talent agency. And the talent agent says, "Describe your act. " And the man says something really, really raunchy. And the talent representative says, "What do you call yourselves?" And the man says, "The Aristocrats. " I mean, truly repulsive acts. That is a very, very funny story. Hey. I wanna say something. I've been trying to be more honest lately, and I just need to say a few things. I did the coal walk. Just I did it. Michael, you couldn't even do that. Maybe I should be your boss. Wow, I feel really good right now. Why didn't any of you come to my art show? I invited all of you. That really sucked. It's like sometimes some of you act like I don't even exist. Jim, I called off my wedding because of you. And now we're not even friends. And things are just, like, weird between us, and that sucks. And I miss you. You were my best friend before you went to Stamford. And I really miss you. I shouldn't have been with Roy. And there were a lot of reasons to call off my wedding. But the truth is, I didn't care about any of those reasons until I met you. And now you're with someone else. And that's fine. It's Whatever. That's not what I'm I'm not Okay, my feet really hurt. The thing that I'm just trying to say to you, Jim, and to everyone else in the circle, I guess, is that I miss having fun with you. Just you, not everyone in the circle. Okay, I am gonna go walk in the water now. Yeah. It's a good day. Pam! That was amazing! But I am still looking for someone with a sales background. Flintstones. Meet the Flintstones They're a modern stone age family From the town of Bedrock They're a page right out of history Let's ride with the family down the street Through the courtesy of Fred's two feet When you're with the Flintstones You'll have a yabba dabba doo time A dabba doo time You'll have a gay, old time! Wilma! Nice. And the same thing goes for quarterly reports. They're unreadable. They're just numbers, and boring, and black. So what I was thinking is that maybe we should have some sort of graphic. Like if we have a bad quarter, put in a storm cloud. And, when we have a good quarter fireworks. Or a race car. Doesn't have to be a race car. Use your imagination. There's this cube on the screen, and it bounces around all day. And sometimes it looks like it's heading right into the corner of the screen and at the last minute it hits the wall and bounces away. We are all just dying to see it go right into the corner. Pam claims that she saw it one day when she was alone in the conference room. Okay I believe she thinks she saw it. I saw it. I saw it, and it was amazing. Who said I didn't see it? Did Jim say that? I saw it! We have a lot of colored paper here. Why, oh, why, do we keep printing this on white? No! Come on! Yeah. I know. I know. It's bland. - It's never gonna happen. - Dude, you've gotta believe. Maybe we could have some sort of riddle - Wait for it. - Like something that you have to look for Sort of a Where's Waldo? All r- All right. Let's quit while we're ahead. - That was so awesome. - That was awesome. Thank you. Some days, I am just on fire. What can I say? Episode 4x03 "LAUNCH PARTY" Hey, there he is. Hey, Meredith. How you feeling? I never thanked you for coming. Oh, please, it was my pleasure. Well, we all came, so Well, I real appreciate you coming. I'm singling you out. Anyway, I have this sharpie. And I was wondering if you could sign my cast. - Can you write where I can read it? - Yep. I'll read this when I get home. All right. Michael, this is the press release I told you about. Ryan wants you to share it. Oh, does he? He does. Okay. Attention, earthlings. I have some news. Today's the big day that I'm heading to New York to attend a party with sushi and important people. On an unrelated note, if anybody has an interesting anecdote that is not boring and easy to memorize please drop by my office before I leave. Thank you. Was that really what Ryan wanted you to tell us? And "Today the Dunder Mifflin Infinity website officially launches. " Well, the website is the brainchild of my brainchild, Ryan. It is my brain grandchild. And, to celebrate its birth, all of the different branches are going to have satellite parties which will be connected via web cams and fibers to the real party, which is going on in New York City at a very exclusive nightclub. And that is where all of the VIPs, including yours truly, will be partying with new york city's finest. And I do not mean policemen. "The company is projecting record high sales "and that by 6:00, the website will be the new best salesman in the company. " Watch out, Dwight. That's ridiculous. I'm not gonna be beaten by a website. - Actually, it sounds like you are. - Really? 'Cause Ryan says so? That's from Ryan? Does it mention if he's seeing anybody? No. I'll find out tonight. Yes, please let us know. I can make more sales than a computer. In fact, I challenge that website to make more sales than me today. - Waste of time. - What's tha pipsqueak? Waste of time. The website's going to win. - You believe a computer can beat me? - I don't care, but yes. - I'll prove you wrong. - I don't care, and you won't. - You'll see. - I won't be watching, and I won't. Dwight mercy killed Angela's cat. It's very complicated. It's caused a lot of unpleasantness between Dwight and Angela. Who were both already prone to unpleasantness. Stanley, you're dancing. No, I'm not. Yeah, I created a website. Look. At the end of the day, Apple's apple is flying at 30,000 feet. This is a paper company. And I don't want us to get lost in the weeds or into a beauty contest. I told you I don't want you doing these things. You can use your own office or do it in the hall. Convergence, viral marketing. We're going guerilla. We take it to the streets while keeping an eye on the stree, Wall Street. I don't want to reinvent the wheel here. In other words, it is what it is. Buying paper just became fun. And this is where I will record your sales. Very nice. And then will say something positive like "kudos" or "job well done. " Or zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah. - I can't tell if he's mocking me. - Just ignore him. Can't do that. It's really hard for me to let things go. I was. Mocking. Thank you. I just feel like we need something more to acknowledge when I make a sale. - Yes, like a chime or a bell. - Or a gong. Go to my car. Open the trunk. Inside, you will see many pelts. Under the smallest one is a case. Inside that case is a bear horn. Bring it to me. Yes! Isn't 7:00 P.M. a little late for a lunch party? Lunch party? It's supposed to say launch party. What is wrong with you? Angela is worse than usual lately, and we have a party to throw. So I googled "how to deal with difficult people," and I got all of this. So we're gonna try out some new things today. How do you feel about the fact that the banner says "lunch"? I feel angry. Angry at you. Angry at you for doing something stupid. Angry at me for believing you could do something not stupid. I'm so sorry to hear that. That must be awful. It is awful. You've made this day awful. Maybe you could just change the "u" into an "a". Then it would say "lanch" party, Kevin. Would it be better if it said "lanch" party? - Lunch party. - It's supposed to say "launch. " Easy, booster seat. Nobody cares about this party anyway. I care! Plan a party, Angela. Oh, and the entire world will see it. Oh! And here's $65 for your budget. And here are 4 idiots who'll do nothing but weigh you down. Oh, and your cat's still dead. - 20 seconds to go time. - Got it. Carb up. Really? Power gel? Hey, you wanna win, you gotta fuel like a winner. Okay. We start as soon as I make this shot. What would you say if I told you we could pull a prank on Dwight and at the same time not be working? What? - He goes through a breakup. - I'm aware of that. But he's also being super-annoying, and I'm not a perfect person. - You got one! - Three reams! In your face, machines! What kinda prank are you thinking? What if I told you I could offer free shipping? Sure, I'll hold. Who am I? You tell me. Not sure. Just became self-aware. So much to figure out. I think I'm programmed to be your enemy. I think it is my job to destroy you when it comes to selling paper. How do I know this isn't Jim? What is a Jim? It appears that the website has become alive. This happens to computers and robots sometimes. Am I scared of a stupid computer? Please! The computer should be scared of me. I have been salesman of the month for 13 out of the last 12 months. You heard me right. I did so well last february that corporate gave me two plaques in lieu of a pay raise. Yes, it's too tight. Way too tight. - Really? - This is why I'm here? Why is it so tight? It's a european cut. It just looks bad. What's hanging? - Setting up the web cam for the party. - Oh, good. Okay, cool. How many pounds I could lose by 7:00? Depends how much you've eaten already today. I had Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam. Just one second, we're in a meeting. I'll see if he's available. It's Jan. Why don't you wanna go tonight? What- All your friends will be there. My friends? Michael, I was terminated. Just. - Is it that important to you? - Yeah! - All right. - Thank you. Go by yourself. No- No. No. If I go by myself, everybody'll think I'm a big loser. - Well - I've your permission to invite Carol? - What? Jesus, Michael! - I'm sor- I'm sorry. It's just the first girl that popped into my head. I'll find somebody I haven't slept with. Nice! Website check, please. You, my friend, are winning handsomely. Oh, it just made another sale- You, my friend, are in a very close second. - 402. - Okay, why don't you just lay off? What you want me to do, not announce it? So, this is the dealio. God has smiled upon me and given me two tickets to the big party in New York tonight. What are you doing this evening? Look at that. They have their own little language now, like twins. - Sure, we'll go. - All right. Fight it out amongst yourselves. I was thinking Pammy, but boys' night out is also good. Oh, I'm sorry. What? - One of the tickets is for him. - Just let me know who the winner is. - Not it. I won. - Not it. Nope. Definitely not. If anything, it was a tie. Tie goes to the girlfriend. No, I realize you normally reorder in november, but what I'm suggesting- You did what? Oh! No! That's exactly what you're not supposed to do, damn it! Why reorder from a computer when you could have the personal touch of a salesman? - How's it going? - Fine. Good. - Yeah? - Yeah. - You look a little worried. - I do not look worried. You do look worried. "Here's a suggestion, computer. "I assume you read binary. "So why don't you 011-11-011-011?" Um, while you were typing that, I searched every database in existence and learned every fact about everything And mastered the violin. Oh, and sold more paper. I asked for assort cutlery, and I got back spoons. These are worthless. I want to understand what you're saying, but it's difficult for me when you use that tone. Phyllis, these are spoons. Spoons have round tops and are used to scoop things. What we need are forks which have prongs or tiny spears on top. And we need knives which have blades. Do you understand me now? Yes. Goody. - Hey. - What's up? - What's going on? - Paper delivery. - Oh, yeah? - Kelly ordered this online. What are you doing? I'm in the fight of my life against this computer, and every sale counts. But when you put paper in the shopping cart, it says, "Thanks for shopping with Dunder Mifflin. " Damn it, Kelly, it knows! It knows what you did! - Who knows? - Return it. Return it now. Hey How about instead of yelling at our sweet Miss Kapoor over 500 sheets of paper, you get back to your desk and start selling multiple reams, like a man. You don't understand. Okay, if this makes the difference, I'm gonna tell it that you were responsible. Who's "it"? - Here you go. - Thanks. You still missing Ryan? Not so much anymore. I am not a bad person. When I left Staples, I took some of their leads with me, but I never intended to use them. What did intend to do with them? Who knows? Maybe keep them as a souvenir. Maybe use them. Yes, Mr. Galliatto, how would you like to pay 10% less for paper than you're paying right now? It's not important how I got your information. What is important is that you say yes. - Good. - All right. I'm ready to go, and I'm calling shotgun. - I'm driving? - Yes, thank you. Let me just say good-bye to Pam. Oh, yeah, you better. You better say good-bye to Pam. Say good-bye to Pam. Good-Bye. I love you. I love you- Okay. I'm leaving inside Jim's car I don't know when I'll be back again Yes, I do Tomorrow I'll be back I'll be back tomorrow So you know what? Why don't you guys take off a little bit early tonight? Because there's a party. A party for the web site I've been planning for two weeks. If you are not this tall, you may not ride the roller coaster. - See you tomorrow. - Perfect. So let me just get some basic information from you. Oh. I didn't realize we could use the leads we stole from Staples. I'm sorry, so sorry. Yes, could you repeat that? Yes! Ten reams for the U.S. district court! Did I mention the 40 reams for the battered women's shelter? No! Stop it! Give me that! Give it! - Did you see the board? - There's still an hour. You ever read this? Yep. A long time ago, but I liked it. I got it for Ryan. I wanted to get him "Oh, the places you'll go," but they were sold out. It's the same sort of stuff in here. It's not, but it's a good book. What was that? Leaving Pennsylvania. Two kisses. - One for me, one for Jan. - Gotcha. You should come for dinner. You and Pam, that'd be fun. - That would be fun. - Wanna come over friday? - I can't. - After work, you guys- Oh, no, because- Let me know when we're close. Yes. Actually, I will tell you right now. It's a club called chat room, and there's a password to get in. Which is actually "password," so Okay. What are you doing? That is an invitation to an online party. No. I'm sure that's not- Are there three "Ws" at the beginning of the address? - Yes. - Yep. Well, the invitation says "VIPs only. " Is this how you treat your VIPs, Ryan? We're already in the city. The main part with the buildings. What am I supposed to do? What do you want me to do tonight? And if you tell me that I have to drive back to Scranton to the satellite party, I am going to throw up. Okay, I'm going to throw up. I'm throwing up. You're making me throw up, Ryan. You know that is is like? I will tell you. This is like when the freshmen would throw a party, and wouldn't let any of the seniors go. Doesn't it piss you off sometimes that little twerp got the promotion over us? Oh, actually I withdrew from consideration. Yeah, I withdrew too. Four, three, two, one! Yes! After numerous projections that the computer would crush all salesmen in its path, I am very happy to report that our very own Dwight Schrute has crushed his electronic nemesis, if you will, by a whopping 52 - reams! - Reams! Say it again- Announcing it. - 52 reams! - No, no, the first part. Dwight has defeated the computer! Hey. So What do you think? I did it for you. I didn't ask you to do it for me. You didn't have to. How do you tell someone it's over? You send them a notarized letter, right? Well, what if the recipient is your notary? - Hello, Pam. - Hello. Hey, do you have any men that you can fix me up with? I would like to have a relationship with a man. I'll get back to you. Let me know. You beat me. You are the superior being. All right, who wants to party? - Why aren't you in New York? - Oh-ho, what?! Oh, I think I faked Oscar out. You said you weren't coming back and we could leave early. I think I faked Stanley out too. Who else thought that I was leaving, and that he could go home early? Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha. Well, who needs New York? Right? We can have a killer party right here in Scranton. Thank you. No, no. It's gonna be nothing like the party you've been planning. This is going to be good. And everybody's gonna come. What's wrong with Dwight? - He beat the computer. - Oh, hey, good for you. Good for you. Scranton power! You know what? Angela, I'd like you to come into my office in ten minutes. Bring something to write with, and to write on. Good. It was a pretty disappointing day. It was kind of a slap in the face. To realize that I wasn't as important as I thought I was to a certain young executive Who I'd cared about. But you know, I'm not gonna cry over it. I did that in the car on the way home. - How we doing on time? - The party starts in an hour. Good, these are some things that I would like to have happen. "Beer, light beer, streamers, orchids, better lighting, something made of ice. " It's just things. This is how I want it to feel. "Pizza with mushrooms, pizza without mushrooms, white pi- " I would like this party to be sexier, cooler, more important- "Chocolates, someone famous, cool music, confetti, go-go dancers"? I want it to embarrass all other parties. I want it to be a party that the guys in New York watch on the web cam and say, "How did they get Al Roker to come?" - I can't do this. - Yes, you can. Yes, you can. I know you can. I wouldn't say that if I didn't 100% believe it. Who else could do this? - Okay. Okay. - No, seriously. Anyone else could do it better? Because we don't have a lot of time. I'll get the pizza. What do you think of Angela? I think she's efficient. No, not like that. As a woman. W- O-M-A-N I hadn't noticed. You hadn't noticed she's a woman? I hear she's single and ready to mingle. I'm thinking about making a play for her. What do you think? Crazy, right? I think it's inappropriate to date someone you work with. - Isn't that part of the fun? - No. I think you should date Kelly. She works here too. How is that any different? She works in the annex. You're also welcome to date Toby. Okay. - Good news. - We get to go home? Guess who just ordered from your favorite pizza place, Alfredo? Wait Alfredo's pizza cafe Or pizza by Alfredo? - Same thing. - No. I don't understand when you all talk at the same time! Oscar, talk to him. Michael, there's a very big difference between these two pizza places. Both in quality of ingredients and in overall taste. Which one did you order from? Pizza by Alfredo. All right, you know what? Okay, okay. What is better, a medium amount of good pizza, or all you can eat of pretty good pizza? A medium amount of good pizza. Oh, no, it's bad. It's real bad. It's like eating a hot circle of garbage. You can pick one of these things. It's unreasonable for you to ask me to do all of this. It should take you no time if you put the care into it that you normally do. That seemed to shut her up. You looking for dinner and a movie? You're not gonna find it in that box. It just so happens I know where you can find it, but again Not in the box. Angela, are you hearing words that I'm saying? What? Hello. I worked on a party for 3 weeks that just got thrown out the window. So now I've to organize a whole new party. And my useless number two quit, so now there's no one in charge of orchids, chocolates, or the ice made thing. And my upper back itched all day, and I can't reach it. And Kevin had greek food for lunch again. They say you should never mix business with pleasure. Really? Well then explain to me how a putt-putt golf company operates. - Yep. - The Pizza by Alfredo guy is here. - You don't have to say it like that. - I said it normal. - Hey. - Hey. Uh, $63.50, and that's not including tip. Right, I've a coupon, so half of $63.50, and half the tip on $63.50 Half-off coupons only apply to orders of two pizzas. No, I told them on phone I was ordering eight pizzas. I don't care what you told them on the phone. That's our policy. You didn't think that I was gonna spend 60 bucks on pizza? It's not pizza. It doesn't say it anywhere on the coupon, and if it's your policy, it should say it on the coupon. What do you mean? - Not my problem. - It is your problem. That's no way to do business, okay? I ordered eight pizzas with a half-off coupon, so I would like eight pizzas for half off, end of story. Great story. - $63.50, and that's not including tip. - I'm not giving that to you. Then, you're not getting your pizzas. No, no, you're not- You are not going anywhere. You're going to stay here until we figure this out. - What? - You know what? This young man needs to learn that that's not how you treat people. I don't care if it's pizza. Good business is about respect and accountability and follow-through. You don't just make promises and pull the rug out from under somebody, do you? Dwight, please escort this young man into the conference room. Right now. - I'm not going in there. - Yeah, you are. And you'll come out when you decide to give me a discount. Please. Thank you. This is stupid. No, you don't even know what stupid is! It's about to get all stupid up in here! You find anything? We think it's a straight forward kidnapping. Stanley, could you look up "accomplices?" Why can't you guys do it? Because we're looking up "jail time. " Fine. I've seen this kid, he sneaks onto my farm and steals my hemp. Yeah, I know that guy. He's that farmer that grows really crappy weed. - You ready to give me my discount now? - No. What have you done in here this whole time? - What kind of business is this? - A paper company. The best paper company in the whole wide world! Dwight, knock it off. You'd better think about what you're doing. Think about what you're doing. No. I'm an adult. I don't have to think or do anything. You're a kid. You're a little snot-nose punk kid who thinks he's better than everybody else. Because he's some hotshot. And you don't know anything about sales. So stop being a disrespectful little jerk, okay? - Sales? - Yeah, sales. You sell pizza. - That's called sales. - You're such a loser. - What did you call him? - A loser. - What did you say?! - A loser. Okay, stop it. Stop it! Stop getting him to say it! - You just made this worse. A lot worse. - I can make him talk. We are accomplices. Stop talking all at once! - You need to let him go. - Let go of little jerk boy? Before he has learned his lesson? - Yes. - You know what, Jim? World would be a better place if people were held accountable for their actions. Yes, but not by kidnapping them. I'm not kidnapping him. I'm keeping him until I get what I want. As a hostage. - You over-think it. - You under-think it. Yes, is Alfredo there? May I speak to manager then? Okay, could you tell the manager that I am keeping his delivery kid until I get my discount on the eight pizzas I ordered? Yes, I know it is not on the coupon. Also, I would like him to throw in two- three pizzas just for our - Ransom. - trouble. Okay. All right. - What'd he say? - He said no. - So we should let him go. - No, no. Listen up, kid. I don't like you, but because some town in Switzerland says so, you have rights. I have to hang these. Why are you looking at her like that? Hey! What's going on? Michael called the pizza place with demands. Mr. Overdramatic. What's up, Kev? We're getting hungry out there. We're all accomplices now anyway, so we figured we might as well eat. We would like to order some good pizza from Alfredo's pizza cafe while we wait for the hostage situation with the bad pizza to end. I needed another hour. It could have been done in another hour. I think it looks good. That's why you're not in charge, Meredith. Here you are, my dear. One thing made of ice. How did you Where- Where did you It's just ice. It'll melt all over the floor. - Will you help me put it over there? - Yes, I will. Excuse me. I stole it. Thank god. Ryan wants to introduce the branch managers in a few minutes. You just have to wave and introduce yourself. I'll just wave and introduce myself. - Quick question. - Yeah. If I take a pizza, do you think you could take some sodas and some napkins up to the roof? - I'm all over it. - Okay. What do we got here? - Good pizza. - Yeah? - Cheese, or do we have other flavors? - Different stuff. Which one's this? Perfect. Do you remember what you said to me on my first day at work, just before you walked me over to my desk? "Enjoy this moment, because you're never going to go back to this time "before you met your desk-mate Dwight. " And that's when I knew. You? You came up to my desk and you said, "This might sound weird, "and there's no reason for me to know this, "but that mixed berry yogurt you're about to eat has expired. " That was the moment that you knew you liked me? Yep. - Can we make it a different moment? - Nope. Can I start talking? Is this thing on? Give me a signal when you want me to start. And now, from my old hometown, Scranton, Pennsylvania, my former boss, Michael Scott. I just think you should know that one of my salesmen beat your stupid computer. So take that, asshole. Always a jokester. How about that image? Crystal clear. If anyone out there is listening, I'm being held here against my will. I'm a minor. What are you doing? You said your upper back itched. - I didn't ask you to scratch it. - Angela, I know this is weird because we work together, and because up until and possibly including now, I've repulsed you. - But I like you. - I'm not dating you. So Angela is stubborn as a mule. She's giving off fairly strong vibes that she's not interested. But do I like her or not? Because if I like her, then I can't back down. If you're going number one, you've got ten more seconds! Hey, have you seen Jim? I guess he wanted get out of here before the cops find out. What are you doing? Scaring him. The trick is to make him think you're gonna do something to him. - I can hear you, man. - Shut up! Or I punch you in the throat! Stop it! Stop it! No. God. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. I kidnapped a kid. You had to. What other choice did you have? I've gotta pay for the pizza. Well Yeah. Oh, my god. - This is Michael. - Hello, Michael, this is Ryan. - First off, thanks for the shout-out. - You're breaking up. I can't hear you. Why's there a kid on your web cam saying that he's being held against his I want you to go in there and pay him for the pizzas, and give him a generous tip. No more than 10%. - What will you do? - I will open the door. - Yeah? - And hopefully, he will walk out. And the rest is out of our hands. So I'm paying full price? Yes. Here we go. $65. You know what? Here's two more. See ya. Drive safely. Okay. Now what? Now we wait and hope that nothing happens. All right. I assume I'm going to be reimbursed? Not now, Dwight, please. Not the time. A toast. Better make it good. To avoiding a class 2 felony charge. Hello? Hey. Hang on a second. Hello? Hang on. If you change your mind I'll be first in line Honey, I'm still free Take a chance on me If you need me let me know Gonna be around If you got no place to go If you're feeling down If you're all alone When the pretty birds have flown Honey, I'm still free Take a chance on me Gonna do my very best And that ain't no lie If you put me to the test If you let me try Take a chance on me That's all I ask of you, Angela. - Hey, how'd it go? - Yeah, what'd she say? I don't know yet. I've to call you back. - You gotta give us- - I'll call you back! I have to go clean up after the party. What a horrible day. Well, I need to get the horrible taste of this pizza out of my mouth. I'd really like some sushi. I was hoping that I would have New York-style sushi today. And you know what? - What? - I'm gonna get it. Cooper says calamari. There's only one place to get New York-style sushi. - Tokyo? - New York. You wanna go? - Yes! - All right, you drive. Okay! - Nice! - Here we go. I'm sorry- You guys are gonna have to leave. Hey, you know what? Come on. Come on. Let's go! Hey, you're the Scranton guy. - Guilty. - I liked your statement tonight. Okay. Thanks. This is the guy that beat the computer. Oh, very cool. It was funny to see Ryan all embarrassed by that. Yeah. See you later. Later on. I'm Ryan, and tonight didn't go the way that I thought it would. Because it didn't work out for me. I'm very embarrassed. I have egg all over my face. And I'm 12 years old. I spent so much time in Scranton, but I never sold any paper. I never sold any paper, because I'm an idiot. I started a fire with my cheese peeler. And dated an indian girl. I started a fire. Now I got a beard. And I have new shoes and I'm your boss. I'm hot. I'm so hot. - That- That's why everybody- - I don't get- I don't understand that. That's part of it. It's just Wanna head back? Yeah, let's go. Hello, this is Dwight Schrute. - Hello? - Hello, this is Dwight. Hello? Hello? Yes, we do have that. Hold on one second. - Jim what are you doing? - And how many would you like? - Hang that up right now. - I can get that out to you immediately. It's an imposter. Don't do business with him, this is not Dwight Schrute. Dwight left his cell phone on his desk. So, naturally, I paired it to my headset. Okay, fine, I'll just let it go to voice mail. - Hello, this is Dwight. - Hey, is this Dwight? - Yes, it is. - Oh, my goodness, you sound sexy. Thank you. I've been working out. You're not talking to Dwight right now. You're talking to Jim. Pam, I'm over here. I'm confused. Disconnect that right now. - You give me your earpiece. - I can't do that. Unsanitary. You know what, fine. I will reprogram my phone to go to my office phone. Done. This is Dwight. And I forwarded his desk phone to mine. Oh, hello, mater. Good news, I've married. Tell fater. Such a nice woman. Episode 4x14 "GOODBYE, TOBY" (1.00) Today is Toby Flenderson's last day. I couldn't sleep last night. I came in extra early. So much energy. There are certain days that you know you'll remember the rest of your life. And I just have a feeling that today is one of those days. - Morning. - Mornin'. So here we go. Just a matter of hours now until his horribleness has left the building. I'm going to set my watch alarm And Good morning, Kelly. I can't believe this is your last day. How do you feel? Fine. Good. I feel weird. First thing on the agenda. Actually, the only thing on the agenda is that status of Toby's going away party. We have a buttercream cake and a slide show of Toby. But so far we only have two pictures of him. Okay, well, this will not do. Toby is going away forever, and we need to do something very, very special. In some cultures, when somebody leaves, like New Orleans culture, they have a parade, and they have a band. And people party in the streets. Do you mean leaves as in dies? You want us to throw Toby a New Orleans funeral? If the devil were to explode, and evil were gone forever, what sort of party would you have? - Michael - Like a beach blowout? - Or a toga - No, you know No! - Toga! - You always do this. We have a nice, modest party planned, and you come in and demand the world. Let me be clear. There is simply no money for anything other than a cake, and to develop a few more slides. Although Toby won't be in them. I thought that you might say that. Every year, my sweet, sweet grandmother sends me a check on my birthday for $50. And lately she has been sending me, like, nine or ten checks a year. As Nana starts to But I knew I should be saving it for something. I just didn't know what I should be saving it for. And then I had an awakening. Michael, buy a motorcycle. So I put the money in my shoe, and then I forgot about it until now. I want a party that makes me feel like I'm flying through the air without this ugly weight holding me down. You know? I want an antigravity machine. I saw it in a movie. You drink a potion, and then you just start floating all around. So how much antigravity potion do you want? No, you know what? This is not a party-planning committee anymore. And I don't want your foot money, and I feel uncomfortable participating. Phyllis. Can you do this? Yes. - Hi, can I help you? - Hi, yes. I'm Holly Flax. I was told to ask for Mr. Flenderson. As part of my last day, I'm training the new human resources rep in the ways of the company. Again, the company has allotted for this training one day. So this is H.R. This is your desk. I love the view. Yeah, it's great, isn't it? Hey. Hey. What? Guess who just got into the Pratt school of design. No way! What'd I say? I said that they'd love those sketches. - Congrats. - Oh, thank you. I don't know why I doubted it. Because I'm so clearly awesome. Yes. So when do you start? I didn't read it carefully. I just saw "congratulations," and skimmed the list. I saw my name, I came in here to tell you and get a snack. Busy morning. So you know, it means I have to go to New York for three months. It's not a big deal. I'll come visit you. And you'll visit me. It's only two hours away. It'll be fine. - It's gonna suck, but it'll be great. - Yeah, it sucks, but it'll be great. See how easy that is? I wouldn't go if things weren't so solid with Jim. And down the road, if we have a family, I couldn't go then either. So the timing's perfect. And that is the first time I've ever used the word "perfect" in here. Hey, Stanley. I want to introduce you to Toby's replacement. So what do we know about her? Well, we know that Toby thinks she'll be great. Oh, strike one. I hate her already. I hate her too. Why do you hate her? Because she stinks with her ways and her head. You know, Dwight, sometimes I don't know, I think you say things just to agree with me. - Would that be such a bad thing? - Yeah, it would. Just have a thought. Have an original thought! Although I will agree that her head is weird. - You know what we need to do? - What? - We need to sell her an elevator pass. - But our elevator doesn't require a Exactly. A little old-fashioned hazing. Hi, are there any local companies that rent antigravity machines? - Antigravity machines? - That's right, yeah. What do they do, exactly? They make you feel lighter. Antigravity Antidepressant? I could put you through to someone on that. Okay. Yeah. - Hey, Michael? - Oh, hey, do you still work here? I'd like to introduce you to my replacement. - Come on. - No. I think I'll pass. Michael Scott, this is Holly. - Hi. - Hi, yeah, right. Okay, well, they hired a female Toby. Good for the world. Thank you, god, for creating two of you. Here's how things work here. My job is to make the office fun, your job is to make the office lame. And we have an eternal struggle, you and I. And only one of us can be the winner. Spoiler alert I'm gonna win. Man, someone doesn't like H.R. Yeah. - What did you do to him? - Nothing. T No, he tortured me with his awfulness. Yeah, I know what you mean. I nearly fell asleep when he gave me a tour of the files. Well, look, I'll let you get back to work, but I really look forward to working with you, Mr. Scott. You can p Michael. Thanks to Toby, I have a very strong prejudice against human resources. I believe that the department is a breeding ground for monsters. What I failed to consider, though, is that not all monsters are bad. Like E.T. Is Holly our extraterrestrial? Maybe. Or maybe she's just an awesome woman from this planet. - The pleasure is all mine. - Oh, thanks. I'm really looking forward to sitting down with you and finding out more - about what you do here. - Any time. What do you do here? Excuse me. What is wrong with this woman? She's asking about stuff that's nobody's business. What do I do? Really, what do I do here? I should have written it down. "Qua" something. Qua Quar Quibo Qual Quir Quabity. Quabity assuance. No. No, no, no, no. But I'm getting close. Have you been introduced to Kevin? No. Which one's Kevin? He's here on a special work program. He's slow, you know, in his brain. - Oh, good for you guys. - Yeah Hazing is a fun way to show a new employee that she is not welcome or liked. Accounting department, listen up. Holly, human resources. - Angela, Oscar, and Kevin. - Hello. Hello. Hi. Hi. What do you do? I do the numbers. Oh, good for you. Do you want an M&amp;M;? Oh, no, that is so sweet. But thank you, though. Yeah, I keep them here at my desk so that everybody doesn't take them. Well, that is a very safe place for them. - Yeah. - Here she is. Holly. You know, if we hung Holly from the ceiling, we'd have to kiss underneath of her. So I know. Sorry. Question. Are you real, or are you a Hollygram? Nice. I've never heard that one before, actually. - That's good. - I bet. Are these guys boring your ears off? No, no, I What is your commute like? How long does it take to get in? You know, I should make you a mix. Do you have a CD player? Yeah. - All right. - Thanks. Great. Do you like it? It's a photo of everyone in the office. So you can take it to Costa Rica. - You're You're not in it. - Well, I was taking the picture. I love it. I love it. I would love a picture of the two of us to also take to Costa Rica. - Sure, do you have a camera here? - No Does anyone have a camera here? No one has a camera here. I'm gonna I'll go get one. Stay. So I just got the fax. Closing the sale, and it's big. - It is really big. - Congratulations. Don't interrupt. Congratulations on doing your job. - You put the sale on the web site? - No, I didn't. I just logged it in. Try to be a team player here, Jim. Log it in the web site. - Well, it already went through, so - Don't worry about that. Just re-log it. Hello? Hike up your skirt a little more Jim? - I am downloading some n3p music - That's not it. Yeah. - for a cd mix tape for Holly. - Close. And I'm looking for perfect songs that work on two levels. What are the two levels? The two levels being welcome to Scranton and I love you. Okay, let's start with the "I love you" level. Hey, what's the group that was from Scranton that made it big? - Was that U2? - Yes. You don't love Holly. - I think I do. - But you just met her. Well, it was love at first sight. Actually, it was No. It was when I heard her voice. It was love at first see with my ears. Oh okay, it doesn't work like that. Well, you're not a romantic. Actually, I think I am, and I've a little bit of experience in office romance. - Oh, really? Like, with who? - Yeah. - We've been through this. - Pam? Yes, we are still dating. And guess what. I took it slow. Yeah, you took it too slow. - Well, we're really happy. - This thing with Holly feels a lot like love to me. And that's really sweet. And you can think that, but you don't say that out loud. And you definitely don't say it to her. I don't want her to get away. I know. Here, Michael, you can court her as you get to know her, you know? I mean, the office is a great place for that. Pam and I, we got to know each other right out there. I mean, first time we joked around was at my desk. And the first meal we ever had was in the break room, actually. We were at two separate tables and I remember that. The first time we kissed even was right outside, and Look. All I'm saying is that you can get to know someone really, really well, like I did Right here at work. I was thinking fireworks for the party. What do you think? Oh, boy, I appreciate your help, but I can't Oh, no. I just meant I wanted to pay to have fireworks at the party. Why would you do that? Because I'm gonna miss Toby. Yep, he's a heck of a guy, and I think we should send him off right. It doesn't matter. Here you go. Really? Well, we all want a good party, right? I'm going to propose tonight. Holy crap! - Hey, Kevin. - Hi. Do you need some help? I can't decide what to get. Well, what do you like to eat? Well, I like pretzels, but I really like chips. Well, how much money do you have there? Okay, let's see. This is a button. Okay, you have 75 cents. So that means you could get anything up on the top row. I am totally gonna bang Holly! She is cute and helpful, and she really seems into me. Hey, Ryan, it's Jim. I don't know what you got lately, but you know what, I really don't care because you're trying to get rid of me. And I bet you think I don't care enough about this job to actually fight back, but you're wrong, because I do, and I will. So you can keep trying to push me out of this place, but guess what I'm not going anywhere. Damn it! Hello, Holly. What are you doing? You don't You don't have to do that. I mean, we have already put-together chairs. That's how we buy them, actually. I'm trying to adjust the lumbar support on Toby's chair, and that made this up/down lever thing not work. And then I took the whole chair apart, and that is the story of me on the floor. It's pretty good, right? I'm gonna sell the movie rights. And the sequel, woman stands at desk and works. So, I have no idea how you How you sit like that. Yoga. Sit on floor and put together chair we will. Yo-da. Pass curvy metal piece you will. So are you in town this weekend? 'Cause I'm not I'm not I'm not gonna be in town. I'm going out of town. So you can't make my orgy? Kidding. Kidding. Acting! - Acting! - Acting! Lovitz. Yeah. I did it. - What'd you do? - I talked to her Holly. Just pleasantries. Nothing, you know, not like, do you want kids? Or religion or what side of the bed do you want? Hey, I can take either side of the bed at this point. - Okay, so how'd that feel? - It was hard. I wanted to kiss her. Oh, I'm so glad you didn't. Oh, god. Laying a base. - Laying a base. - There you go. There's plenty of base laying left, right? Yeah. Hello, Angela. Phyllis, you look like you're gonna have a heart attack. Could I get a list of your vendors? - I shredded it. - Why would you do that? Gosh, I just don't know. Why do you think? Sorry. What'd you guys do? Oh, there he is. Thought you had gone home already. Why don't you go home and come back for the party? Well, we still have to do the exit interview. Yes, we do. I'll let you in on a little secret. I've been looking forward to this moment. Very, very much. I I have been steeped in anticipation. Toby has been cruisin' for a bruisin' for 12 years, and I am now his cruise director. And my name is captain Bruisin'. - Thanks, Michael. I didn't expect - Can I just say that of all the idiots in all the idiot villages in all the idiot worlds, you stand alone, my friend. - Hello. - Hey! - Hi, good to see you. - You too. I'm just having a little exit interview. Yeah, I know. That's why I'm here. No, no. This is very boring stuff. Why don't you take a tour? Have you seen the bailer? No, no, I'll look at it later. It's part of my job. Okay. - Did you need me to take notes? - Hi, Pam. Stay. Okay. All right. Well then, I will proceed. I just have some questions that I was gonna ask. Who do you think you are? I'm Toby. Yeah. Correct. What gives What What gives you the right? I brought the binder. Do you wanna take a little look? Sure, you know what, that sounds good. I'll take a little looksie. - Here we go. - Thank you. "What would you improve "about Dunder Mifflin?" This place - No, no, no, no, no, no, no. - I've got some ideas. I'm not asking it, I'm just reading it out loud. Oh, I'd like to hear the answer. Well, let me see. I would I'll kill you. I guess everything's okay. I made it this far, right? What's the point? Why don't you open your present? This might not be what I think that I don't even know's in there 'cause there are a lot of presents in my car, and I don't know which is which. "Suck on this." - What the hell is that? - Michael What do you mean "Michael"?! That's not even my handwriting. Hey! What the hell is going on here?! Who thought it would be hysterical to give Toby a rock for his going-away gift?! - You did. You made me wrap it. - No! I thought it was over the line. I just You know what that is? You know what that is? That is a psyche. Psyche. So, that is not my real gift to Toby. - So what is your gift? - My gift is forthcoming, Pam. What is it? I am going to give Toby Your watch? Yes, I am. That was it. How did you know that? - I just knew. - How did you know? Oh, that is so sweet. Well That's my watch. Thanks. I'm gonna set it to Costa Rica time. Hey, that's good. Hey, it's the kid. Look, look, look. It's the temp. Look. - Oh, my gosh. - It's the temp. - Is that the police? - Yes. This is what happened. Ryan's big project was the web site, which wasn't doing so well. So Ryan, to give the impression of sales, recorded them twice. Once as office sales, and once as web site sales. Which's what we refer to in the business as misleading the shareholders. Another good term is fraud. The real crime, I think, was the beard. Oh, my god. Ryan. Oh, my god. I cannot wait to visit Ryan in prison. I'm gonna wear my hottest track suit and get my hair done. And then be, like, "Hi, Ryan." And then all the other prisoners are gonna be like, "Damn! "Ryan, you got a hot ex-girlfriend. "I would never have treated her so bad when I was outside of prison." Would you do me a favor and connect me to Ryan? Absolutely. Right to voice mail. Hey, Ryan, it's Jim. You know what? Totally disregard that last voice mail because you obviously have your hands tied. Good luck. What's protocol on this? Well, I normally do nothing, I guess. You shouldn't Michael, are you okay? I'm just worried about my friend. Of course you are. Just I'm fine. I'm holding it together. I have a business to run. I'm cool. No, hey, stop. You can let yourself be upset. He's your friend. You know what I usually find? Holly is sweet and simple. Like a lady baker. I would not be surprised to find out that she had worked in a bakery before coming here. She has that kind of warmth. I'm pretty sure she's baked on a professional level. Cool! A bouncy house! Kevin, take your shoes off first. No anti-gravity machine, huh? Sorry, Michael. I don't think they're real. The ferris wheel is pretty cool, though. Look at our parking lot. Yeah, who'd have thought? Is Jim gonna propose tonight? He is, isn't he? No, he's not. Is he? Oh, it was a pretty good company, but I just couldn't see a future there. They kept hiring from the outside. It was easy to get in, but impossible to rise up. That's what she A lot of places are like that. I think it's really cool you hired Kevin. Thanks. - You have it? - Almost. Here we go, here we go. Put it in. That that's my car. What are you doing? - What the hell's going on here?! - Nothing you need to know. - There is a raccoon in the car, Dwight! - No, there's not. - Why did you do that? - It was playful hazing. No, there's no such thing as playful hazing. Dwight, I want you to look at Holly now. Everybody, I want you to look at Holly right now. And maybe if you look at her deeply enough, you'll see what I see in her. And that is that we are all very lucky to have her here. Holly is the best thing that has happened to this company since World War II. She is the best. - Take care of that, all right? - It's not rabid. - Thanks for bringing that up. - Get it out, come on, get it out. I'm really sorry. Michael, thank you so much for saying that. I feel so welcome here. I just Excuse me. Did you see that? Did you see it? Did you see what Well, Jan didn't believe in showing affection, so sometimes I don't know how to react to when a girl touches me. I like it. Mrs. Vance, we're all out. Kev, I need you to do me a solid and go buy some more barbecue sauce. Okay. Cool. You drive your own car? Yup, this is my car. Do you drive your own car? Yep, just like you. Okay, bye. Bye. I'm really proud of you. All right. Let's hear it for Darryl and his band. You know what? Let's also give a shout out to Phyllis for this awesome party, huh? Probably the best one that we have ever had, right? But the real reason that we are here is to say good-bye to a guy who we will probably never ever see again. Now, a lot of you know that I am an accomplished songwriter. Song parody writer. I have done things like Beers in heaven. - Classic. - Or Total eclipse of the fart. - Not my favorite, but - I love to sing them, but I am not going to be doing that today. I am going to be doing something I wrote specifically for Toby. Do you know  - Goodbye stranger, Supertramp? - Yeah. It was early morning yesterday I was up before the dawn and I really have enjoyed my stay but Toby must be moving on I'm gonna miss Toby. He has a nice, calming presence in the office. Goodbye, Toby it's been nice hope you find your paradise Don't tell him I said this, but I always thought he was kinda cute. Come tomorrow feel no pain Feel no pain Toby's goin' away! See ya! See ya, Toby, see ya! He's outta here. Goodbye, Toby - Not bad. - Oh, hey. Thanks. Someday I would love to hear Beers in heaven. Oh, okay. Yeah. Well, actually, too soon. It's It's very sexual. Sorry. Kevin. Kevin, where are you? You missed my song, buddy. Yeah, Michael, I'm at Gerrity's. You have to come down here. Just pay for it and we'll reimburse you when you get back. No, I brought my money. There's something that you need to see. - What is it? - Just hurry. - Is he okay? - Yeah, he needs me at the supermarket. The party, driving to the supermarket It was a big day for him. Yeah, that's true. Don't move a muscle. I will be back momentarily, all right? No, you can Finish your drink and then I'll I'll be back. - It was good to see you. - It was great to see you, Jan. Okay. - Hello, Jan. - Hello Michael. Kevin, really? We're Sorry, we're in the middle of a party. Is this why you called me? Yeah, Michael, I just I think you kids have a lot to catch up on. - Oh, okay. - Yeah. Thanks, Kevin. I can't believe it! Look at you! - Are you nauseous? - No. Do you Do you have cravings? You never touched my Propecia or my Accutane? - No, I didn't touch that. - Good. Thank god. 'Cause that's Wow, I'm so happy. I am so deliriously happy. - Why? - Because you're pregnant. And because it obviously happened when we were together, and - I am very proud - Yeah, it did happen when we were together. That's true. But you are not You're not the dad. You cheated on me? - When I specifically asked you not to? - No, I did not I did not cheat on you. I did not. Well okay. Okay. So it's not mine, and it's not somebody else's, so I know the whole toilet seat thing is a myth, so I went to a sperm bank. You did? - When we were going out? - Yeah. I don't understand. You always used to be very cautious. - I'd wear two condoms. - I know. You'd rather have somebody else's sperm than mine? No, no, no. It's not just any sperm bank. I mean, it's really This is a really, really great place. It's amazing, actually. I'm gonna bring you the catalogue. You should look through it. It's And it's a fact, it's right next to that little breakfast place that you like in the city where you can draw on the tables. Ihop. Ihop. If I was 22 and I had lots of time to have lots of children, then sure, let's let Michael have a shot at one. But honestly, I need to make this one count. That's really good. I feel so much better. I just needed to get all of that out onto the table. I'm glad you told me. I don't know what you're gonna be doing tomorrow, but I have my lamaze class in Allentown. And you could come. I usually, you know, use a foam noodle instead of a partner. I've to think about it. Okay. My whole life, I have known two things. I love sex, and I want to have kids. And I always thought that those two things would go hand in hand. But now, I think it might be one or the other. Oh, look they're starting. Well, I hope you had fun today. 'Cause you're never ever throwing a party again. Can I have your attention, please? I was waiting for the right time to do this, and I can't think of a better time than right now, with the music playing, and all our friends around, and the fireworks going off. My parents are here Andrew and Ellen Bernard. Thank you for sharing in this joyous moment. Miss Angela Martin, will you please join me onstage? Okay, then I will come to you, my flower. Damn it! Angela Will you do me the honor Of giving me your tiny hand in marriage? Okay. Into the mike, sweetie. I said okay. She said yes! And the crowd goes wild! I've been carrying that ring around in my wallet for six years. Because you don't know when you're gonna meet the right girl and the moment's gonna be right. And tonight, with the fireworks and the music and everything it was right. Can I be your bridesmaid? No. Well It's my own fault. Tuna! I'm engaged! I know. That's awesome, man. That's great. Mr. Andrew Bernard. It's got a nice ring to it. Hey. Hey, you know, I just realized I don't have a picture of the two of us. Oh, yeah - Yeah. Could we? - Sure. Meredith, do you mind? - This one right here. - Okay. One, two, three. Oh, let's do it again. Pam, your smile is weird. It's digital, so just take as many as you want. One, two, three. One, two, three. I don't know, I just I really thought Jim was gonna propose tonight. - Hey there. - Hey. - So, you missed something really big. - Yeah? Andy proposed to one of your accountants. I'm not so specific as I can be on my first day, but Well, I can see Andy proposing to Angela. I can also see him proposing to Oscar. So You know, somehow, after all those ribs, I'm still really hungry. I don't know, I was thinking of maybe going off-campus somewhere and getting some dessert. Well, you know what? You should go to the Glider Diner. Ask Stanley about that. He practically lives there. Okay. I'll go to the diner with you. That would be great. Yeah, we can go eat pie. I love pie. - Me too. - Okay. - Have a good night. - Okay. Good night. Yeah, it was a good day. I mean, first day's are always the hardest, right? Well, I should go. I gotta buckle him in. Well, this is it. - I am here to see you off. - Thanks. Really, Michael? Sorry, corporate policy. - It's not. - You might take something. - Don't think he's gonna take anything. - Okay, security guard. Oh, some kind of alarm. Okay. Hi, Jan, it's Michael. I just I just want to let you know that I am going to go to your lamaze class tomorrow. And if there is any details you need to fill me in on, like what, exactly, lamaze is, that would be great. And I will see you tomorrow morning. I am going to be kind of a daddy. Party planning's a real high. Like a runner's high. - Oh, my god! - What?   What's this? Looks like a red wire. That wasn't here before. It's a computer, Dwight. I mean, computers have wires. Yours doesn't. Doesn't it? It's going in a different direction than the other wires. I'm really busy. I can't talk about this anymore. - Just shut up, Phyllis. - Get outta here. What are you doing? I got 500 feet of red wire at a flea market up by Dunmore High School. Crazy. What a deal. He'll be fine. I made it up there. Proofreading: So. &amp; Valpi Episode 5x12 "Prince Family Paper" What you talking about, Wallace? Hi, Michael. How are you? - I'm well. How are you? - Very good. So, listen, we haven't yet filled the regional supervisor job. Have you not? Correct, and I was wondering if I could get you to do the fieldwork that would normally go to the supervisor. OK, there's an area from Carbondale to Marshbrook where we've never done any business. There's a small company there, Prince Paper. I can't get a report on it because it's not a public company. But we've been talking about going after their market. So I was hoping you could do some fact-finding for me. I'll fax over some of the things we're looking for. Fax? Why don't you just send it over on a dinosaur? This is important, Michael. Then e-mail it, David. - You've got no taste, Stanley Hudson. - I do. - What are you talking about? - Some actress. Whether she's hot. - Who's the gal in question? - Hilary Swank. - Not at all. - She's got mean eyes. - Have you seen her with her bangs? - She looks like a monster. She is a beautiful movie star. So, maybe we should just go to work. - She is an amazing actress. - But that's not the question. - She's not hot. - Thank you, Phyllis. Why don't we just put this to a vote? Then we'll be done with it. - I'm not voting. - No one cares. Who thinks that Hilary Swank is hot, raise your hand. And who thinks that Hilary Swank is not hot, raise your hands. Five. Five to five. - Thank you, accounting department. - So what do we do now? What if the owner of Prince Family Paper has a beautiful daughter and we have to seduce her to get their secrets? - I will seduce her. - No, I wanna seduce her. - Let me seduce her. Michael, please - No I got it. - You'll fall in love with her. - Yeah. So what if I did? That would take precedence, and I would expect your support. Let's go over the plan again. I'm a local business owner. I need to buy paper. I find out everything about their prices and policies. - Your fictious name? - Michael Scarn. I am a paper salesman looking for a new job. I find out everything about their expenses and salaries. Then we meet at Denny's, and we compare notes. No, I never said Denny's. Ihop. No, I said Denny's. You know how I feel about Ihop. - Don't start. - Are you a socialist? I don't want to get into this debate again. - I enjoy Ihop. - I'll have a cup of coffee. You will have pancakes, and you'll like it. - The store next to them is for lease. - So what? It means they're not expanding. Maybe they're shrinking. They could be shrinking. Because the sign is centered perfectly above their store. No sign of the sign being moved. It's lunchtime. But no sign of anyone coming in or out, which means they're not taking new customers out to lunch. They're not acquiring new business. So once again, no growth. And there are clouds. Clouds in the sky. That means it's gonna rain. Bad for business. It would if they were altocumulus, not cirrostratus. Why do you OK. - Whatever. Shut up. - Get your clouds right. You go in now, I'm gonna go in in exactly ten minutes. We have never met each other. We are complete strangers. We're gonna need a signal to bolt outta there in case there is danger. And that signal is Lick your lips. Try it. No, like this. Good. Ready to do this? All right. Here come the sharks. In nature, there's something called the food chain. It is where the shark eats the little shark, and the little shark eats the littler shark. And so on until you get down to the single-cell shark. So now, replace sharks with paper companies. And that is all you need to know about business. How can I help you? My name is Michael Scarn. I am a local business owner, and I would like to find out about your company. Please come in. - What kind of business are you in? - We're a law firm. I assume your primary paper needs are stationery, general office. I'll be honest with you about something. Where I used to live, our paper supplier had a lot of big clients, and I just didn't feel like a priority. So, I guess my question to you would be, how many clients do you have? - About 80. - Really? That many? This doesn't seem like a very big operation. It's just me, my wife and my son. So when When did you set up shop? I opened this place after I came back from Vietnam. Vietnam. I hear it's lovely. Each side will have three minutes to prepare opening arguments. Topic. - Hilary Swank is attractive. - Hot. The debate is whether she's hot. What difference? Attractive, hot We're talking about the same thing here. Huge difference. A painting can be beautiful, but I don't want to bang a painting. OK! T.M.I. So even specialty paper, say 94 brightness double-bonded, you would put that on the same truck as your conventional stock? You sure know a lot about paper for a lawyer. That is because I am a genius. Really? Well, about some things. And other things, I'm just I'm very stupid. Like watch this. Is this the cup? Is this the cup? Is this what I drink out of? Laughter is my job. Tears are my game. Law is my profession. I'd like to apply for a job. I'm afraid we're not hiring right now. Why don't you just get rid of this guy? That's my son. I'm your son now. You can visit him on holidays. Dwight Schrute. I'm a paper salesman at a second-tier paper company called Dunder Mifflin. I'm the top salesman there, and I'm looking for a new challenge. I would say you guys have what? - 40 high-volume clients? - Try 80. I've got 90 clients myself. Better look out. Someone might run you out of business. I sure hope not. Me too. I think all of us have a tendency to view celebrities as sort of mythical figures. We don't really see them as real, so therefore, we don't judge them as real people. Are you serious? Jim, just show us a picture. - Come on. - Shut up, Kevin. But he's making all these fancy - It's a gut thing. - That's fair. Kev, do me a favor. Why don't you close your eyes? Now imagine that Hilary Swank comes into this office for real. She walks over to you and she says, "Kevin Malone, "I just read your online profile "and there's nothing I'd rather do than make out with you right now." Now you tell me something Is she hot? Does that end the debate? Or What are you doing? It's "is she hot?", not "would you do her?" Respect the game. This close. So why are you considering leaving Dunder Mifflin? My boss. Do tell. His insensitivity could border on the cruel. This is a man who does not listen to the needs of his underlings. - He's way - How's the interview going? - Very well. - Don't blow it. Linda, can I get a picture of you? - You want a picture of me? - I would. Could you just stand right over here? That would be great. Just something to remember the trip by. Just a little to your left. There you go. Good. - Perfect. - Can I have a copy of that? Grandma, I can't do this. What's going on? Little homework over here? - Let's see if I can help. - Right there. Math. That's not so hard. There are four of these. Ignore the parenthesis, right? Why is this little two so small? It's weird. You just don't Just go by the "x." The "x" means "times." So that means four times x-two. What is double four? - Eight. - Right. Excellent. Way to go. Nice. Don't put that. Ladies and gentlemen, even though the penis was fake, I kept expecting a second plot twist where we found out that Hilary Swank actually was a boy. I wasn't going to dignify this discussion by getting involved, and I don't even get the discussion. Hot is a temperature, people. But Kevin deserves to lose for what he said. So, yes She's hot. She's hot as heck. She's a female Boris Becker. Nice. Thank you very much for all of your help. Going to be an incredibly hard decision. Wait. Let me get something for you here. Here's some some references. Our top clients. You call any of them, I trust you'll hear some good things. - All right, thank you. - You're welcome. Excuse me, sir. I took the bus here and was wondering if I could catch a ride home with you. Of course. Thank you very much. Thanks for your time. I cannot wait to contact your clients. I look forward to getting your calls. Bye now. So long. We struck the mother lode! - Come on! - Wallace is gonna freak! He is going to absolutely freak. Someone's looking out the window. Go. Peel out. Go! Shoot. - We You drove over the thing. - I know. - God, what was that? - That's not good. Come on. She's hot. OK? Because if you are saying that Hilary Swank isn't hot, then you're saying I'm not hot, because, obviously, I'm not as hot as Hilary Swank. Darn it. - Come on. - Man. - My car! - Are you all right? - Not good. - Is everyone OK? - It sounded bad. - We're fine. We're fine. You folks have done enough already. You've done more than you could possibly know. Dwight, just shut We're just gonna call a tow truck. A tow truck is gonna charge you - Let me take a look. - No, you know He drove over the divider and then backed over it. It caused I'll be right back. I'm just gonna grab my tool box. Ladies, are we prepared to let the Kevins of the world decide anything for us? Anything at all? We don't even give him full Internet access. Wait, what? See that? The obvious symmetry of the face. It's the natural appeal of the scientific standard of koinophilia, features that are a composite average of many features. Yes, she's attractive, but she is not hot. How much longer is this gonna take? Let me give you some money for this. No, I sit all day. It's nice working with my hands. Coffee. That's too much nice. You're welcome. Disgusting. What is this, instant? That ought to do it. It's all better. Gosh, well, so long. - That looks great. - Drive safe. Look forward to hearing from you about that job application. Good-bye, Prince Family. Should be called the Sucker Family. "Here you go, shark. "Let me fix your fin for you and sharpen your teeth, "while I'm at it." Suckers. I'm just saying All I'm saying is Kevin's not necessarily a feminist. What will happen to that family if I call Wallace and give him this information? It's simple. Wallace would use that information to destroy them. Our sales are fine. We're doing fine. They're doing fine. - Could be better. - Why don't we live and let live? - Live and let live. - I'm not familiar with that. It's a James Bond It doesn't make any sense. Of course, I'm alive. - I'm not going to make this call. - Michael, you have to. Have you ever seen a lioness devour her cub? Have you ever seen a baboon devour its mate? Have you ever seen a racoon devour a squirrel? My heart says no. Your heart is a wonderful thing. But it makes some terrible decisions. That's true. - That's true. - Gosh. It has gone down the wrong path many, many times. Jan, Ryan Save your heart for love and use your brain for business. Right? If we don't do this to Prince Paper, then someone else will. Or worse yet someone else will do it to us. I am trying to be more optimistic in life. I've got, what? And my family history says I have less. Now the old Stanley Hudson would have found something to complain about with this actress. But that's no way to live life. Look at this healthy, sexy, pretty, strong young woman. Come on. She is hot. And it was a terrible war. So many died. Far too many died. But if Frodo hadn't destroyed the ring, then goodness itself might have died. You're right. You are right. I will call Wallace, and I will give him the customer list. And I will give him all of my info. You are doing the right thing. Good. So - Where are you going? - Just something I have to do first. - Where are you taking the client list? - Someplace safe where it can't hurt anyone. Michael, get back here! Don't do this! Shoot. Freeze. Stop. Give me the list! - I can't let you do this. - Those people will be ruined! It's business! It's not personal! Give it! Dwight, give it! We can't do this! Those people It's over, Michael. It's over. I'm not a shark. OK, time for the final vote. All those in favor of the resolution, "Hilary Swank is hot"? And all those opposed. - It's just ridiculous. - That's the thing. People just got entrenched in the view they had in the first place. I can tell when I was talking, you were not listening. This is great stuff, Michael. You are a titan of industry, pal. Good work. I'll be in touch. Thanks, buddy. Guess whose stock just went up, golden boy? I guess this is what they call a bittersweet moment. It is bitter because I slightly destroyed a wonderful little family. But sweet because David Wallace thought I did a good job. That's why I hate bittersweet chocolate. I don't even What's the point of that? Why not just sweet? I mean, who are you helping? - What is this? - Hilary Swank. She's hot. Damn it!   Could you please sign my expense report? No way, no how. Expense reports are a day-to-day item. That is jim's now. I am exclusively big picture, epic. - Sign this. - Ah, ah, ah. Where's the "please"? We're not animals. Sign it. No, not without a "please. " Idiot. I have a complaint about jim. That is not big picture. I would like to file a huge, enormous, massive complaint about the tallest guy in our office. Okay. Jim won't sign my expense report. That is not Okay - That is day-to-day. - No, that his huge. - You're trying to trick me. Get out, get out, get out. - This has to do Get out, get out. I'd like to lodge a complaint. I'm sorry to hear about that. Who is this about? - You! - Okay. Just want to let you know I take complaints very seriously. So When did this happen? - One minute ago. - Okay. And how do you feel? - Angry. - - All right. Did he hit you? - No. - Did you cry? - No. - Did you feel like crying? - No. - I'm just gonna write, "held back tears. " Wait, stop writing that. That is not true. If you stop crying, i'll stop writing it. I'm not cr Uhh! I deserved that promotion, not jim. Oh, man. Makes me want to put him in a triangle choke hold and force him down to the ground and just keep pressing and pressing. And then flip him over and then put him in a hammer lock. And he's gasping, he's panting. Every last breath. And the crowd is going crazy. And boom! I emerge victorious! Aha! $18,000 and a chance at the title. Ooh hah! Dwight, jim wants you to keep it down. the Office s06e03 Everyone, now would be a good time to freshen up, because I'd like everyone to meet in the conference room in five minutes. And I suggest that you bring a snack, because we may be in there for a while. - Michael - Yes? - Can I talk to you in my office for a second? - Mmm, sure, but could I first talk to you in my office? Can I also be a boss? Look, it doesn't take a genius to know that any organization thrives when it has two leaders. Go ahead, name a country that doesn't have two presidents. A boat that sets sail without two captains. Where would catholicism be without the popes? I have noticed that we Welcome. Thank you. I've noticed we've been having a lot of conference room meetings. And I'm wondering if perhaps those are a bit, um - Disruptive. - Yes. No, I don't think they are. I think the meetings are very important. Okay, maybe we should talk specifics. - Let's do. - Okay. Yesterday, we had a meeting about planets. N Well, to be fair, jim James Jimothy To be fair, jimothy, the Ah, that sounds weird. Are you okay with being called jim? - I am. - All right. Jim, to be fair, - the conversation wasn't about planets - Right. At first. We were talking about introducing a line of toilet paper. And what part of the human body does one use toilet paper upon? So you draw a line from there to the other planets, and I think by the end, we all learned a little bit about how small we are. - Yes, I agree. - Because it's a big universe, and we're all just little, tiny specks of dust. I just think that maybe they're eating large amounts of the day. You know what eats a large amount of the day are naps. You go to sleep, it's light out, you wake up, it's dark. That's the whole day. Where did that day go? I have no idea. You mean on a weekend. Yes. How about this? I think our goal should be we don't have meetings unless they're absolutely essential. All right. No more meetings this week. Really? You just agree to that? I can be very surprising. What's going on? I need to fit into my wedding dress. However, I'm also pregnant. You know, it's a myth that women have to gain more than nine pounds in a pregnancy? Look at these actresses. Some of them lose weight. Hey, did you guys register for wedding gifts? We did, but mostly because people expect us to. We're also accepting other gifts not on the registry However much. It's awkward asking people for money, but we could really use it. Why doesn't crate &amp; barrel let you register for a toaster full of cash? Perfect. I hate registries. Oh, good. My cousin makes the most amazing romantic birdhouse mailboxes. I know I shouldn't tell you, but you'll still be surprised when you see it. You're not registered for a birdhouse, are you? No, we're not. Good. Good. Mm-hmm? Okay, I thought I saw people missing. Yeah, just focus-grouping a product expansion idea to these folks. - Got one of each. - Really? Hey, stanley, what was the last thing michael said before I came through the door? - Stanley, you don't need to answer that. - Stanley? "If you don't smell this, you're fired. " Okay, michael, I thought we agreed to not take up people's time with meetings like these. What do you mean by "these people"? Michael, this is a conference room meeting. Oh, hey, everybody, I think that jim has gone insane, because he thinks that my office is a conference room. - That's not what I meant. - Listen, jim, no offense, but when push comes to shove, what I want is more important than what you want. - I disagree. - What do you guys think? - ??? - ???? Great. Guys, can I just have a moment alone with michael? No, no, no, you don't need to go anywhere. Anything that jim has to say to me, he can say in front of these types of people. That is not what I said, and, also, I am co-manager, meaning you are not the only manager anymore. I am also a co-manager. That is not what wallace told us. That's exactly what wallace told us. That is not the way I heard it. I love rivalries Michael or jim, paris or nicole, heidi or I.c. It's so much fun. But I guess if i'm really thinking about it and answering your question honestly, i'd have to go with I.c. Heidi's a bad friend, and her skin is terrible. It is one thing, me giving you the co-manager title. It is another thing, you bossing me around. I'm not bossing you around. I'm trying to do my job, which is sharing your job, so maybe we should just call david wallace. No, no, no. No, we will not call david wallace. I will call david wallace. David wallace is on line two for you guys. Or david wallace will call us on line two. Why don't we just - Hey, david. You got jim here. - This is michael, senior co-manager. Hey, guys, um, I'm calling, because, unfortunately, we will not be able to give out cost of living raises this year, and I know people expect it. However, there just is only a small amount of money for each branch, so we're leaving it up to the managers to decide how to distribute it. Got it, dave. Sounds like your classic big-picture decision. Which will clearly affect the day-to-day well-being of our employees. It's probably a little of both. - Which is it more of? - Excuse me? David, I know that I'm very new at this, but I have a very good perspective on how things work. Wait, I'm sorry. Michael, are you Are you texting me? I thought maybe we could talk after this is over. Look, I need you both to take care of this. This is not going to be a problem, is it? - Nope, not at all. - No, it will not be. - I am on top of it. - Very good. - Thanks a lot, david. - Talk to you later Okay, you didn't let me say good-bye. All right, I am looking forward to this. - You don't have to lie. - I hate the fact that we have to do this together. I think we work much better separately. When I am irritated and I look at you, - I don't see you anymore. - alright All I can see is how big and gross the pores on your nose are. All right. Let's get started. Hey, why haven't we ever, um We have. You know, there's no easy way to do this. I say we add 1.5% to their paychecks and don't say anything about it. Do you mean, like break in in the middle of the night and change the numbers on payroll? No, we can do it during the day. It doesn't have to be that dramatic, jim. Okay. You know what would help is a pros and cons list for our options. Jim, don't take this the wrong way. Are you gonna take this the wrong way? It's hard to tell so far. You use your brain too much. Are you advocating that I use it less? Sometimes the smartest people don't think at all. - You just came up with that. - As I was saying it. Okay, so for the 1.5% increase, pro Everyone gets a little bit. Con You look like a nerd. Con No one gets as much as they did last year. Pro You get to share your pros and cons list with the other nerds. Pro No favoritism. Con You unzip your pants, and you find that there's a calculator down there. I've been studying michael for years, and I've condensed what I've learned into this chart How michael spends his time. As you can see, we have procrastinating and distracting others, and this tiny sliver here is critical thinking. I made it bigger, so that you could see it. Hey, pam, I heard that you were registered, but I didn't hear where. I don't think we registered anywhere. We just want cash. Like money? Like you You want my money? Mm-hmm. Will you take a check? Yeah. Cool. In the memo line, i'm gonna write, "to love's eternal glory. " Okay. Wait till monday. Is this what I've become? Materialistic? Shallow? I feel horrible. Oh, look! "mrs. Pam halpert!" that's the first time I've seen it in writing. You know, the more I think about it, the more I think we should give it to the salesmen. That will not go over well. I know. I just think it seems smart to keep the salesmen happy right now. Course I know that this might come off as biased, so you know what? Let us Oh, my god, are you gonna make another pro and con list? I'm gonna kill myself. I'm not gonna let you stop me from thinking. No, I could not do that, jim. I can see it in your crusty little eyes that you are going to make everything perfect. If I can just think this through, if I could just think it exactly right, I can make this perfect, and then I can go down every avenue, and every avenue off of that avenue, - and then another avenue. And then another - Michael. - You have a lot of strengths. - Oh, I do? Tell me what they are. I think that you are able to take constructive criticism very well. Ha! That I am not known for that. But there is a reason why I'm here. Yes, you went over my head to wallace. No, it's because you also have a lot of weaknesses, michael. Okay. Well, why don't you tell me what those are, jim? Why don't you enliven me? I don't think you're good at making tough decisions. - Ah. - At thinking out the options, and then stating that decision very clearly, especially when it's an unpopular decision. Okay, here's a tough decision for you. - You suck. You suck. Is that clear enough for you? - wait, but maybe I'm here for a reason, because I might have some good ideas, too. I've been sitting out there, and I've been learning a lot, and maybe I can just bring something different to the table. Okay, skippy, here we go. Why don't you run yourself out there and tell them? You call it. This had better be terrible. Could I have everyone's attention, please? I have some tough news, so I'm just gonna give it to you straight. Truth is, we only have so much money for raises this year, so the simple fact is some people will get raises and some people won't. Now, what we've decided is, we are gonna give those raises to the sales staff. Wait. Seriously? Look, you guys are smart, so I'm just leveling with you. I'm just trying to treat you like adults. Thank you, jim, for thinking that we're smart people. But I do not understand. If we're such smart adults, then why don't we get raises? Excellent question, genius. It's because jim wants to give the raises to his friends and the people he sleeps with. - Ooh, easy. That's not it at all. - ??? - Really what it is is about the money the sales staff brings into the office. - What's going on? Jim is only giving raises to the salesmen. What the hell? Why are you being such a jerk? Hold on, kelly. Would it help you to know that jim thinks you're smart? No. How is that gonna repair ryan's car? This is ridiculous! How could he do this to us? Okay, dwight, you know what? You'd be getting the raise so What about all these people, huh? How is it fair to them? - Exactly. - Totally. We work just as hard as the sales people. We deserve raises. - Yes. - Yes. They don't get 'em if we don't get 'em. My kid needs shoes! - You want to tell him he doesn't get shoes? - yeah Her kid needs shoes, jim! - What the hell? - ??? - ??? - ???? wow. I'm just gonna rewind and back off a bit, so ??? That was good. That was good. Okay, all right. Well, we all know it's hard to be a boss, right? You know what? Look around you. These are your best friends. These are the people who will open their hearts to you. They all have heart-ons for you, and that is a gift. So in terms of gifts, we should be giving each other gifts. Angela, yes, lend oscar a cup of sugar. - What are you talking about? Michael! - We just need to hear your plan for our raise. My plan A man Panama. That's not how that goes. You're not saying anything. At least jim was being direct. Thank you, meredith. When he was telling us his dumbass plan. We would just like to know what's happening. Are we getting a raise, yes or no? All right, let me get this clear. Does everybody want a raise? yes! All right, everyone wants a raise, so what we're going to do is go into here, and we will not come out until we do. Again, that gives us no information. This isn't a game, you know? It's our livelihood! What about a raise based on merit? - Rank each person individually. - Mm-hmm. Piece of cake. Ryan, obviously the best. Well, obviously. Too bad he's a temp and doesn't count, so let's get started. - Are you making a - Nope. I'm numbering the paper. - Just - Yeah, I don't understand how they can even consider giving money to some people and not the rest of us. It's not like we're not gonna see the checks. - We're in accounting. - I am so pissed at this company. - And jim. - Yeah. Who said that? - I think it was creed. - Yep. It's going really well, actually. Each boston baked bean represents half a percent raise, we each got 24 beans, so the idea is, you place the bean on the picture of who you think deserv Who's that? Toby. He's not a part of this. You know that. Just wanted to draw a picture of him. Okay, your move. All right, who to pick? - Who to pick? - Here we go. I will skip a turn. Okay, you're gonna still have to play that bean. You know that. I need more time. Wallace sent an e-mail about a meeting next week. He wants you both to respond. People are starting to notice how terrible jim is. It's great. Eventually, they'll rise up and revolt. My only hope is that they do it sooner rather than later. If the people here were our founding fathers, the revolutionary war would have been delayed ten years, because stanley washington was napping, and phyllis hancock was still signing the declaration, and kevin jefferson was distracted by a butterfly. Come on in. That's right. Come in, feast your eyes. They determine our worth by putting beans upon our faces. What the hell? Things were not this bad when just michael was manager. Hey, what are you guys doing in here? What does a bean mean? on this very old, frizzy-haired picture of me? Michael, what does a bean mean? Jim? I was just trying to be unbiased. What does a bean mean? Someone please explain it to kevin. Why can't you? My time is just as valuable as yours. Not according to the beans. This is how you make this important decision? There's no way that stanley gets more beans than me. That is ridiculous. This is how it works. It's not so much that I might not get a raise. It's just demeaning. Thank you. That is exactly By the way, I would also like a raise. Yeah, I would, too. Are we idiots? What right does jim have to claim authority, hmm? Is he as good a salesman as i? Is he as matronly as phyllis? There are moments where we can affect change. For a few seconds every decade, we exist, and these are those seconds. Let us storm his castle. Come on. Tick Let's get him. Tick And drag jim out of his office. Tock Take his keys away from him. Tick That's a clock. The time is getting very close. It's now or never. What say you? I say no. No, I mean, what do you say to my plan? - ??? - ??? okay. - ???? - ??? what does a bean mean? How you doing? Uh, on a scale of one to ten, i'd say I'm about a four. Oh, what are you usually? Six. You? Usually a ten, but I'm feeling like a zero. I mean, a performance-based raise sounded like a good idea, right? I know, I know. We tried to find the fairest way to do it. - Yes, we did. - I just What? Um, nothing. I just I used to have to do this part alone, and it was the worst. I have something I would like to give you. - michael! come on - ???? Michael's my only friend left in the office. Except pam I think. Is she still upset? - Michael! - Michael, you cannot just keep avoiding us like this! - Thank you. - You're welcome. What's in here? Gin. Ooh. Just pretend we're not here. Heard you guys are looking for cash for the wedding? Yeah, I mean, if it's all the same for you. Question for you. Would you guys rather have $100 now or $5,000 a year from now? $100 now for sure. Because you just give me $50 to cover the broker fee, I put in 100 of my own money as the gift Yeah. No, no, I'll, um The hundred. I'll just take the hundred. Instead of $5,000 a year from now? How sure is this? The guy has an algorithm to determine the winner of any given college basketball game. don't tell jim. # I got a big box, yes I do # # I got a big box, how 'bout you? # # I got a big box, yes I do # # I got a big box, how 'bout you? # I think you don't know what you're saying.

They stepped in at the 11th hour, And they saved our asses. Although david wallace said that we were the one branch That was actually working right, So we probably could have saved our own asses. We didn't need them touching our asses. Awesome. For accounting, A brand new printer. And for the sales staff, A new fax machine. This cord has "creed" written all over it. And whoever would like a brand new scanner Can come visit it in my office. Thank you. Here we go. Wow. Cool. What next? Guys, um, who's gabe?

Right? Mm. Did we try printer first? Shredder at an angle - Yep. - Fax, cable, - Then the scanner upside down? - Yes. Have you tried making everything smaller? And Really nice job. This group of people, When they put their minds together, They can do something great. And I think that you should all be proud of yourselves. Oh, Michael! All right. Relax. We can do it. We just did it. So we can do this again. Erin, scissor me, please. No, don't. - Thank you. - Oh, got it. Okay. All right. He's on his way up. Okay. Are we ready? What do you want us to do? Why do I have to explain everything? Because we're usually not on the same page. Okay. Oh. Okay. And to you. Gabe seems tall. Hope we get along. Had a very good thing going with david wallace.

But 70% of me is water, And the other part, the real part, The part that has feelings and emotions and thoughts And makes decisions, And, if I can be crass, makes babies, That part thinks that all of these changes Suck ba Really? You don't have enough water in there? Your stomach? What? Looks like we kicked it. I miss the old dunder mifflin. Too much change is not a good thing. Ask the climate. I don't want to appear ungrateful For everything sabre's doing for us. Oh, I don't get that sense at all from you, so Well, you should have a little. But it's great that you don't, Because I am trying to embrace all of these changes, But I'm I'll be honest, I'm having trouble wrapping my head Around a couple of 'em. Which ones? All of 'em. Well, I wish that I could do something, But it's kind of policy, you know? Above my pay grade. You know? So maybe we should call We should call someone. I could help. I'm good with bosses. Call one of the higher-ups? You know what? Let me see what I can do. Okay, this is officially the cutest thing I've ever seen. Cubbies. I totally forgot about cubbies. There's a finger-painting station And a curly slide. Am I too old to go here? Adorable, right? I walked in on someone in the bathroom. What? I just walked in on someone in the bathroom. - Who? The - I don't know. I don't know. The guy we're meeting with? I don't know. I don't know. I am telling you, There are no strawberries in here. Well, I saw them in there. Well, maybe they ran away, 'cause the pizza was like, "Hey, get out of here, You stupid strawberries." I think when andy finally asks me out He's gonna try to top what he did with the drum line. I can't wait to see what he comes up with. The ball's totally in Erin's court. After the whole drum line thing. First let me say I told them everything That you wanted me to say, In just the way you wanted me to say it, so Gabe, honey, I love this. I love the sound of your voice. But I really need some new information now. Okay, um, I told the story of your uncle, And I have a feeling that you would have really, uh, Really been proud of the way Okay, um Wait a minute. Who is it? Who's there? Is there somebody in the room with you? I want to see who it is. Turn me around. I don't It's just Turn me around. Now. Hey, buddy. Is it something I said? Hello. No. My name's Michael Scott. Hello. Oh, hello, mr. Scott. Pleased to meet you. Nice to meet you. We are very excited about the merger with sabre. I think you have a great accent. Aw, thank you. I've been working on it Since I was a little girl. To, um, to what do I owe the pleasure Of this video chat? Well, I'm a little concerned About all of these changes, To be quite frank. I think we have done things A certain way here At dunder mifflin for quite some time, and Pardon. Pardon me, Mr. Scott, But the last time I saw a company As mismanaged as dunder mifflin Was my grandson's snowball company, So you'll excuse me If I prefer that you all adapt To the way we do things. Okay. I feel very strongly That you can't just come in here And change everything That people have been doing forever. Is christian slater back there? BecauseHe knows. He'd know what to do. So listen. Why don't you tell gabe If by the end of the day You can't handle the changes. I have already told him, But I will tell him again if you think that'll help. I would take until the end of the day If I were you. Pam and Jim? Hey. I'm jerry. Hi, Jerry. - Jerry. - Good to see you. Come on in. My office is right back here. This is the play room. This is great. Got to confess, We came a little early, So we got a quick look around, but Oh, so you saw it already? No, no, no, no. Yes. We saw this, yes. No, it wasn't like a look around. We really just had a peek. Quick peek. Didn't focus on anything in particular. It's lovely. Got to take this. Sorry. - Do it. - Okay. Hi, this is jerry. Okay, you've got to pull it together. We should just go. He's really uncomfortable. He's uncomfortable because you're acting weird. So you have to stop acting weird. What if we just bring it up? We just put it out in the open? That's the weirdest possible solution to the problem. Sorry about that. Right this way. All right. I have come here today To talk to Mr. David wallace About this whole thing going on with sabre. He will know exactly what to do. He is not a big fan of me dropping by unannounced. But then again who is? - Hey. Hi. Sorry. - Michael. I hope you're not busy doing something. No, you kidding? Come on in. Come on. - You sure? - You look great. You look great too. You hungry? I'm just having lunch. Oh, yeah, that sounds good. Fantastic, Teddy. Look who just stopped in. Keep it up, son. Really loud. Oh, yummy. You have got the life, my friend. Yeah. Can I just stay here and never go back? Things not going so well there? Oh, man. How much time do you have? I have a doctor's appointment Next Thursday. Yeah. Hey, honey. How's your day going? Did you do anything cool? Uh, no, sweetie. I just sort of hung out. Oh, 'cause I saw you had shoes on, So I didn't know if you did anything. No. Just hanging out, honey. You remember Michael. Hi. Sorry, I was just in the neighborhood, And thought I'd come by, see No problem at all. This is great. So what are you guys up to? I don't know. Uh, but maybe, uh Actually, you know, I think maybe we'll go outside. Maybe we'll go outside. Outside. There was one thing we were curious about, Uh, your flexibility on things like easter or memorial day, Because we might want To change our days around a little bit. That seems a bit premature, don't you think? I don't even know if I have a space for you yet, And you're already lining up your holiday plans. Oh, no, sorry. Just, um, we're kind of planners. But we're also flexible too, So you know what? Maybe we can just discuss it when the time comes. Yeah. If the time comes, we can discuss it. Is this because Jim walked in on you going to the bathroom? What? Seriously? You told her? Did it? I it might have come up While we were waiting for you. And you you thought that might have something to do - With how the meeting is going? - No, I didn't Maybe, because it doesn't seem to be going super well. Well, you didn't consider the fact That it might not be going super well Just because it might not be going super well? Nope. 'cause we're really nice people, But you don't seem to like us. I'm being perfectly pleasant. Did you ever consider that you might not be As charming as you think you are? Oh, this coming from the guy Who still uses a children's toilet? Why didn't you just lock the door, man? It doesn't lock for the children's safety. Anybody could have walked in. It was story time. Sabre is changing everything. Site blockers. They don't let us use cups. So I started thinking, who could handle this? Who would know what to do? David wallace would know what to do. What should I do, david wallace? I don't know. I mean, what can you do? Mm. Exactly. What are you thinking? I that's a tough one. It is a tough one. I don't have any ideas for you there. Yeah. But one would be good. Hey, oh, okay. Wait. Okay. I want to tell you about a business idea I have. - Okay. - 'kay? You know how kids leave their toys everywhere? Okay? So this is a vacuum. It's like a shop-vac type of thing. Teaches kids how to pick up their own toys. Right? Baseball gloves. Uh, hacky sacks. Drumsticks. Picks it up. So the kid's making the noise To pick it up? No. No, no, no. That's the that's the vacuum noise. Oh, okay. You you don't like it. No, I think it's No, no, it's okay. Another guy from dunder mifflin, Arnie from research, He's gonna draw up the prototype. And, uh It's like a shop-vac. Did I say that? Yep. It'll be okay. Hey, any fun weekend plans? No. You? Uh, no, actually. So nothing? No movies or parties, Or anything you might want to invite someone to? Nothing. It's wide open. Okay. That's as hard as I can hint. Hey, you know, if you want, I'm sure I could get arnie on board If you wanted to join us for suck it. Work together again. The what? Suck it. That's what it's called. Oh, okay. Huh? Catchy. Kids'll love it. Like it. There are very few things that would make me Not want to team up with david wallace. D suck it is one of 'em. See you later. Oh, Michael! Bye now. Thank you for coming. Thanks for having me. Well, that's not the david wallace That I remember. That is some sort of weird creature That lives in david wallace's house. Oh, my God! All right. Just get me out of here. Hello. Is anybody home? Oh, thank you, Erin. Now, if everyone would please ready their canteens, So I can fill them With the sweet, sweet nectar of gabe's homeland, And then propose a toast. Here we go. You know when people say getting fired Was the best thing that ever happened to them? I feel sorry for those people. That's the best thing? Really? Well, I'm not really one for making speeches. Yes. Yes, you are. You make a lot. But I feel pretty good right now. I really do. A lot better than I did earlier. Let me tell you. That's your toast? No. This is my toast. I think this whole thing with sabre is gonna work out. I have a very good feeling about it. Michael, this isn't a toast. You're just thinking out loud. Here's my toast. Orange juice Is in here. And, like sabre, It is from florida, And it is good. Just 'cause you have liquid, That doesn't make it a toast. Here's the toast. I'm gonna do it now. Raise your container To us and to sabre. To us and to sabre. That is metallicy. Ugh. That's like drinking a battery. Ah. Really gets you in the fillings, doesn't it? Okay, anyway, welcome.
