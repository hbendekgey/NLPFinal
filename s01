All right, Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. - How are things at the library? - I told you. I couldn't close it. So you've come to the master for guidance? Is this what you're saying, grasshopper? Actually, you called me in here, but, yeah. All right. Well, let me show you how it's done. I'd like to speak to your office manager, please. Yes, hello. This is Michael Scott. I am the Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products. Just wanted to talk to you manager-a-manager. All right. Done deal. Thank you very much, sir. You're a gentleman and a scholar. Oh, I'm sorry. OK. I'm sorry. My mistake. That was a woman I was talking to, so She had a very low voice. Probably a smoker, so So that's the way it's done. I've, er, I've been at Dunder Mifflin for 12 years, the last four as Regional Manager. If you want to come through here We have the entire floor. So this is my kingdom, as far as the eye can see. This is our receptionist, Pam. Pam! Pam-Pam! Pam Beasley. Pam has been with us for forever. Right, Pam? Well, I don't know. If you think she's cute now, you should have seen her a few years ago. - What? - Any messages? Er, yeah. Just a fax. Oh! Pam, this is from Corporate. How many times have I told you? There's a special filing cabinet. - You haven't told me. - It's called the wastepaper basket! Look at that. Look at that face. People say I am the best boss. They go, "We've never worked in a place like this. You're hilarious. "And you get the best out of us. " I think that pretty much sums it up. I found it at Spencer Gifts. Shall I play for you? Pa rum pum pum pum I have no gifts for you Pa rum pum pum pum My job is to speak to clients on the phone about er, quantities and type of copier paper. You know, whether we can supply it to them. Whether they can pay for it. And I'm boring myself just talking about this. - Whassup! - Whassup! I still love that after seven years. - Whassup! - Whassup! Whass up! Whassup. What? - Nothing. - OK. All right. - See you later. - All right. - Take care. - Back to work. Just before lunch. That would be great. Corporate doesn't interfere with me. Jan Levitson Gould. Jan, hello. I call her Hillary Rodham Clinton. Right? Not to her face, because Well, not because I'm scared of her. Cos I'm not. But, um Yeah. Was there anything you wanted to add to the agenda? Umm Me no get an agenda. - What? I'm sorry? - I didn't get any agenda. I faxed one to you this morning. Really? I didn't Did we get a fax this morning? Uh, yeah, the one Why isn't it in my hand? A company runs on efficiency of communication, right? So what's the problem, Pam? Why didn't I get it? You put it in the garbage can that was the special filing cabinet. Yeah, that was a joke. That was a joke that was actually my brother's, and It was for bills. It doesn't work with faxes. - Do you want to look at mine? - Lovely. Thank you. OK. Since the last meeting, Ellen and the board decided we can't justify a Scranton branch and a Stamford branch. - OK. - Don't panic. - No, this is good. This is fine. - Listen. Don't panic. - Alarm bells are ring-ding-ding! - We haven't decided. I've spoken to Josh in Stamford and told him the same. It's up to you to convince me your branch can incorporate the other. But it does mean there'll be downsizing. Me no wanna hear that, Jan. Because downsizing is a bitch. It is a real bitch. And I wouldn't wish that on Josh's men. I certainly wouldn't wish it on my men. Or women, present company excluded. Sorry. Er, is Josh concerned about downsizing himself? Not downsizing himself but downsizing? Question. How long do we have to Todd Packer, terrific rep. Do you mind if I take it? Go ahead. - Packman. - Hey, you big queen. - That's not appropriate. - Is old Godzillary coming in today? - I don't know what you mean. - I've been meaning to ask her. - Does the carpet match the drapes? - Oh, my God! Oh! That's horrifying. Horrible. Horrible person. So do you think we could keep a lid on this for now? - I don't want to worry people. - Absolutely. Under this regime, it will not leave this office. Like that. - So what does downsizing actually mean? - Well you guys better update your résumés like I'm doing. I bet it's gonna be me. Probably gonna be me. Yeah, it'll be you. I have an important question for you. Are you going to Angela's cat party on Sunday? Stop. That is ridiculous. Am I going to tell them? No. I don't see the point. As a doctor, you would not tell a patient if they had cancer. - Hey. - Hey. - This is Mr. Scott. - Guilty as charged! Ryan Howard from the temp agency. Daniqua sent me to start today. Howard, like Moe Howard. Three Stooges. Watch this. This is Moe. Nyuck-nyuck-nyuck-nyuck-nyuck. Mee! Right here. Three Stooges. High five. Oh, Pam. It's a guy thing, Pam. I'm sort of a student of comedy. Watch this. Here we go. I'm Hitler. Adolf Hitler. I don't think it would be the worst thing if they let me go because then I might I don't think it's many little girls' dream to be a receptionist. I like to do illustrations. Erm Mostly watercolor. A few oil pencil. Erm, Jim thinks they're good. Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam. Sure. Mr. Davis, let me call you right back. Something just came up. Two minutes. Thank you. - Dwight, what are you doing? - What? - Clearing my desk. - It's not on your desk. It's overlapping. It's spilling over the edge. One word, two syllables. Demarcation. - You can't do that. - Why not? Safety violation. I could fall and pierce an organ. We'll see. This is why the whole downsizing thing doesn't bother me. Downsizing? I have no problem with that. I have been recommending downsizing since I first got here. I even brought it up in my interview. I say, bring it on. You have messages from yesterday. Relax. Everything's under control. Er, Yeah. Yeah. That's important. Right. This is so important, I should run to answer it. - What? - Come on. Six Million Dollar Man. Steve Austin. Actually, that would be a good salary for me, don't you think? Six million dollars? Memo to Jan. I deserve a raise. - Don't we all? - I'm sorry? Nothing. If you're unhappy with your compensation, take it up with HR. Not today, OK? Pam, just be professional. I think I'm a role model. I think I garner people's respect. Attention all employees. We have a meeting in the conference room, ASAP. The people I respect, heroes of mine, would be Bob Hope Abraham Lincoln, definitely. Bono. And probably God would be the fourth one. And I just think all those people really helped the world in so many ways that it's really beyond words. It's really incalculable. I want to set the record straight. I'm Assistant Regional Manager. I should know first. - Assistant to the Regional Manager. - Can you tell me? Tell me quietly. Whisper in my ear. - I'm about to. - Can you tell us? - Please, OK? Do you want me to tell 'em? - You don't know what it is. You tell 'em. With my permission. Go ahead. Corporate has deemed it appropriate to enforce an ultimatum upon me. And Jan is thinking about downsizing either the Stamford branch or this branch. I heard they might be closing this branch down. That's just the rumor going around. This is my first day. I don't really know. - What if they downsize here? - Not gonna happen. - It'll be out of your hands. - It won't be, Stanley. I promise you that. - Can you promise that? - On his mother's grave. - What? - Well, yes, it is a promise. Frankly, I'm a little insulted that you have to keep asking about it. We need to know. I know. Hold on. I think Pam wanted to say something. Pam, you had a look that you wanted to ask a question just then. I was in the meeting with Jan. She did say this branch could get the axe. Are you sure about that? Well, maybe you should stick to the ongoing confidentiality agreement of meetings. Pam, information is power. You can't say for sure whether it'll be us or them, can you? No, Stanley. You did not see me in there with her. I said if Corporate wants to come in here and interfere, they're gonna have to go through me. You can mess with Josh's people, but I'm the head of this family and you ain't gonna be messing with my chillun. If I left, what would I do with all this useless information in my head? You know? Tonnage price of manila folders? Er, Pam's favorite flavor of yogurt, which is mixed berry. Jim said mixed berries? Well, yeah, he's on to me. Watch out for this guy. Dwight Shrute in the building. - This is Ryan, the new temp. - Introduce yourself. Be polite. Dwight Shrute, Assistant Regional Manager. Assistant to the Regional Manager. So, tell him about the kung fu and the car and everything. Er I've got a '78280Z. Bought it for - His profit. - New engine, suspension, respray. I've got some photos. Damn it! Jim! OK. Hold on. The judge is in session. What is the problem? He put my stuff in Jell-O again. Real professional. The third time. It wasn't funny the first two. It's OK here, but people sometimes take advantage because it's so relaxed. I'm a volunteer Sheriff's Deputy on the weekends. And you cannot screw around there. That's sort of one of the rules. - What is that? - That is my stapler. No. Do not take it out. Eat it out, because there are starving people in the world which I hate, and it is a waste of that kind of food. You can be a witness. Can you reprimand him? - How do you know it was me? - It's always you. - Are you going to discipline him? - Discipline. Kinky! Here's the deal, you guys. The thing about a practical joke is you have to know when to start as well as when to stop. And, yeah, Jim. Now is the time to stop putting Dwight's personal effects into Jell-O. OK. Dwight, I'm sorry, because I have always been your biggest flan. Nice. That's the way it is around here. - It goes round and round. - You should put him in custardy. Hey! Yes! New guy! He scores. That's great. I guess what I'm most concerned with is damage to company property. That's all. Pudding. Pudding I'm trying to think of another dessert to do. Do you like going out at the end of the week for a drink? - Yeah. - That's why we're all going out. For an end-of-the-week drink. - When are we going out? - Tonight, hopefully. - Hey, man. - What's going on? Hi, baby. Roy's my fiancé. We've been engaged about three years. We were supposed to get married in September but I think we're gonna get married in the spring. Do you mind if I go out for a drink with these guys? No. Come on. Let's get out of here and go home. OK. I'm gonna be a few minutes. It's only twenty past five. I still have to do my faxes. You know what? You should come with us. It could be a good chance to see what people are like outside the office. - I think it could be fun. - It sounds good. Seriously, we gotta get going. Yeah, yeah. Um What's in the bag? - Tell her I'll talk to her later. - Definitely. All right, dude. Will do. Do I think I'll be invited to the wedding? So have you felt the vibe yet? We work hard, we play hard. Sometimes we play hard when we should be working hard. I guess the atmosphere that I've created here is that I'm a friend first, a boss second and probably an entertainer third. Just a second. Right? Oh, do you like The Jamie Kennedy Experiment? Punk'd and all that kind of stuff? You are gonna be my accomplice. Just go along with it, OK? Just follow my lead. Don't pip me, all right? Come in. - Corporate just said - You got a fax. Thank you. Can you come in here for a sec? I was gonna call you in anyway. You know Ryan. As you know, there is going to be downsizing. And you have made my life so much easier in that I am going to have to let you go first. - What? Why? - Why? Well, theft and stealing. Stealing? What am I supposed to have stolen? Post-it Notes. Post-it Notes? What are those worth, 50 cents? If you steal a thousand Post-it Notes at 50 cents a piece, you know, you've made a profit margin. You're gonna run us out of business, Pam. Are you serious? - Yeah. I am. - I can't believe this. I have never even stolen as much as a paperclip and you're firing me. The best thing about it is we're not going to have to give you any severance pay. Because that is gross misconduct and Just clean out your desk. I'm sorry. You been X'd, punk! Surprise! It's a joke. We were joking around. See? OK. He was in on it. He was my accomplice. It was kind of a morale booster thing. We were showing the new guy around, giving him the feel of the place. So you God, we totally got you. You're a jerk. I don't know about that. What is the most important thing for a company? Is it the cash flow? Is it the inventory? Nuh-uh. It's the people. The people. My proudest moment here was not when I increased profits by 17% or when I cut expenses without losing a single employee. No, no, no, no, no. It was a young Guatemalan guy. First job in the country, barely spoke English. He came to me, and said, "Mr. Scott, would you be the godfather of my child?" Wow. Wow. Didn't work out. We had to let him go. He sucked. - Hey. - Hey. How are you? I thought you were going for a drink with No. I just decided not to. - How's your headache? - It's better, thanks. - Good. That's great. - Is? - Yeah? - Um Are you - Am I walking out? - Yes. - Yes, I Do you want to - Yeah. Great. Let me just Oh, boy. - Listen, have a nice weekend. - Definitely. You too. Enjoy it. You know what, just come here. Hiya. Can I help you out here? - I'm all set, thanks. - Gotcha. Good. I'd go with the rose. That's a good idea. Today is diversity day and someone's going to come in and talk to us about diversity. It's something that I've been pushing, that I've been wanting to push, for a long time and Corporate mandated it. And I never actually talked to Corporate about it. They kind of beat me to the punch, the bastards. But I was going to. I think it's important that we have this. I'm very, very excited. That's the thing. It's very sturdy paper and on the back it says, "100% post-consumer content. " What? Hello? Uh-huh. Wait. What? I'm sorry, Mr. Decker. I think I'm losing you. Hello? Hello? Yeah. Hold on one second. I don't know. Hold on one second. - Do you really have to do that right now? - Yes. I should have done it weeks ago. Mr. Decker, I'm sorry about that. What were you Can you hold on one second? Yeah, just one second. Thanks. Hello? That's it. Perfect. So what I was saying Hello? - Thanks, Dwight. - Retaliation. Dit fortit. That is not the expression. Well, it should be. This is my biggest sale of the year. They love me over there for some reason. I'm not really sure why but I make one call over there every year, just to renew their account, and that one call ends up being 25% of my commission for the whole year, so I buy a mini bottle of champagne, celebrate a little. And this year I'm pushing recycled paper on them for one percent more. I know. I'm getting cocky. Right. Solitaire? Yeah, afraid so. - Six on seven. - I know. I saw that. So then, why didn't you do it? I'm saving that cos I like it when the cards go T- ts-ts-tch-tch-tch. Who doesn't love that? Hey, Oscar! How are you doing, man? - All right. - Did you have a good weekend going there? - It was fine. - I bet it was fun. Oh, hey! This is Oscar. - Martinez. - Right. See? First-name basis. Great. We're all set. Well, diversity, everybody, let's do it. Oscar works in here. Jim, could you wrap it up, please? Mr. Decker, please. It's diversity day, Jim. I wish every day was diversity day. You know what? I'm actually going to have to call you back. Thank you. Sorry about that. - Thank you. - Get 'em in. Get in the cards! Thank you. Thank you very much. OK. Thanks for filling these out and I promise this'll be quick. At Diversity Today, our philosophy is about honesty and positive expectations. We believe that 99% of the problems in the workplace arise simply out of ignorance. You know what? This is a color-free zone here. Stanley, I don't look at you as another race. Er, this is what I'm talking about. We don't have to pretend we're color-blind. - That's fighting ignorance with ignorance. - With tolerance. No. With more ignorance. Right. Exactly. - Instead, we need to celebrate our diversity. - Let's celebrate. Celebrate good times. Come on! Let's celebrate diversity. Yes, exactly. Now, here's what we're going to do. I've noticed that You know what? Here's what we're going to do. Why don't we go around and everybody everybody say a race that you are attracted to sexually. I will go last. Go. I have two. White and Indian. Actually, I'd prefer not to start that way. I would love to have your permission to run this session. Can I have your permission? - Yes. - Thank you very much. - It would also help if you were seated. - OK. Thank you. OK. Now, at the start of the session, I had you write down an incident that you found offensive in the workplace. I'm going to choose one and we'll act it out. The ground rules? - Run it by me and I'll run it by him. OK. Can we steer away from gay people? - Um - I'm sorry. It's an orientation. It's not a race. Plus a lot of other races are also intolerant of gays, so paradox. Well, we only have an hour. - I figured it would save time. - Why don't we just defer to Mr - Mr. Brown. - Ah. Oh, right! OK. First test. I will not call you that. It's my name. It's not a test. OK? Um, looking through the cards, I noticed many of you wrote down the same incident, which is ironic, because it's the exact incident I was brought in here to respond to. Now, how many of you are familiar with the Chris Rock routine? Very good. OK. How come Chris Rock can do a routine and everybody finds it hilarious and ground-breaking and then I go and do the exact same routine, same comedic timing, and people file a complaint to Corporate? Is it because I'm white and Chris is black? We'll reenact this with a more positive outcome. I will play the Chris Rock guy. I would like to see someone else pull this off. Let's have someone not involved in the reenactment. OK, I will play guy listening. Great. Guy listening. OK, anyone else remember? I remember. You're the Chris Rock guy and you're guy listening. Kevin is a great guy. He's a great accountant. He is not much of an entertainer. Basically, there are two types of black people and black people are actually more racist because they hate the other type of black people. Every time the one type wants to have a good time, then the other type comes in and makes a real mess. OK. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. He's ruin He's butchering it. Could you just let me Every time Every time black people want to have a good time, some idiot ass - I take care of my kid! - Wait a second. They always want credit for something they supposed to do! Stop it! You want a cookie? Now, this is a simple acronym. HERO. At Diversity Today, we believe it is very easy to be a HERO. All you need are honesty, empathy, respect and open-mindedness. Excuse me, but that's not all it takes to be a hero. Great. Well, what is a hero to you? A hero kills people, people that wish him harm. A hero is part-human and part-supernatural. A hero is born out of a childhood trauma, or out of a disaster that must be avenged. OK, you're thinking of a superhero. We all have a hero in our heart. Now, I need you to take these forms. This expresses the joint experience we had today. I want you to look 'em over and sign them as kind of a group pledge. - I don't think I can sign this. - I can't leave until you do. Well, OK. It says here that I learned something and I knew all this stuff already, so I could sign something that says that I taught something, that I helped you teach something, so Pam! Where is she? - Pam, could we change something on this? - Michael, can I talk to you candidly? Sure. We both know that I'm here because of the comments that you made. Here's the thing. This office, I think is very advanced in terms of racial awareness and it's probably more advanced than you're used to. - That's probably thrown you off a little. - It's not. I need your signature. I know. You told me that several times. - But you're not listening. I need a signature. - OK. My instructions from the Corporate offices are to put you through this seminar for the comments you made. The reason I made copies for everyone was so you wouldn't be embarrassed. Well, here I am thinking that you actually cared about diversity training. - And you don't. - Don't worry about dating it. I won't. OK, thank you. "I regret my actions. I regret offending my coworkers. "I pledge to bring my best spirit of honesty, empathy, respect and open-mindedness " Open-mindedness, is that even a word? " into the workplace. In this way, I can truly be a hero. "Signed, Daffy Duck. " He's going to lose it when he reads that. Yeah, hi. Is Mr. Decker around? Well, could you have him call me after lunch? Thank you. "I pledge to always keep an open mind "and an open heart. " I do believe in that part of the pledge that I just read. But a pledge, come on. Who are we, the Girl Scouts? No. Look the guy, Mr. Brown he got us halfway there. He got us talking. Well, no. I got us talking. He got us nothing. He insulted us and he abandoned us. You call that diversity training? I don't. Were there any connections between us? Did anyone look each other in the eye? Was there any emotion going on? No. Where was the heart? I didn't see any heart. Where was my Oprah moment? OK, get as much done as you can before lunch because, afterward, I'm going to have you all in tears. All right? Everybody pretty? Come on. Here we go. It's time. Let's do some good. We're not all going to sit in a circle Indian style, are we? Get out. - I'm sorry. - No, this is not a joke. OK? That was offensive and lame. So double offensive. This is an environment of welcoming and you should just get the hell out of here. OK, let's go. Let's do it. Come on. Let's have some fun, everybody. Here we go. Take a seat. Cop a squat. And um thank you for coming in. Um Diversity is the cornerstone of progress, as I've always said. But don't take my word for it. Let's take a look at the tape. Hi. I'm Michael Scott. I'm in charge of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products here in Scranton, Pennsylvania but I'm also the founder of Diversity Tomorrow, because today is almost over. Abraham Lincoln once said that, "If you're a racist, I will attack you with the North. " And those are the principles that I carry with me in the workplace. OK. Questions? Comments? Anybody? Jim? Uh, is that it? Yes. I only had an hour to put it together but I'm going to add on to it later on. It was kind of hard to hear. Yes. That probably had something to do with the camera work. Anybody else? Um I have a customer meeting. Well, if you leave, we'll only have two left. Yes. Enjoy. Absolutely. Namaste. OK, well, since I am leading this, let's get down to business and why don't I just kind of introduce myself, OK? Um. I am Michael and I am part English, Irish, German and Scottish. Sort of a virtual United Nations. But what some of you might not know is that I am also part Native American Indian. - What part Native American? - Two fifteenths. That fraction doesn't make any sense. Well, you know what, it's kind of hard for me to talk about. The suffering. So who else? Let's get this popping. Come on. Who's going? Let's go here. Oscar, right here. You're on. OK, Michael, um Both my parents were born in Mexico. Oh, yeah And they moved to the United States a year before I was born. - So I grew up in the United States. - Wow. My parents were Mexican. Wow. That is That is a great story. - That's the American dream, right? - Thank Yeah. Um, let me ask you, is there a term besides Mexican that you prefer? - Something less offensive? - Mexican isn't offensive. - Well, it has certain connotations. - Like what? Like I don't I don't know. What connotations, Michael? You meant something. - Now, remember that honesty - I'm just curious. empathy, respect Jim! Jim! Hello? Hello? I have something here. I want you to take a card. Put it on your fore Don't look at the card. I want you to take the card and put it on your forehead and Take a card, any card. Um And I want you to treat other people like the race that is on their forehead, OK? So everybody has a different race. Nobody knows what their race is, so I want you to really go for it, cos this is real. This isn't just an exercise. This is real life. And I have a dream that you will really let the sparks fly. Get her done. Why? Because Martin Luther King is a hero of mine. There's this great Chris Rock bit about how streets named after Martin Luther King tend to be more violent. I'm not going to do it but it's Oh, this is a good one. - Um, hi. How are you? - Fine. How are you? Great. - Push it. I admire your culture's success in America. - Thank you. - Good. Bom bom bom-bom bom. Come on. Olympics of Suffering right here. Slavery versus the Holocaust. Come on. - Who am I supposed to be? - No, that was inadvertent. We didn't actually plan that. "Lots of cultures eat rice" doesn't help me. Um Shalom. I'd like to apply for a loan. - That's nice, Dwight. - OK, do me. Something stereotypical so I can get it quick. - I like your food. - Outback steakhouse. I'm Australian, mate. - Pam, come on. "I like your food. " Come on. Stir the pot. Stir the melting pot, Pam! - Let's do it. Let's get ugly. Let's get real. - OK. If I have to do this, based on stereotypes that are totally untrue, that I do not agree with, you would maybe not be a very good driver. Oh, man, am I a woman? You'll notice I didn't have anybody be an Arab. I thought that would be too explosive. No pun intended. But I just thought, "Too soon for Arabs. " Maybe next year. Um You know, the ball's in their court. - What you watching? - Chappelle's Show. - Really? - I downloaded it on her computer. - I hope she doesn't mind. - No way. I think she likes this stuff. She's cute, huh? Yeah, you know, she's engaged, but Oh, no, the girl in the - sketch. - Oh, yeah. She's hot. - Hey. - Hey. You wanna go to the beach? Sure. - You want to get high? - No. - I think you do, mon. - Stop OK. All right. No. It's good. You just need to push it. You need to go a little bit further. All right. OK. Kelly, how are you? - I just had the longest meeting. - Oh! Welcome to my convenience store. Would you like some googi googi? I have some very delicious googi googi, only 99 cents plus tax. Try my googi googi. Try my googi googi. Try my googi googi. Try my All right! All right! Yes! That was great. She gets it! Now she knows what it's like to be a minority. Mr. Decker, we didn't lose your sale today, did we? Excellent. OK. Let me just get your What's that? No, we didn't close last time. I just need your Oh. W- What code were you given? Oh, OK. That's actually another salesman here. I can redo it if you want to do that. He gave you a discount? No, I don't blame you. I just hated it when that guy was in here. Mr. Brown, if that was his real name. I mean, he had never met any of us before and here he was telling us how to do our thing. I just wanted I just wanted to do it our way. You know? On our own. Man, I should have gotten some food. Maybe some spagh-etti. - OK, Kevin, you can take that off. That would really, really have shown him up, wouldn't it? If I'd brought in some burritos or some colored greens, or some pad Thai. I love pad Thai. - It's collard greens. - What? - It's collard greens. - That doesn't really make sense. You don't call them collared people. That's offensive. Hmmm OK. Well, it's after five. So Thank you very much. Buena vista, Oscar. Thank you. Good job. Oh, my man. Thank you, Brazil. Nice. Um Hey. Hey. - We can go. - Sorry. That's fine. Uh Not a bad day. Pam. Pamela. Pam-elama-ding-dong. - Making copies. - I'm not making any copies. Let's go. Messages. Stat. Lots to do, lots to do. Information superhighway. - Nothing new. - Lay them on moi. What? - There's nothing new. - That's not what you said earlier. Do you want me to repeat the messages that I gave you before for the The most sacred thing I do is care and provide for my workers, my family. I give them money. I give them food. Not directly, but through the money. I heal them. Today, I am in charge of picking a great new health care plan. Right? That's what this is all about. Does that make me their doctor? Um Yes, in a way. Yeah. Like a specialist. So, which health plan have you decided on? I am going to go with the best, Jan. I am going to go with the one with the acupuncture, therapeutic massage, the works. None of the plans have acupuncture. Have you looked at them closely? I think it was you who didn't look closely enough at the Gold Plan. The Gold Plan? I'm not even on that plan. - Well, I'd recommend it. It's very good. - Michael. - You gotta crack these things open. - We're doing this to save money. So you just need to pick a provider and choose the cheapest plan. Well, that is kind of a tough assignment. - Um It won't be popular around the orifice. - It's your job. Well, it's a suicide mission, you know. - Michael Maybe I mean - There there Sometimes a manager like yourself has to deliver the bad new to the employees. - I do it all the time. - When have you ever done that? I'm doing it right now. To you. Last night on Trading Spouses Have you seen it? - No. I have a life. - Interesting. What's that like? - You should try it sometime. - Wow. But then who would watch my TV? That is - Your problem. - Jimbo! Ha-ha-ha! There's a decision that needs to be made, and I'm having a busy day. So I'm going to let you pick a health care plan for our office and then explain it to your co-workers. - Gosh. - Yeah! That is a great offer. Thank you. I really think I should be concentrating on sales. - Really? - Yeah. I just don't think this is the kind of task that I am going to do. You know who would be great for this? Any time Michael asks me to do anything, I just tell him that Dwight should do it. Yes. I can do it. I'm your man. Right now, this is just a job. If I advance any higher in this company, then this would be my career. And, er Well, if this were my career, I'd have to throw myself in front of a train. OK. First, let's go over some parameters. How many people can I fire? - None. You're picking a health care plan. - We'll table that for now. Two, I'll need an office. The conference room should be fine. You can use the conference room as a temporary workspace. Yes. I have an office. Bigger than his. - No, you cannot use it. - OK, it's a workspace. Temporary workspace. You can use it. Thank you. If Dwight fails, then that is strike two, and good for me for giving him a second chance. And if he succeeds, then no one will be prouder than I am. I groomed him. I made him what he is today. Unless he fails, and we've talked about that already. What did I do? I did my job. I slashed benefits to the bone. I saved this company money. Was I too harsh? Maybe. I don't believe in coddling people. In the wild, there is no health care. In the wild, health care is, "Ow, I hurt my leg. I can't run. "A lion eats me and I'm dead. " Well, I'm not dead. I'm the lion. You're dead. There's no dental, there's no vision, there's a $1,200 deductible. - Dundler Mifflin. This is Pam. - Pam, Michael Scott. How's tricks? Where are you? Oh, I am in my office. I am swamped. I have work up to my ears. I'm busy, busy, busy. Can't step away. I just wanted to check in and see how everybody's doing. - Everybody cool out there? - Actually, people are really unhappy. Dwight sent around this memo and people are freaking out Pam! Whoa! I'm sorry. I gotta go. I'm getting a call. No, you're not. I have to make a call after I finish my work. You know what? Just don't let anybody in my office under any conditions. I'm just too busy. Too swamped, you know? I am unreachable. I am incommunicado, capisce? - OK. - Thank you. Oh, here we go again. - Gotta go. I have to take this. - Still no one calling. - Dwight, what - Knock, please. - Please knock. This is an office. - It says "workspace". - Same thing. - Then why did you write "workspace"? Just knock. Please? As a sign of respect for your superior. - You are not my superior. - Then why do I have an office? - I thought it was a workspace. - OK. Dwight. Are you really in charge of health care? - Yes. And my decision is final. - This is a ridiculously awful plan. - You cut everything. - Times are tough, Pam. Deal with it. - Did you cut more than you had to? - Sure. Why? You work here. Don't you want good insurance? Don't need it. Never been sick. Perfect immune system. If you've never been sick, then you don't have any antibodies. I don't need them. Superior genes. I'm a Schrute. And superior brainpower. Through concentration, I can raise and lower my cholesterol at will. - Why would you raise your cholesterol? - So I can lower it. He literally won't come out of his office. He's gotta come out sometime. - To go to the bathroom! - Kevin. That's inappropriate. - Michael, can I talk to you? - I would love to but I'm busy. Rain check? Michael. Michael, please. Can we talk to you about this memo? What? Which memo? Dwight's health care memo. - Is it a good plan? - It's a great plan. - It saves the company a fortune. - It's a pay decrease. - Michael, he made huge cuts. - Cuts? What? - Dwight, did you make cuts? - Yeah, you said No! You know what? I said nothing specific because I was so busy. Why don't you go in there and find these people a plan that will work for them? - I can handle that. - OK? All right. Do we feel good? All right. Good. Plus, there's some other good news. Today, at the end of the day, I will have, for all of you, a big surprise. OK? So hang in there, and I will see you at the end of the day. Right? - This is not good. - It's ridiculous. - Did you talk to him? - What was that? You let him walk all over you. It's just pathetic. - What are you guys talking about? - Nothing, Kevin. Do I know what the surprise is? Hell, no! It doesn't matter. They're not unhappy anymore. They're out there thinking, "Wow, my boss really cares about me. "He has a surprise. He's cool. "What a great guy. I love him. "I love him. " OK, everyone. Gather round. Step forward. I believe that some of you are unhappy with my plan. So what I'd like you to do is to fill this out and write down any diseases you have that you might want covered and I'll see what I can do. We can't write our diseases down for you because that's confidential. I didn't say to write your name down, did I? Fill it out, leave it anonymous. Or don't write any disease down at all and it won't be covered. Fair? Good. - I'll be in my office. - Workspace. You know what? Come with me. We are going on a little mission. Operation Surprise. - Where are you going? - Um Headed out. Part of my busy day, you know. Meetings. Couldn't find the knob. So, basically, I want to do something nice for my employees. Atlantic City, OK? They have this thing where they send a bus, right, for free, picks everybody up, you head down there, get to the hotel, the room is comped, they give you a pile of chips, and your food, everything just kind of all-inclusive, free kind of weekend. I don't know of anything like that, but you might want to call those casinos directly. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I did. So. Wait. What are you writing? Don't write Ebola or mad cow disease. Right? Cos I'm suffering from both. - I'm inventing new diseases. - Oh, great. Let's say my teeth turn to liquid and they drip down the back of my throat. - What would you call that? - I thought you were inventing diseases. That's spontaneous dental hydroplosion. - Nice. - Thank you. Calling you ask you a little favoroonie. Trying to give the troops around here a little bit of a boost. I was thinking that maybe we could take them down to take a spin on your big ride. You mean the elevator that takes you down into the mine shaft? It's not really a ride. It says here that it's a 300ft drop. It goes 300 feet into the earth but it moves really slowly. - So it's not a free fall. - It's an industrial coal elevator. Uh All right. Well, once you get down into the mine, what Have you got Laser Tag or something? OK, so I don't know what the surprise is. Am I worried? No. No way. See, I thrive on this. This is my world. This is improv. This is Whose Line Is It Anyway? Who did this? I'm not mad. I just want to know who did it so I can punish them. - What are you talking about? - Someone forged medical information. - That is a felony. - Whoa. That's a pretty intense accusation. - How do you know that they're fake? - Uh, leprosy? "Flesh-eating bacteria. "Hot-dog fingers. "Government-created killer nanorobot infection. " - You did this, didn't you? - No. I know it was you. Fine. I'll have to interview each and every one of you until the perpetrator makes him or herself known. And until that time, there will be no health care coverage for anyone. - Killer nanorobots? - It's an epidemic. The problem, Jim, is that people who are really suffering from a medical condition won't receive the care they need, because someone in this office is coming up with all this ridiculous stuff. - "Count Choculitis. " - Sounds tough. Why did you write that down, Jim? Is it because you know I love Count Chocula? - Do you? - I think you need to confess the fact - Yeah. - What are you doing? Those are my keys. - Good luck. - Jim! Damn it! No! Jim! Let me out! Jim! Let The light green - Jim Halpert. - Let me out. - Who is this? - You're fired. - You can't fire me. - I can. I'm manager for the day. - Clean out your desk. - Can you hold on? I'm getting the, er beep. - Jim Halpert. - Hey, Jim. It's Pam. Hey, Pam. How are you? - Good. How are you? - I'm doing OK. Getting excited for the weekend. What are you up to? - I'm not bothering you, am I? - Not at all. - You're not doing anything? - I have nothing to do. Jim! This weekend? Nothing. I'm not really doing anything. I might go to the mall. I need new shoes. Oh, interesting. What kind of shoes? - Hello? - Hello. This is Dwight Schrute calling for Jan Levenson-Gould. - This is Jan. - Hi. Dwight Schrute, Acting Manager, Scranton branch. I needed your permission to fire Jim Halpert. - Who is this? - Dwight Schrute. From sales? Where's Michael Scott? He is not here right now. He put me in charge of the office. Dwight, listen carefully. You are not a manager of anything. - Understand? - That's not entirely true. He put me in charge of picking the health care plan. Really? OK. When Michael gets back, tell him to call me immediately. Call you immediately. Good. Oh, listen. Since I have you on the phone, can I fire Jim? No. Please don't use my cellphone ever again. Oh, I thought this was your Hey, everybody. Ice-cream sandwiches! Aaahh! Here you go. Take one, take one. It's all good. Phyllis, think fast. Ya-bome! Oh, I see Angela. Angela? Waaaahhh! Hey, temp. Why don't you take two? Because you don't get health care. And faster metabolism. Did you get the kind with the cookies? Why don't you just eat it, OK? - And here you go, Stanley the manly. - Oh, thanks. This isn't the big surprise, is it? Because we've been having a pretty horrible day. Er Nope. Nope. This isn't the surprise. It's surprising, um because you didn't expect it. But you will You'll know it when you see it. Michael. Michael? Oh, Christ. I tried being rational, OK, and what happened? The employees went crazy. I got no help from Corporate. That leaves me with no options. I'm going to read your submitted conditions. When you hear yours, raise your hand to indicate that it is real. If you do not raise your hand, it will not be covered. - What about confidentiality? - You have forfeited that privilege. I have tried to treat you all as adults but obviously I am the only adult here. Number one. Inverted penis. Could you mean vagina? Because if you do, I want that covered. Your vagina was removed during your hysterectomy. A uterus is different from a vagina. I still have a vagina. OK. Great. Dermatitis. Thank you, Angela. I'll make sure that's covered. OK. Now. Who wrote this hysterical one? - Anal fissures? - That's a real thing. Yeah, but no one here has it. Someone has it. - Do you think we should go? - I don't know. This is important. - What is he doing? - I don't know. Well? Well, what? You could be referring to anything. OK. The health care plan. Why did you put Dwight in charge? He was horrible. Dwight? Did you raise benefits? - I most certainly did not. - Oh, come on. That's horrible. Aah Thanks, Dwight, for a crappy plan. Ah, damn! Oh I wish I had time to change it but Jan needs it by five. What time is it? It's after five. Oh Oh, it's awful! So. Well. OK. See you guys on Monday. What about the surprise? Oh Yes. Exactly. Thank you, Angela, for reminding me. Terrific. Before I tell everybody what the big surprise is, would you like to tell me what you think the big surprise is? - We all think you don't have a surprise. - I have some news for you. There is a big surprise. And here it is. Here we go. And the big surprise is Brrrrrrrr! Drum roll Brrrrrrrr! Brrrrrrrr! When I am backed into a corner, that is when I come alive. See, I learned improv from the greats, like Drew Carey and Ryan Stiles. God, yeah Ah! This Robin Williams. Man, would I love to go head-to-head with him. Oh! That would be exciting. "Hi. I'm Mork from Ork. " Well, I'm Bork from Spork. Nanoo, nanoo. Jibelee, baloobaloo. Oh, um Jan wants you to call her. - Michael? - Oh, God. Dwight, come on - About the downsizing - There is none. But if there were, I'd be protected as assistant regional manager? - Assistant to the regional manager. - So I needn't worry? Look, I talked to Corporate about protecting sales staff. They couldn't guarantee it if we downsize. - But we're not downsizing, so - Bottom line. Do I need to be worried? Mm, mm, mm. Maybe. It looks like there's gonna be downsizing. And it's part of my job, but I hate it. I think the main difference between me and Donald Trump is that I get no pleasure out of saying the words, "You're fired. " You're foir-ed. "Uh, you're foir-ed. " It just makes people sad, and an office can't function that way. "You're foir-ed. " I think if I had a catchphrase, it would be, "You're hired and you can work here as long as you want. " But that's unrealistic, so It's a real shame, cos studies have shown that more information gets passed through water-cooler gossip than memos. Which puts me at a disadvantage, because I bring my own water to work. - Why d'you do this? - I didn't do it. What do you mean? Oh, the water cooler was brought over here for maintenance. So what do you guys hear? What's a scuttlebutt? Get set for Operation Morale Improvement, starring Michael Scott. I think I have had a little stroke of genius in that I have had my assistant Pam Smile, Pam. I have had her go out and find out whose birthday is coming up so we can have a little celebration for it. Not bad. Not bad at all. All right. And the birthday person is Drum roll, please. Who is the birthday person? - Who is it? Who's the birthday? - Um Actually, we don't have any staff birthdays coming up. Next person on the - calendar. - OK, um - That would be Meredith. - Yes! All right. Come on down, Meredith. - But it's not until next month. - Um Uh, OK. Great, well, you know, it'll be a surprise. - You still wanna have a party? - Yeah, why not? Sure. Go ahead, live a little. Come on, Pam. Come on, shake it up. Shake it up! Shake it up! Brrrp! Uh, Spock, are there any signs of life down there? Well, let me check, Captain. Eeee! Eeee! Eeee! Eeee! No, Captain. No signs of life down here. Just a wet blanket named Pam. Brrr-rrrp. Star Trek Well, for decorations, maybe we could - It's stupid. Forget it. - What? I was going to say maybe we could have streamers, but that's dumb, everybody has streamers. - Never mind. - No, I think that's a good idea. What color do you guys think? Well, there's green blue yellow - red - How about green? - I think green is kind of whoreish. - This was tough. I suggested we flip a coin but Angela said she doesn't like to gamble. Of course, by saying that, she was gambling that I wouldn't smack her. These are my party-planning beeyatches. Pulled off an amazing '80s party last year. Off the hook! So I was thinking, if you haven't already got a cake maybe going for one of those ice-cream cakes from Baskin-Robbins. "Very good. Very delicious. " Meredith's allergic to dairy, so She's not the only one that's gonna be eating it, right? I think everybody likes ice-cream cake. It's not It's not just about her, so - It is her birthday. - Mint chocolate chip! How about mint chocolate chip? Hey, so listen I was thinking that it might be a good idea if you and I formed an alliance because of the downsizing. I think an alliance might be a good idea, you know. Help each other out. Do you want to form an alliance with me? - Absolutely, I do. - Good, good. Excellent. OK. Now we need to figure out who's vulnerable and who's protected At that moment, I was so happy. Everything Dwight does annoys me. Did you get your tickets? - To what? - The gun show. And I spend hours thinking of ways to get back at him but only in ways that would get me arrested. And then here he comes and he says, "Jim, here's a way. " There's one other thing and this is important. Let's keep this alliance totally secret. Don't tell anyone. An alliance? What does that even mean? I think it has something to do with Survivor, but I'm not sure. Um I know that it involves spying on people and we may build a fort. Jim? Hey. Hi, Pam. Listen, could I talk to you a second about the paper products. - Did you tell Pam about the alliance? - What? No? - Just now? - Dwight, no. I'm using her, for the alliance. Who knows the most information about this office? Pam. - That's good. Pursue this. - I'm trying to. See what I'm doing? I'm going to have to talk to her a lot. There may be chatting, and giggling. - You gotta just pretend to ignore it. - Done. All right. Can you get her? She's right there. That is Meredith, the birthday girl. And this is Meredith's card. "Happy Bird-Day!" Um, let's see. Jim Jim wrote, "Meredith, I heard you're turning "Just fudge the numbers. " Not bad. Pretty funny. I don't appreciate condoning corporate fraud though. Here's the thing. Whatever I write here has to be really, really funny because people out there are expecting it. I've already set the bar really high. And they're all worried about their jobs, you know. It's kinda dark out there. Can you imagine if I wrote something like, uh "Oh, Meredith. Happy birthday. "You're great. Love, Michael. " They seem awfully chummy, don't you think? - What do you think that's about? - Only one way to find out. I'm on it. - You are not going to believe this. - I believe it. - Tensions were high. - It was in the body language. - That looks good. What is it? Turkey? - Italian. Oh, Italian. Nice. Wow! You got the works there. Red onion. Provolone Toby and Kevin are trying to get Angela kicked off. Good. Let 'em. It helps our cause. Well, if Kevin's in Accounting and Toby's in Human Resources and they're talking They're forming an alliance. - I love their sandwiches. - I love them too. - Their bread's really good. - It's very good. Damn it. Damn it! God! OK, listen. We need to assume that everyone is forming an alliance to get us kicked off. God damn it! Why us? Because we're strong, Dwight. Because we're strong. Meredith, Meredith Meri Mary had a little lamb. Mary Meredith had a little lamb. Don't bring that lamb to work or it'll poop on the floor. Hey, Oscar! Come on in. What's up? - I'm sorry to bother you. - Not at all. Come on in. My nephew is involved with a charity for cerebral palsy and I was wondering if maybe you'd like to you know - What? - Donate to the charity. Oh, God. Of course I would. Get it over here. - Get that over here. - Thank you. No, I'm always good for some serious buckage. Wow. Two dollars, three dollars. People out here do not care about diseases. I am going to give you $25. That's that's - That's very generous. - Oh, my gosh, well Listen, Oscar, generosity and togetherness and community all convalescences into morale. That's what I say, so - Hey, Jim, can I talk to you for a second? - Sure, what's up? I don't know. I'm going a little crazy cos I keep overhearing all these conversations between Michael and Corporate about, like, staff issues. - Oh, no? - Yeah, he's making me take notes on these meetings and I'm, like, "These people are my friends. " But he's, like, "This is confidential. You can't tell anybody. " I just feel like I want to aah - Promise me you're not gonna say anything. - No, I won't tell anybody. - This is between you and me. - OK. Yeah. - Jackpot. - That was beautiful. All her idea, too. Awesome. She's so great. Meredith, bad breath. Meredith has bad breath. - Hey. You wanted to see me? - Yeah. - What do you know about Meredith? - I don't think she'd be missed. There's not going to be downsizing, Dwight, OK? I just I need to know a little bit more about my friend. Name, Meredith Palmer. Personal information, divorced twice, two kids. Employer, Dunder Mifflin Paper Incorporated. - Awards, multiple Dundees. - I know all that. I need something kind of embarrassing, you know. Kind of fun, inside. She had a hysterectomy. - Which one is that again? - They remove the uterus. Oh, God! Dwight, no. I'm trying to write something funny. What do I do with a removed uterus? - It could be kinda funny. - I am on a deadline here. And just OK. Thanks. Thanks for your help. I'll work it out. Thank you, Dwight. That was a waste of time. OK, here's the deal. All right. Pam says one of the alliances is meeting in the warehouse during Meredith's birthday. - We have to be there. - I know, but there's no place to hide. Yes, there is. Behind the shelves. - Oh, my God. - What? What? - I know. I know exactly what to do. - Great. I'm a deer hunter. I go all the time with my dad. One thing about deer, they have very good vision. One thing about me, I am better at hiding than they are at vision. This is going to be perfect, OK? Centrally located. Perfect cover. - I can hear and see everything. - Good. Michael? Are you done yet? - Just a sec. Just a second. It is perfect. Thank you. Excellent. Here we go. It is time, thank you. OK, come on. Let's go! Get the cake. Here we go. Come on! Shhh. Be quiet. - Wait, this isn't gonna work. The lid's open. - So tape it down. - I can't. You won't be able to breathe. - I can breathe just fine. But if it makes you feel better, I'll poke holes in the box. Thank you. OK. Sur-prise! Oh Surprise! - No It's uh - It's surprise, Meredith! One, two Happy birthday to you - Find a key. - Happy birthday So do you want me to stay here and you know, stand next to the box? No, you need to go upstairs to the party - so people don't notice we're both gone. - Right That's good. Can I trust Jim? I don't know. Do I have a choice? No, frankly, I don't. Will I trust Jim? Yes. Should I trust Jim? You tell me. birthday, dear Meredith Happy birthday to you And many more! Last year, five years ago - Were you surprised? - Yes. You looked freaked, man. We said, "Surprise. " You were, like, "What?" "What the hell's goin' on here?" - Why don't you have some of this cake? - Uh, I can't. - Come on. A little bit. - I can't eat dairy. - Oh, right. Too bad. It's so good. - It makes me sick. You know, if I were allergic to dairy, I think I'd kill myself. Cos this is way, way too good. - He's in a box? - Pam, he's in a box. He's downstairs, in a box, on the floor, near the shelves. I'm serious. Go down there and work your magic. Hey, where are you? Yeah, we were supposed to meet here. What? Oh, my gosh! That ties in perfectly with something that Michael was telling me earlier! I just don't know what some of the people in, like, Accounting are gonna do. It said specifically that Oh. Jim, good party, huh? Just a little something I whipped up - a little morale boost. Speaking of which, I meant to tell you. Very impressive, your donation to Oscar's charity. - What was it, 25 bucks? - Well, you know, money isn't everything. It's not the key to happiness. You know what is? Joy. You should remember that. Maybe you'll give more than three dollars next time. Yeah, well, three dollars a mile is gonna end up being like 50 bucks. So God, I can't even calculate what you're gonna have to give. Is Oscar around? I just thought it was kind of a flat, you know $25, one-time donation. I didn't think it was a per mile kinda deal. You know, so Well, that's what a walkathon is. - I know. - It says it right on the sheet. Look at the sheet. It says, "However many dollars per mile. " Got it. Yes. So it does. Um I just think it's kind of cheap to undonate money to a charity. No, no. That wasn't what I was No. It's not about the money. It's just It It's the ethics of the thing, Oscar. How's your nephew? Is he in good shape? - Yeah. - How many miles did he do last year? - Last year, he walked 18 miles. - Son of a bitch. That is impressive. - Happy birthday. - Read it out. Say who wrote everything so we know whose is the best. "Happy Bird-Day!" Um "Meredith, good news. You're not actually a year older because you work here "where time stands still. " - I don't know about that. - That was Stanley. "Meredith, happy birthday. - "You're the best. Love, Pam. " - Aw! - Huh! Thanks, downer. - This is from Michael. "Meredith, let's hope the only downsizing that happens to you "is that someone downsizes your age. " Because of the downsizing. Rumors. And because you're gettin' old. No, I I get it. - It's funny. - You didn't get the joke. That's cool. You know what? Actually I have a bunch of these, good ones, that I didn't use. Um Oh, where's that? Oh, OK. Here's a good one. "Meredith, Liz Taylor called. She wants her age back and her divorces back. " Cos Meredith's been divorced, like, twice. Is that right? You're right. You're right. Yes. Divorce Um Oh, OK. "Meredith is so old " - How old is she? - If everybody could do it? - "Meredith is so old " - How old is she? "She's so old she went into an antiques store and they kept her. " That wasn't even mine. I got that off the internet. Website. Don't get mad at me. - Nice party, Michael. - This isn't my fault. Ladies, not your best effort. The streamers - I think we could have done better than that. - Phyllis wanted red. I didn't. Oh, boy You OK. We All right. People. Hold on, hold on. Just a second. We're losing sight of what is really important here and that is that we are a group of people who work together. I was I really wasn't gonna flaunt this. I have made a very sizeable donation to Oscar's nephew's walkathon. $25. - Per mile. - Per mile, yes. When I retire, I I don't want to just disappear to an island somewhere. I wanna be the guy who gives everything back. A check for the kids, and for the team. I want it to be, like "Hey, who donated that hospital wing that is saving so many lives?" "Um, well, I don't know. It was anonymous. " "Well, guess what. "That was Michael Scott. " "But it was anonymous. How do you know?" "Because I'm him. " Thank you, Michael. Come here. Don't cash that till Friday, OK? - Really? Today? - Yeah. - Happy birthday. - Thanks. - I could say something. - Don't do that. OK, I have something that totally tops the box. - Oh, tell me, tell me. - OK. I have convinced Dwight he needs to go to Stamford and spy on our other branch. But before he does so, I told him that he should dye his hair to go undercover. That's perfect! If we can get him to drive to Connecticut and put peroxide in his hair - What the hell is this? Trying to cop a feel? - No, dude. No. - Just listen. Whoa. - Come on. God, I don't even know how to explain this. Dwight asked me to be in an alliance. And then we've just been messing with him because of the whole alliance thing. - It's just office pranks. - It's stupid. What the hell's he talking about? I have absolutely no idea. Come on. Do I feel bad about betraying Jim? Not at all. That's the game. Convince him we're in an alliance, get some information, throw him to the wolves. That's politics, baby. Get what you can outta someone, then crush them. I think Jim might have learned a very valuable lesson. Hey. You ready? All right. Secret sign. Hey, Ryan. Very good. Excellent. Excellent. Michael. Today at lunchtime we're going to be playing the warehouse staff at a friendly little game of basketball. My idea. I noticed they'd put up a couple of hoops and I play basketball every weekend so I thought, "This might be kinda fun. " And I started messing around and Im sinking a few, you know. Swish, swish. Nothing but net. And their jaws just dropped to the floor. African-Americans, so You know, it's really just a good friendly game, a reason to get together. Pam, Pam, thank you, ma'am. Messages, please. Michael, can I talk to you, please? Privately? In your office? - I think I should be on the team. - No. That's not me being mean. - That is based on your past behavior. - Please. When I let him come to my pick-up game - I apologized for that. - I vouched for you. I vouched for you in front of Todd Packer, Dwight. All right, here's what I'm gonna do. The hand strikes and gives a flower. You are not going to play basketball. But I need somebody to come in and take over the holiday and weekend work calendar. - I can handle that. - Good. Excellent. It'll be fun. Because Corporate wants somebody to be here on Saturday and so we have to have some people come in on the weekend, and I know everybody's gonna complain and bitch and I don't wanna deal with that. It's why you have an assistant manager. Yes, it is. Assistant to the regional manager. - Same thing. - No, it's not. It's lower, so It's close. So we need someone to work this Saturday and I think that should be - Jim. - God, this is so sad. This is the smallest amount of power I've ever seen go to someone's head. - Phyllis, can you believe this? - Keep me out of it. My fiancé has plans for us this Saturday so I really hope Dwight doesn't make me work. Maybe I should sleep with him? I'm kidding. Kidding. Totally kidding. All right! Managing by walking around! This is our warehouse. Or, as I like to call it, the whorehouse. - Don't you do that. I've earned the right. - Fine, don't worry about that. And here we have "Mister Roger's Neighborhood". Come on over here. Hey, this is Ryan. - He's temping upstairs. - What's up? - This is the foreman, Mister Rogers. - Not my real name. No, Darryl is Mister Rogers. - Darryl Rogers? - Darryl Philbin.

I mean, I can tell her it's part of the job. Rapport. No, I know that the warranty's expired but isn't it supposed to last longer than two years if it isn't defective? OK, fine, three years. Pam gets a little down. Her toaster oven broke. Which she got at her engagement shower. For a wedding that still has yet to be set. And that was three years ago. So, one o'clock sharp and we've got a game on. - We're loading at one. - I see, you're chickening out on me. No, we got a truck going out at 1:15. That's the busy time. Well, I'm glad that some time is a busy time because whenever I'm down here it doesn't seem too busy to me. Oh. Oh. You can dish it out but you can't take it. OK, fine, have it your way. All right, fine, you know what? One o'clock. All right, see you at one. Are we ready for the game? Yeah. I know. Grumble, grumble, but you would follow me to the ends of the earth, grumbling all the way. Like that dwarf from Lord Of The Rings. - Gimli. - Nerd. That is why you're not on the team. - Just trying to be helpful. - "I'll help. Elwyn Dragonslayer "Ten points, power sword. " That's him. So let's put together a starting line-up, shall we? - Stanley, of course. - I'm sorry? - What do you play, center? - Why "of course"? What's that supposed to mean? I don't know. I don't remember saying that. - I heard it. - Well, people hear a lot of things, man. Um other starters Me, of course. I heard it that time. I'd like to play if it's just for fun. I played basketball in school. Um Yeah. Who else? We have Jim. We have Ryan, the new guy, right? Untested. Willing to prove himself now. A lot of passion, a lot of heart. - I'm getting paid to skip lunch? - Yes. - OK. - Yes. This is business. The business of team building and morale boosting. - Uh who else? - I can help out if you need me. I will use your talents come baseball season. Or if we box. - I have a hoop in my driveway. - No. - I have a sports bra. - No, ridiculous. Michael, look. Close. All right.

Threat neutralized. Off the backboard! - Please don't throw garbage at me. - Oh, Pam, with a zinger. Hey, Pam, how would you like to be our cheerleader today? You know, some pigtails, a little haltertop, tie that up. And something a little, just, youthful, for a change. - Just this once. - I don't think so, Michael. Besides, I can't cheer against my fiancé. I'll do it. Wear a little flouncey skirt if you want, and I bet you would. Just try not to be too gay on the court. And by gay I mean you know, not in a homosexual way at all. I mean the uh, you know, like the bad-at-sports way. - I think that goes without saying. - Maybe Angela would cheerlead. - Yeah, right. - I'll do it. Yuk. That's worse than you playing. Cos we need you as an alternate in case somebody gets hurt. That's where we need you. Blessed be those who sit and wait. You made it. Suit up, you're on the team! All right, cool! Very good. Oh-oh. Oh-oh. A spy from the warehouse. Trying to figure out our plays? - Just getting a tea bag. - He's running. He's running but he can't hide because one o'clock, you better bring your A game. Because me and my posse guys are gonna be in your face. - Right in your face! - Why don't we make it more interesting? Loser buys dinner at Farley's. Wo-ho. I like the way you think. I'm gonna take that one step further. Loser works on Saturday. No, that's not as much fun. - You know what? - What? - You're on. - OK. Cool. You're on. Don't screw this up. Classic beginner's mistake - eating before a game. Has anyone seen the first-aid kit? How many times have I told you? I'm the safety officer, not you. Basketball? It was my thing in high school. And, yeah, I'm looking forward to playing. I think I'm gonna impress a few people in here. - You coming down? - Yeah, I'm just forwarding the phones. - Gonna wish me luck? - Yeah, you're gonna need it. Is that trash talk from Pam?
