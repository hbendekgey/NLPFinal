Yeah, I'm not a temp anymore. I got Jim's old job, which means at my 10-year high school reunion, it will not say, "Ryan Howard is a temp. " It will say, "Ryan Howard is a junior sales associate "at a mid-range paper supply firm. " That'll show them. You have no idea how long I've wanted to do that. Me, too. I think we're just drunk. No, I'm not drunk. Are you drunk? No. Jim. You're really going to marry him? Okay. Jim is gone. He's gone. I miss him so much. I cry myself to sleep. Jim. False. I do not miss him. No. That is the fun of this place. I call everybody faggy. Why would anyone find that offensive? Okay. I think Oscar would just like it if you used lame or something like that. That's what faggy means. No, not really. Oh. Apparently you called Oscar faggy. Yeah. For liking the movie Shakespeare in Love more than an action movie. It wasn't just an action movie, it was Die Hard. All right, Michael, but Oscar's really gay. Exactly. I mean for real. Yeah, I know. No. He's attracted to other men. Okay. Little too far. Crossed the line. Okay. I am telling you, Oscar is an actual homosexual. Yeah. He told me this morning. And obviously he hopes he can count on your discretion. I would have never called him that if I knew. You don't call retarded people retards. It's bad taste. You call your friends retards when they're acting retarded. And I consider Oscar a friend. Listen, man, I am so sorry. I had no idea. Oh, it's fine. It's okay. It's okay. No. No. It's okay. No, it's not. I just I feel terrible about it. I have been calling people faggy since I was in junior high, and I have never made this mistake. If I don't know how to behave, it is because I am just so far the opposite way. You know? I'm just I I can't even imagine the thing Maybe we could go out for a beer sometime and you could tell me how you do that to another dude. That sounds like a great, wonderful idea. Let's do that. It explains so much. No. I'm not gay. And I don't understand why anyone would think that I'm gay if Yeah, I'm gay. I can't say whether Dunder Mifflin paper is less flammable, sir, but I can assure you that it is certainly not more flammable. Why did I transfer to Stamford? I think that's pretty obvious. I got promoted. And you can't beat that view, right? Hey, Big Tuna, you're single, right? Yeah, I am. Pretty hot, huh? She's completely crazy. Steer clear, Big Tuna. Head for open waters. Okay. Okay. I ate a tuna sandwich on my first day, so Andy started calling me Big Tuna. I don't think any of them actually know my real name. Big Tuna is a super ambitious guy, you know, cut your throat to get ahead type of guy. But, I mean, I'm not threatened by him. I went to Cornell. You ever heard of it? I graduated in four years, I never studied once, I was drunk the whole time and I sang in the a cappella group Here Comes Treble. So, end of day we are going to have a little diversity policy freshener because of some more problems at the Scranton branch. And I have a list of business start-ups I got from the chamber. Yes. I am going to need someone to cold call them. Oh, I can do that. Jim's nice enough. I don't know how well he's fitting in here. He's always looking at the camera, like this. What is that? Can you tell who's gay and who is not? Of course. What about Oscar? Absolutely not. Well, he is. Well, he's not dressed in women's clothes, so There could be others. I need to know. I don't want to offend anybody else. You could assume everyone is and not say anything offensive. Yeah. I'm sure everyone would appreciate me treating them like they were gay. Hey, what about Angela? She's hard and severe. She could be a gay woman. I really don't think so. I don't know. I can imagine her with another woman, can't you? Do some research. Find out if there's a way to tell by just looking at them. Jim told me you could buy gaydar online. That's ridiculous. Yeah. Probably. He didn't tell the truth a lot. Let's call him and get the website. Definitely. What's gaydar? Oh, oh, gaydar, yes! No, I think they have it at Sharper Image. Oh, you know what? I can check for you. No problem. It's sold out. Yeah. Sorry about that. That's a bummer. They're sold out. Damn. I'll try Brookstone. I miss that. Chicken or fish? Chicken. So, you having a good day? Excellent. Thanks. Good. I'm glad. Okay. Yeah, I didn't go through with the wedding. I got cold feet a few days before, and I can't really explain it. I just had to get out of that relationship. We still had to pay for all the food, so we froze it. But I'm doing well. I have my own apartment and I'm taking art classes. And I have lunch for the next five weeks. After Pam dumped me, I kind of stopped taking care of myself for a while there, and I hit bottom when I had a drunk driving arrest. Yeah, I've been working out and, you know, I'm not going to take her for granted. I got to win her back. I got them a toaster. They called off the wedding and gave the toaster back to me. I tried to return the toaster to the store and they said they no longer sold that kind of toaster. So now my house has got two toasters. It is so cool that you're gay. I totally underestimated you. Yes, I am super cool. I am an accountant at a failing paper supply company in Scranton. Much like Sir Ian McKellen. Sure, sometimes I watch Will &amp; Grace and I want to throw up. It's terribly loud. I do like it sometimes when Harry Connick Jr. Is on. He's so talented. Okay, who put my calculator in JELL-O? Good one. But, seriously, guys, who did this? Seriously, guys. Who did this? I need to know who put my calculator in JELL-O or I'm going to lose my freaking mind! You know, it's amazing to me that in this day and age, you can be so obtuse about sexual orientation. I watch The L Word, okay? Good. Good. I watch Queer as so That's not what it's called. Okay, Michael, are you aware that you outed Oscar today? What? What does that even Coming out is a significant moment for a gay person. And they should be allowed to select the timing and manner of announcing it. Well, gay pride, right? Gay pride parade. It's not, like, gay shame festival. All right, now Oscar's feeling discriminated against by his co-workers, primarily Angela, and that's your fault. I think Angela might be gay. Could Oscar and Angela be having a gay affair? No! Maybe. Is that what this is about? No. No. It's not possible. I don't Anything's possible. Okay, you know, imagine you were gay. Well, I'm not gay, Jan, and you should know that better than anybody. Michael, your immaturity is extremely disappointing and may even lead to a lawsuit, which is the absolute last thing this company needs right now. Yes. Do you understand? I know. The company has made it my responsibility today to put an end to 100,000 years of being weirded out by gays. Am I the first gay man you ever knew? Trick question. 'Cause you can't always tell, so how would I know? Was that the right answer? Yup. Michael, Dwight's looking at gay pornography on his computer. Michael knows, Pam, okay? He asked me to do this just for him. He has his own reasons. Okay. Nothing wrong with this stuff at all. This is fine. You know what? Gay porn, straight porn, it's all good. I don't particularly get into this but, you know what, I totally see the merit. And actually, it is quite beautiful. Oh, damn pop-ups. What are you doing? Watching some of your friends. This is stupid. Excuse me. Don't touch me! Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Stop it! All right, everybody in the conference room! I don't care if you are gay, or straight, or a lesbian or overweight, just get in here! Right now! Did you know that gay used to mean happy? When I was growing up, it meant lame. And now it means a man who makes love to other men. We're all homos, Homo sapiens. Gays aren't necessarily who you think they are What?  people. I mean, anybody can be gay. Businessmen, like antique dealers, or hairdressers or accountants. Oscar, why don't you take this opportunity to officially come out to everybody here however you want to do it? Go ahead. Stand up. I'm doing this for you. Yes, I'm gay. And I didn't plan on sharing that part of my life with you today, so, whatever. Can I sit down now? I'm not offended by homosexuality. In the '60s, I made love to many, many women, often outdoors, in the mud and the rain, and it's possible a man slipped in. There would be no way of knowing. Who should be the judges and juries of our society? Judges and juries. Yes. That's a good point. She has a good point. Because gay marriage currently is not legal under U.S. Law. I bet a lot of straight men wished that applied to them so they could go out there and have some torrid, unabashed monkey sex as much as they could. You know? Sounds pretty good, right? That sounds great. Yeah, Dwight. I think all the other office gays should identify themselves or I will do it for them. No one else in this office is gay. What about Phyllis? She makes absolutely no attempt to be feminine. I'm getting married to Bob Vance. You are? No way! Congratulations, Phyllis. When did you get that? That's great. Congratulations, Phyllis. That is great, and frankly, kind of amazing. See? Everybody has a chance. Thank you. But, still Phyllis, in college, did you ever experiment with other women? A lot of women do. No, and you knew me in high school. Of course, we all thought you were gay in high school. Right. And I take that as a compliment. Well, with your ties and your matching socks Well, I just like to look good, okay? So You sound pretty defensive, Michael. No. I am just coming out myself. I am coming out hetero! I think the problem with this office is that you are sending mixed signals about my being here. No. No. The only signal that I am sending is gay good! Look, if I was gay, I would be the most flamboyant gay you've ever seen. I would be leading the parade covered in feathers and just I'd be waving that rainbow flag. I don't think I can work here any longer. This has been the worst, most backwards day of my life. You misunderstand Okay. All right You know what? Okay. Okay. I'm going to put my money where my mouth is. You ready? What are you doing? I am going to embrace Oscar. You might want to watch us, Angela, because you can't catch anything. Here we go. No. We are going to make a statement. You and I are going to make a statement together. Oscar is my friend. I'd rather not. And I just don't care who sees it. Doesn't bother me. Really, I really would rather not. Come here, friend. I'd really rather not. You're my friend. No! No! I don't want to touch you. Ever considered that? You're ignorant and insulting and small. Okay. All right. I'm sorry. Michael, I'm sorry. That was a good idea. Come on. Come on. All right. I'm sorry I called you faggy. I know. I know. You're not faggy. I know you are. You're a good guy. You, too. Michael appears to be gay, too. And yet he is my friend. I guess I do have a gay friend. You know what, I'm going to raise the stakes. You don't I want you to watch this and I want you to burn this into your brains. I don't think we need to do this Because this is an image that I want you people to remember for a long time to come. Whenever you come into the office, I want you to think about this. We don't need to. Yes, we do. What? I did it! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. See, I'm still here. We're all still here. Oh, come on, Dwight! Come on, man! We are not in the playground anymore. There are new rules. We have to be mature, but we can't lose the spirit of childlike wonder. What is love anyway? Maybe it's supposed to break all the rules. Like me and Jan. Or Oscar and some guy. Life is short. When two people find each other, what should stand in their way? It is very easy for you to be a hero. All you need are honesty, empathy, respect and open-mindedness. I'm glad if today spurred social change. That's part of my job as regional manager. But, you know what, even if it didn't, at least we put this matter to bed. That's what she said. Or he said. Oh, there's Gil, Oscar's roommate. I wonder if he knows. I was going to quit, but Jan offered me a three-month, paid vacation and a company car. All I had to do was sign something saying I won't sue. Gil and I are going to Europe. Kids, sometimes it pays to be gay. "Hope this helps. Jim. " Nice. What are you doing? Don't be scared. It works. Oh, no. Pam? Yeah? Did you see Oprah yesterday? No, I didn't. I I'm going to be a father. What was Oprah about? Angelina Jolie was on. And she adopted a baby from Asia, and she said that it changed her life, and that really inspired me. So I want you to look into see how much a little Chinese baby would cost. That's a really big decision. I know. Maybe you should wait before you adopt. Well Or not adopt. Just do it, okay? Roy's sister looked into it and the application alone costs $1,000. Well, find out if there's a cheaper, less expensive baby out there, okay? You know, she also said the waiting list is, like, eight months. Eight months? Yeah. I don't even know if I want a baby in eight months. Probably won't. You know what, Pam? If in 10 years, I haven't had a baby and you haven't had a baby No, Michael. Twenty years. No, Michael. Thirty. Sure. It's a deal. All right, three pairs of pants. Three pairs of socks. Mmm-hmm. Three packs of condoms. Yes. Fun jeans. Right there. Sign. Per diem. Guess where I am going? I will give you a hint. It is a booze-fuelled sex romp where anything goes. You are correct, sir! I am headed to Philadelphia for the annual Northeastern Mid-Market Office Supply Convention. And Jim Halpert is going to be coming, which'll be fun. Poor little guy has been stuck working under Josh, the poor man's Michael Scott, as he is known around my condo. Don't be mad, it is a business trip. But I don't understand. It's for managers. Monkey, I am an ARM, Assistant Regional Manager. I know! It's I was just really hoping we could spend some time together. Are you still there? Yes, monkey. Don't "monkey" me! You can't wait to get out of here, ARM! In the Martin family, we like to say, "Looks like someone took the slow train from Philly. " That's code for "Check out the slut. " What is Why are there flies in here? Oh, my God! Are you so excited for tonight? I'm so excited. You guys are gonna click, I can feel it. So what are you wearing? This. You look so pretty. Thank you. Yes, I have a date. He's a cartoonist for the local paper, which is really neat, because I like to draw, too. I'm kind of nervous. I haven't been on a first date in nine years. Probably shouldn't broadcast that. Well, remember, no matter how much you may want to, do not sleep with him on the first date, it gives him all the power. Sleep with who? Whom? Whom? Whom? My neighbor, Alan. They're going on a date tonight. Oh, wow! Oh, my God, I have a great idea. You know what you should do? Be hilarious. Wear your wedding dress. It'd be a great icebreaker! And your veil. Yeah. Do it! I'll probably just wear this. Really? Okay, well, word of advice, unbutton that top button, let those things breathe. Any message you want me to relate to Jim? Um "Um," okay. You got that? I got it. Write it down. I'll write it down. Um, um, um, um There's my girl. Noticed you handing out some shekels. How would one get on that train? That was per diem for Philadelphia. That town smells like cheese steaks. That town is full of history! Andrea's the office bitch. You'll get used to her. Creed. Can I have my neck pillow back? Michael! Can I have my neck pillow back? Hey, Michael. Hey, Josh, how you doing? Pretty good, how you doing? Good to see you. There he is! There's the traitor. Traitor! Traitor! Come here, you. Come here! The The progidal My son returns! I was shocked when he told me he was transferring to Stamford. It's like with firemen, you don't leave your brothers behind. Even if you find out that there is a better fire in Connecticut. It's really good to see you, man. Yeah. Wow. I didn't expect that. It's good to see you, too. Oh, hey, how's it going up there? Have you made any sales yet? Yeah, sold about 40,000. Hey! Shut up, that's impossible. No, it's not, and I did, yeah. Well, I did it, too. You know, when I saw Dwight, I realized how stupid and petty all those pranks I pulled on him were. And then he spoke. I wonder how hard it would be to get a copy of his room key. So did you hear? What? Pam's back on the market again. Really? She's dating? If I weren't engaged, I would so hit that. So what kind of commissions you get up there? Oh, Dwight, I missed you so much. You're so immature. Listen, Michael, I heard you were a great salesman, and I just wanted to let you know that if our branch absorbs your branch, I'm gonna look for a place for you in Stamford. Oh, hey! Hey. Hey, Jan. We all checked in? Yes. Great. Let's dump our stuff and meet back down here in half an hour. Okay. Okay. Jan? Look, I think we need to set some ground rules. What are you talking about? The 800-pound gorilla in the room. Carole? I'm still dating her, so nothing can happen between us at the convention. Step away from me, Michael. Thank you for being so brave with all of this. Thank you. Alan's cartoon's so funny, right? And they're, like, so smart. I don't even know what they mean half the time. This party is gonna be awesome! I know! That is specifically why I chose a room close to the elevator. More foot traffic. Check it out. That is crooked. On that side. Wow. Hey, hey! That is a lot of liquor. Yeah. And a dartboard. Well, that's how we do it in Scranton, or did you forget? Ain't no party like a Scranton party 'cause a Scranton party don't stop! We should probably head on down, you know, hook up with Jan. Hey, well, we have time! One for the road, gentlemen? "A shot of Midori, perhaps?" Oh, no, sorry, it's an inside joke. There's this bartender in Stamford who You know what? You just had to be there. I wish I was! I love inside jokes. Love to be a part of one someday. We should Yeah! All right, see you guys down there. See you guys. All right. Change your mind, come back up. I'll do a shot with you, Michael. Don't be gross. It's not even lunch yet. Swag! Stuff we all get. I basically decorated my condo for free with all of my swag! Check it out! Oh, my God. Hi! I'm Michael Scott, Dunder Mifflin. Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager, Dunder Mifflin. All right. I'm a huge fan. Thanks, appreciate it, guys. You know what? I'm having a big blowout tonight, Room 308, hope you can come. All right, maybe. If I can. Well, cool! Okay, so can I tell people you're gonna be there? No, you cannot. So maybe. See you. Why do they call him "The Bus"? Because he's afraid to fly. Smile! Do you remember me from last year? There's a party in my room, 308. Can't miss it, right off the elevator. Tonight! Be there! All right, Jan just e-mailed me. She wants us to meet her up front. Yup! Yeah, she's up front. You don't have e-mail on your phone. I don't have to, I just know. Yes? Hello? No one just called you. All right. Nice meeting you. Take care. Nice to meet you. I'll see you soon. Yeah, stop by. Take care. See you in a bit. Bye-bye. May I have a moment of your time, please? I need you to do something for me. Yes, anything. I want you to dig up some dirt on Josh, find out if there are any skeletons in his attic. I'll talk to my buddy down at the station, stat. Hey, Pam. Hey, what's up? It's How are I might ask if you wanted Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. He's not in the office. Can I take a message? I will. You, too. Sorry, what's up? Lf I just completely forgot what I was gonna say. It's so weird. Okay. Well, if you think of it, I'll be here. Okay. So I called my buddy down at the station today to have him run a background check on Josh Porter, see if there's any known aliases, etcetera. And? He wasn't volunteering today. Yeah. Things have been pretty crazy around the office. Oh, yeah? Yeah. We moved Ryan over to your desk Tell him I say hi. I will call him later with that message. Hey, how's Toby? Toby Flenderson is everything that is wrong with the paper industry. Is he why you left? Oh, no, it was just, you know, a good opportunity for me, a promotion. I got a chance to Opportunity, promotion, blah, blah You know, Jim, those are just words. Have you taken into account other factors, vis-a-vis bosses? Is Josh funnier than I am? Does he even have a girlfriend? Because I have two, basically. Michael, it's really not a competition. Jim got us a great lead with the new rep from National Envelope. - Really? Great. - We can grab lunch with him tomorrow. Hey, Jan? Jan? Don't worry, I have got the tip. Whoa, Michael! Wow! Oh, my God, thank you! Hey, no problem. Was that your per diem? No, that was a different $100 bill. What have you generated, Michael? I have generated a lot of interest in my party this evening. What party? The party I'm having tonight in 308, obviously, you are invited. Michael, Jim and Josh are in meetings all day, and I am in and out of meetings. I I can't stay on top of you 24l7. You should order the most expensive thing on the menu. So he knows you're worth it. If you do that, you're gonna have to put out. Oh, yeah, you'll have to put out. Is there a key for a Jane Doe? Thank you. Any messages for 308? All right. Hey, hey, fellers. Michael! Hey, Michael! What's up? Well, Jim and I have a meeting with uni-ball in about 45 minutes, so we should probably go now. Hey, check this out! How about that? A little friendly competition. Stamford versus Scranton. I don't think so I don't really Jim, looks like you picked a bad time to defect, my friend. Fine, all right. Okay! Excellent. Do the wing flaps. Oh, just shut it. Hey, Pam, what's up? Yeah. No, tell him I will give him general specifics tomorrow, okay? Yes. Say hi to Pam! Hi, Pam! Hi, Pam. Yes. That is Josh and Dwight and Jim. Pam says hi. Have fun on your date. Very good, talk to you later. Bye. You first! Come on. Nice try, Josh! Not. Hit the Hit the rim. Okay, and Okay, double or nothing. On what? We didn't bet anything, Michael, we Well, we Let's You know, we should go. We gotta go. Come on. Come on! We'll do it later. Let's go Say, while I have you here, could I talk to you about some new and exciting advances to our product line? Fine. Jim and I have different definitions of friendship. I think it's talking and being friends, and Jim thinks it's moving to Connecticut and being best friends with Josh. Well Phooey on that. I'm done. I am not going to be speaking with him anymore. Whatevs. Long-distance relationships never work. That is so true. Ready? Okay, let me tell you what we're looking for. Great. Sorry, my meeting ran late. Really? Yes, Jan, really, with the rep from Hammermill. They're exclusive with Staples. Used to be. Evan'll call you in the morning to work out the details. We can now sell Hammermill products. Yes! Well, Michael, I just I underestimated you. Yeah, well, maybe next time you will estimate me. Dwight's room key. And Dwight's room. What can I say? Old habits die hard. D? Oh, my God! Dwight got a hooker! Oh, my God, I gotta call Well, I gotta call somebody, I don't even know who to call. Dwight got a hooker! So, Alan, Pam is obsessed with your cartoons. She reads them every day. Oh, great. I don't like ketchup. You love ketchup! He loves ketchup. So how do you come up with your cartoons? Oh, I just I kind of think about stuff that I see. Or dream them. You dream in cartoons? How fun. Hey! First guest! You are going to have some tequila, my friend. I thought there was a party in here. This is the party. This is Room 308? Party central! So what can I do you for? All right. See, this one is great because it could work on a couple different levels. "More freedom fries for the table?" "Freedom fries". Yeah. Yeah, I mean, people always say, like, "Don't be edgy," but I don't know I don't know any other way. Yeah, you got it. Well, it was It was really nice meeting you, Alan. Yeah, next time bring some of your illustrations. I'll let you pick my brain. "More freedom fries"! Yeah! That's great. Okay. I went on a date. It wasn't a love connection. I think when I like someone again, I'll just kind of know. Michael. Am I the first to arrive? People have been filtering in and out. Can I get a drink? What? Can I get a drink? Sure. Do you like Cosmos? Yeah, sure, sounds good. So why are you here? Is Josh busy? Michael I get it! Did I do something or No. No, I totally get it! He made a better paper airplane, Stamford does better in sales. You I get it, we had some fun. We had some laughs Wait, wait, wait. I didn't transfer because of you. You're a good boss. You're a great boss. I'm not better than Josh. Michael, it's not about I transferred because of Pam. Oh, my God. You don't even know. She's single now. No, I I heard something about that. It's just I kind of put it all on the line. Twice, actually. And she said no. Twice. I'm sorry, man, I'm sorry, it's Hey, you know what? I will talk to her. Nope, that's okay. Yeah. No, that's all right. I will. I'll talk to her. You should at least talk to Roy, I mean, he knows exactly how you're feeling, just Yeah. Okay, maybe. Are we early? Hey! No, you know, people have been filtering in and out. Hey. Evan, this is Jim. How are you? Hey, Arnie Rissman, Michael, Jim. Hey, Arnie, how you doing? You guys work together? No, we used to. Yeah. Now we're friends. Best friends. Some people need dozens of friends to say, "Hey, look at me, I'm popular!" But not me. I'm very picky. I need three, maybe two. When you meet that someone special, you'll just know, because a real relationship, it can't be forced. It should just come about effortlessly. Now would you do me the pleasure of hitting the lights, sir? What are all those stains? Blood, urine, or semen. Oh, God, I hope it's urine. I'm hungry. Movie Monday! The only cure I know for the Monday blues is Varsity Blues. Let's go! Let's go, let's go, let's go! Take a seat down there. Second from the end. All right. Everybody here? Yes! Popcorn, anyone? Yes, please! Thank you. Anyone else? No. Movie Monday started with training videos. But we went through those pretty fast. Then we watched a medical video. Since then, it's been half-hour installments of various movies, with the exception of an episode of Entourage, which Michael made us watch six times. Entourage. Kevin? Would you like to do the scenes from last week? Yes. Why him? Don't whine. Get the windows. Previously on Varsity Blues Okay, Billy Bob got a head injury, but Coach made him play. So then Lance, he gets sacked and he's out for the year. Hello? Not everyone approves of Movie Monday. I won't say who. I don't approve. I don't. Hello? Let's go after that title now. Let's go, let's go! Let's go! Hi, Jan. Hope you brought the Milk Duds. How would a movie increase productivity, Michael? How on Earth would it do that? People work faster after. Magically? No. They have to, to make up for the time they lost watching the movie. No. Do I need to hire a babysitter for you, Michael? Kitchen. Some little 14-year old girl whose job it is, is to limit Michael is going to get us all fired. You sat back and let him play that dumb movie and now Jan is peeved off and we're all going to lose our jobs. That's not going to happen. You know she has it out for him now! That's not his fault! He had to follow his heart. Ever since Michael dumped Jan for Carole, Jan's been bitching out on him. Reject a woman, and she will never let it go. One of the many defects of their kind. Also weak arms. Dwight, you should be running this office. Michael would never let me. It's not up to Michael, it's Jan's call. Talk to her. I could never do that. Fine! Sit back and do nothing and let us all get fired. I know that patience and loyalty are good and virtuous traits, but sometimes I just think you need to grow a pair. At the Stamford branch, they all play this World War II videogame called Call of Duty. And they're all really into it. I'm told that it started as a teambuilding exercise. Unfortunately, I really suck at it. We didn't play many videogames in Scranton. Instead, we'd do stuff like Pam and I would sometimes hum the same high-pitched note and try to get Dwight to make an appointment with an ear doctor. And Pam called it Pretendonitis. Hey, Kelly, my stuff just got here. Oh! Oh, my God! Kelly really likes to online shop. So, I felt like I wanted some new clothes. I mean, I just I wanted to It's just, I felt like it was time to maybe, just get new clothes. Okay. I love it! Really? I don't know. No, you haven't even tried it on yet. Try it on. Not at work. I'll try it on Fashion show. Fashion show at lunch! No Fashion show, fashion show at lunch. Fashion show! Fashion show! Fashion show at lunch! Why did you do that? I'm just killing Germans any way I can. We're on the German team. Shoot the British. Wait, are we playing teams? Yeah. Hello? Is this Jan? Who is this? This is Dwight Schrute. I am calling about an extremely sensitive matter. You should talk to Michael and he'll talk to me, and that way we don't have to speak to each other. It's about Michael. What about him? I can't talk here. It's too sensitive. It's not about a surprise party, is it? No, but we should discuss that another time. Look, I'm already an hour outside of Scranton, Dwight, I'm not coming back. Pull over at Exit 40. There is a Liz Claiborne outlet. I know you like that store. Go inside and shop until I can meet you. How do you know I like that store? Many of your blouses are Claibornes. How do you know that? It's part of my job. No, it's not. It's officially not. Noted. I'm going to the dentist. Okay. I have to have an emergency crown put in. Yes. It's a new dentist. He's far. I might be gone three hours. Three hours? Wow! Have fun. Did you get anything good? Yeah. New blouse? Halter-top? Camisole? Teddy? I could save the branch. Really? If you let me run it. Okay. Okay, I can run it? What would you do differently? Mostly get rid of waste, which is half the people there. And clean house. Right here, it's all for me. Thank you. Dwight, you must feel strongly to speak with me this way, behind Michael's back, and turn on so many of your co-workers. The decision to turn on Michael was difficult. But once I did it, I didn't look back. And mostly I feel that Michael would approve. It's really what's best for the branch. And I could care less about my co-workers. So, here we are. It's all on the table. I want the branch. And I await your decision. Oh, by the way, there's a new Ann Taylor outlet store near here. I know you like their earrings. Where is it? Michael! Hi. I had a very interesting conversation with one of your employees. Oh, that's nice. No, it wasn't. Dwight just told me that he thinks he can run the branch better than you. What? You were at the dentist? You can't have people undermining you. Get control of your branch immediately. Okay. What was Dwight thinking? That he could turn Jan against me? She's my ex-lover-ish. Wow! It's so sexy! You look so hot. It's really something. It's too much. What? I'm gonna return it. No. You have to keep it today, just see how you feel. Hey. Hi. You look nice. Thanks. Isn't that, like, your third soda today? Yeah, I think we can be a big help to your company. Okay, see you next week. Bye. Again? Scared? Call of Duty. Andy, Jim, can I see you in the conference room for a minute? Now? Yes, now. Put the game on hold, everyone. This is not working, okay? We are getting slaughtered out there. It's the new guy. Oh, I'm sorry, I don't know what we're talking about. See what I mean? We just need a strategy, okay? We're gonna set up a trap in the gunroom. All right? Jim, are you using the MP40 or the. 44? Sniper rifle? Snipe What? Jim! In Carentan? Are you playing for the other team? You don't snipe in Carentan, okay? It's saboteur! Saboteur! Andy, it's not I'm gonna kill you for real. This game, the game is over. I'm really going to shoot you. Hey, Dwight. Hey. Do you want an M&amp;M;? No, thanks. I'm stuffed. No, seriously, you should have an M&amp;M;, they're really good. Okay. Good, huh? So good. Hey, I thought you weren't supposed to eat anything for a couple of hours after you've had a crown put in. They have this new kind of quick-drying bonding. So Sounds like a good dentist. Oh, yeah. What's his name? Crentist. Your dentist's name is Crentist? Yeah. Sounds a lot like dentist. Maybe that's why he became a dentist. Let me see your teeth. Let me see them. Let me see them. You should floss them. I know. Well, then. I'm glad you're okay. Business is like a jungle. And I am like a tiger. And Dwight is like a monkey that stabs the tiger in the back with a stick. Does the tiger fire the monkey? Does the tiger transfer the monkey to another branch? Pun. There's no way of knowing what goes on inside the tiger's head. We don't have the technology. Dwight, can I talk to you for a second? Wow. This is tough! What? What is it? Well I just got off the phone with Jan. And She demoted me. No. Yeah. You know what the craziest part of this is? She demoted me to your job. And she said that you should be expecting a call later from corporate, and that I guess that means that you are going to be acting manager of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. I can't believe this news. That Wow! Yeah. I told her I didn't know whether you'd want to do it because you've always been so loyal to me. You've been my most trusted ally. You said that? Yup, I did. I did. But I think you should do it. Well, gosh, if you think I should then I will. Perfect. Well, we're settled. All right. All right. Well, then you are now Acting Manager of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton branch, and I am Assistant Regional Manager. Assistant to the Regional Manager. Thank you, Michael, for staying on, I really appreciate it. Oh Hey, hey. I can't imagine this place without you. Can't you? That's so nice. Well, I guess we should go tell the troops. Yeah, when I'm ready, Mike. Okay, let's do it. Hey, hi, hello, everybody. I have some good news and I have some bad news. I am being replaced as your leader by Dwight. You're kidding. You might think that I am kidding, and I understand that. Congratulations, Dwight. Thank you, Angela. But, why Dwight? Because Dwight never lies. How does that qualify him to run a branch? Because that's all it takes. Okay, Dwight, would you like to say a few words to everybody about loyalty? Thank you, Michael. I just want to say, to the few of you who will remain under my employ, that I intend to lead you into the black with ferocity! Michael? What will you do? Oh, I'll be fine. Do you have any savings? No, no, I don't. But Michael, you might lose your condo. I won't. I won't. I have this little old vacuum cleaner that's broken. If Dwight doesn't work out, maybe that could be manager. Maybe I'll quit. It's really happening. Yes. We can make a difference here. I will make a difference here. You alone? 'Cause I thought together we were Oh, please! Don't be naive. But you can be in charge of the women. Look how cute he is. And he's trying to shoot with a smoke grenade. I'm sorry, what are you whispering about me? No, nothing. Just concentrate on turning around. Yeah, I'm trying, I just Just tap "S" then "D." Oh. Any last words? No? What? Wow! Psychopath. What? I'm just looking. Please go back to your desk. In a minute. Well, I remember why I dress the way I do at work. But I'm gonna keep the clothes. I mean, it'll just be cool to have some after-work clothes that aren't pajamas. Well, I guess it's time that I turn over the keys to the famous Sebring. No, thank you. It's a corporate lease, Dwight, you've earned it. No, thanks. What? Not my style. But you said you liked it. You've always admired it. And But that was before. I'm thinking about getting something German, something with decent gas mileage. Plus, that convertible is a ridiculous choice for this climate. Take it back. No. That's my car. What did you That's my car! Yes. I know, Dwight, I know. I know, I know. You know what? Jan called me about your little meeting! No. I know what you did. You The Sebring's cool I made the whole thing up, Dwight! It's cool, the Sebring's cool Oh, do you? Do you like it? And has a cassette and a CD. How dare you? How dare you, Dwight? Don't fire me. Please, don't Give me one good reason why I shouldn't fire you right here on the spot? I have excellent sales numbers! Not good enough! I'll do anything! Anything! Please, I'll do your laundry for a month! For a year! I have a laundry machine! I'm sorry. Anything I'II Please? Please? I don't know if I can trust you anymore. You can't. You can't, but I promise I'll never betray you again. What can I do, Michael? What can I do? What can I do? What can I do? What can I do? You can get up. What? Get up. And you can hug it out, bitch. "Hug it out, bitch. " That is what men say to each other after a fight. They hug it out. And in doing so, they just let it go. And walk away, and they're done. Not a good idea to say that to a woman, however, I have found. Doesn't translate. Yup, yup, we hugged it out. But it turns out I was still a little angry and so I felt I needed to punish him just a little bit more. And I'm making him do my laundry for a year. Hey, Ryan, can I get you a pencil from the warehouse? Oh, no, thanks. I'm good. Well, it's okay. I'm going down. Yeah. Absolutely. All right, I'll be right back. Awesome. Thank you. You're welcome. Michael, could you get me a pen from down in the warehouse? Don't mind if I do. See you in a minute. Okay! There you go, fresh from the warehouse. Hey, Michael, would you get me some coffee from the warehouse? There's coffee in the kitchen, Pam. But the warehouse coffee tastes so much better. Yeah. It's better. Okay. Great. All right, okay. I am like Bette Midler in For The Boys. Gotta keep the troops entertained. With cream and sugar? All right. So, I wanted to let you know that we lost Ed Truck. Okay, let me see if I have his cell. Is this the only reason you are calling, Jan, or does somebody miss me? Michael, Ed died over the weekend. Oh, wow. Attention, everybody! I just received a call from corporate with some news that they felt that I should know first. My old boss, Ed Truck, has died. Oh, Michael, that's such terrible news. You must feel so sad. Yes, I am. It's very sad, because he was my boss. Oh, that's a shame. Ed was a good guy. That's right. You worked with him. So did Creed. Well, I'll be in my office in case anybody wants to drop by, cheer me up. So, did you hear the news? The news that you just announced, that Ed died? Yeah. Is there anything I can do? Oh, gosh. What can anybody do, really? It's He was almost 70. Circle of life. Yeah. Oh, okay. Yeah. Okay. What's going on with Fairfield County Schools? Karen, did you generate that price list? Shoot. I will. I'm sorry. Okay, just get it done. Jim, will you make sure? Oh, yeah, definitely. Suck up! Josh, did you hear what I said? Thank you, everyone. Damn it. What's up? Oh, nothing. We're just out of Herr's chips. Oh. But don't worry about it. My snack food doesn't fall under the umbrella of your authority. That's where you're wrong. I'm your project supervisor today and I have just decided that we're not doing anything until you get the chips that you require. So I think we should go get some. Now, please. It's a real shame about Ed, huh? Yeah. Must really have you thinking. About what? The older you get, the bigger the chance is you're gonna die. You knew that. Ed was decapitated. What? Really? He was drunk as a skunk, he was flying down Route 6, he slides under an eighteen-wheeler, pop, it snaps right off. Oh, my God. That is the way to go. Instant death, very smart. You know, a human can go on living for several hours after being decapitated. You're thinking of a chicken. What did I say? That is just not the way a Dunder Mifflin manager should go, I'm sorry. Alone, out of the blue. Not even have his own head to comfort him. So I'm not exactly sure how to say this Ed was decapitated. What are you doing? You said you didn't know how to say it. I didn't He was driving on the road and he went under a truck and that's when his head was separated from the rest of him. Now, we'll let you know more as soon as I find out. Hey. Hi. If my head ever comes off, I would like you to put it on ice. I do not want to talk about this. When I die, I want to be frozen. And if they have to freeze me in pieces, so be it. I will wake up stronger than ever because I will have used that time to figure out exactly why I died and what moves I could have used to defend myself better, now that I know what hold he had me in. I don't understand. We have a day honoring Martin Luther King, but he didn't even work here. I understand how you feel, Michael, I really do. So would it be helpful to give everyone the day off? You really don't get it, do you? You don't understand these people. That is the last thing that they would want, is a day off. Well, what would you suggest? A statue. Of Ed? Yeah. I'm not sure that's realistic. Well, I think it would be very realistic. It would look just like him. No, that's not We could have his eyes light up. Could have his arms move. That is not a statue. That is a robot. I think that is a great way to honor Ed. And how big do you want this robot? Life-size. No. Better make it two-thirds. Easier to stop if it turns on us. What the hell are you two talking about? Well, we are talking about how to properly honor a man who gave his life as regional manager of this company, Jan. You know what, Michael, I have really tried with you today and I have to get back to work. Oh, do you? So You know who wished they could get back to work is Ed Truck. So call me when you feel like But Ed Truck can't having a real conversation. Goodbye.  because he is dead! Look, I gave him a 6- foot extension cord so he can't chase us. That's perfect. Okay, that is a "no" on the West Side Market. Okay, great. I think that's enough. Can I get back to work now? Wow. Never pegged you for a quitter. I am not a quitter. I will do this all day if you want. Really? I don't know about that. Yeah, all day. What are we doing? What's the game? I want in. Oh, there's no game. We're just trying to get these chips for Karen. Did you check the vending machine? Oh, the vending machines. How did we miss that? I have no idea. We went right for the copier. And then we checked the fax machine. Yeah, nothing there. Did you check your butt? Can you imagine how much blood there was? If it happened right here, it would reach all the way to reception. Probably get on Pam. Okay, that's enough. What? We do not want to hear about this. Well, you know what? I didn't want to hear about it either, Stanley, but I did and now I can't stop picturing it. He leaves work, he's on his way home His cappa is detated from his head. You have just spit on my face. Well, you know what, there's something wrong with you. There is something wrong with everybody in here because we have lost a member of our family and you don't want to talk about it. You don't want to think about it, you just want to get back to work. There are five stages to grief, which are denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. And right now, out there, they are all denying the fact that they're sad, and that's hard, and it's making them all angry. And it is my job to try to get them all the way through to acceptance and, if not acceptance, then just depression. If I can get them depressed, then I'll have done my job. I am going to throw you this ball. When you catch the ball, I want you to say the name of a person very important to you, somebody really special, who died, and then I want you to say how they died. And you may cry if you like. That is encouraged. Let me just start. Let me show you how this works. I catch the ball. I lost Ed Truck and it feels like somebody took my heart and dropped it into a bucket of boiling tears. And, at the same time, somebody else is hitting my soul in the crotch with a frozen sledgehammer. And then a third guy walks in and starts punching me in the grief bone. And I'm crying, and nobody can hear me because I am terribly, terribly, terribly alone. Excuse me, I'm sorry to interrupt. I need to see Pam. There seems to be, like, something wrong with the radiator in her car. Okay, fine, hurry back. There's nothing wrong with your car. Just thought you might want a break from the grief counseling session. Oh, I would like a break. How are you liking the new car? Great. Yeah? It sure is small. Got air bags? I think so. I don't know. I was mainly focused on the cup-holders. Well, you still aren't driving so fast, are you? Yeah. Hi, yeah. This is Mike from the West Side Market. Well, we had a shipment of Herr's Salt &amp; Vinegar Chips and we ordered that about three weeks ago and haven't Yeah. You have them in the warehouse? Great. What is my store number? Six. What? No. I'll call you back. Shut up. Six? Okay, we can start. You waited for me? Yeah. Pam, you're a member of this family, so we will wait for our family members. Phyllis, you want to give it a shot? I got it. When my mother was pregnant with me, they did an ultrasound and found she was having twins. When they did another ultrasound a few weeks later, they discovered that I had resorbed the other fetus. Do I regret this? No. I believe his tissues made me stronger. I now have the strength of a grown man and a little baby. Okay, why don't you throw the ball to somebody else? Nope. Oh, yes, Stanley, come on. Your turn. You have to go. I will not. Okay, I'm going to toss the ball to Pam. Let's see. I had an aunt that I was really close to. She was this amazing female boxer. Anyway, she was injured in a fight, and she was paralyzed. So you can imagine how upset I was when I found out that she asked her manager to remove her breathing tube so she could die. Wow. If you want to cry, that's okay. Thanks. A few years ago, my family was on a safari in Africa, and my cousin, Mufasa, was He was trampled to death by a pack of wildebeests, and we all took it really hard. All of us kind of in the audience of what happened. Do you want to talk about it any more? Oh, it would probably take me, like, an hour and a half to tell that whole story. Me, me. Me, me, me. Me, me. Yes. Okay. I was trying to throw this party once, and everyone was over for the weekend, and then my Uncle Bernie died. And so, me and my best friend, we had to pretend like he was alive, so Wait a second. That's Weekend at Bernie's. Do you think that this is a game? Well, there is a ball All right. We're starting over. No, I'm done. You are not leaving! No, we are not done! We really have a lot of work to do. Yeah, well, you know what? The guy who had my job has died and nobody cares! And he sat at my desk. Michael, look, I know this is hard for you, but death's just a part of life. I mean, just this morning I saw a little bird fly into the glass doors downstairs and die and I had to keep going How do you know? What? That that bird was dead? Did you check its breathing? It was obvious. Was its heart beating? Toby, did you check it? No, of course you didn't. You're not a veterinarian! You don't know anything! Michael! Michael? Michael. Oh, God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Come on. Poor little fella. Oh, shoot! He's a goner. No, he's not. Yeah. No, he's not. Michael, get him away from your head! He is covered in germs and bacteria! No! You can't get diseases from a bird! A dead bird should not be in the kitchen. We don't know if it's dead. No. That thing is dead. You want me to flush him? Attention, everybody. This will only take a second of your time. Today at 4:00 p. m. We will be meeting in the parking lot to have a funeral service for this bird. I have a lot of work to do. Well, I'm sorry to inconvenience you, Meredith, but that is what you do when things die. You honor them. Toby killed this bird and now we are going to honor it. But No! No! No! That's enough! You know what? This bird is dead. He died alone. The least you can do is be there for him now. Find a box for him. I'm calling a supermarket in Montreal. Nice. Nope. Sounded good. Thanks. It's okay. It's okay. Yes, I know, I know. It's been a tough day, but it's good to let it show. I mean, how many times do I have to confirm plans with Ryan for him to know that we have a date tonight? God! What are What are you doing? What? No, this is about the right size. No, God, no! It's not! What is the matter with you? Is that the beak? I'm sorry. I grew up on a farm. We slaughtered a pig whenever we wanted bacon. My grandfather was reburied in an old oil drum. It would have fit if he had given me another minute. I need a box, I need a box. A small box. Not too confining. Is it for the bird? Yeah. I have it covered. Oh, thank you. If you want to do something for the funeral. Yes, please. Maybe you could play a song on your recorder? Excellent. Do you have it with you? Always. Did I wake up this morning thinking I'd be throwing together a bird funeral? You never can tell what your day here is gonna turn into. Where'd you find them? Where'd I find what? I called the manufacturer, who referred me to the distributor, who referred me to the vending machine company, who told me that they sell them in the machines in the building next door. Glad you could all make it. You told us we had to. Dwight, do you have the box? Actually, I have it. You made this? Wow. That's That's very nice. When I was five, my mom told me that my fish went to the hospital in the toilet and it never came back, so we had a funeral for it. And I remember thinking, "I'm a little too old for this. " And I was five. I'd also like to say a few words if that's okay. Yes. What do we know about this bird? You might think, "Not much, it's just a bird. " But we do know some things. We know it was a local bird. Maybe it's that same bird that surprised Oscar that one morning with a special present from above. I remember that. That was so funny. And we know how he died, flying into the glass doors. But you know what? I don't think he was being stupid. I think he just really, really wanted to come inside our building to spread his cheer and lift our spirits with a song. It's not a songbird. An impression, then. Lastly, we can't help but notice that he was by himself when he died, but of course we all know that doesn't mean he was alone, because I am sure that there were lots of other birds out there who cared for him very much. He will not be forgotten. Amen. Just smile for me and let the day begin You are the sunshine that lights my heart within Society teaches us that having feelings and crying is bad and wrong. Well, that's baloney, because grief isn't wrong. There's such a thing as good grief. Just ask Charlie Brown. Let's get back to work. Guys, get a broom, let's clean this up. Grab a broom, you heard me. Mush!   Brain teaser. I have two coins, totaling 15 cents. One of them is not a nickel. What are they? A dime and a nickel. No. I said one of them is not a nickel. But the other one is. I've heard that before. Okay. A man and his son get into a car accident. They are rushed to the hospital. The doctor says, "There is no way I can operate on this boy " "Because he's my son. " The doctor is the boy's mother. A man is found hanging from the ceiling He stepped on a block of ice, hung himself and the ice melted. A hunter It's a polar bear, because you're at the North Pole. Damn it! Tell me what you did yesterday. Nothing. Nothing? Yeah, nothing. How was your day? I don't care how your day was, Michael. Wow. Well, okay. I don't care how your day was either, Jan. I was just asking you because you asked me. Why do you set me up like that? Tell me what you did yesterday. I worked. And then I went home to my condo, and Carole came over and we had sex. Is that what you want to hear? Never, ever, ever sleep with your boss. I'm so lucky that Jan and I only got to second base. Hi, Pam. Hi. I'm great. So, Pam, I'd like you to keep a log of everything Michael does, hour-by-hour, so that we can analyze it at corporate, okay? I don't know if I'm Thanks, Pam. It's weird. Jan used to treat Michael like he was a 10-year old. But lately it's like he's five. So, you excited? Yeah. Very excited? Yes, I'm very excited. Extremely excited? Just very? That's cool. I have spent a year here. And I have to commit or get out. So, Dwight's the top salesman in the company and he's taking me on my first sales call today. And, I'm excited. I am very excited. Ryan hasn't made a sale yet. But more importantly, he hasn't made an ally yet. Is he gonna be a slacker, loser, wise-ass like Jim was, or is he gonna join the Dwight Army of Champions? So, what if they're not talking much? Then does it make sense to kind of lead the conversation? You know, just till it gets to a point where they are asking questions? So where is the sales office? When you are ready to see the sales office, the sales office will present itself to you. Your journey begins now. Hey. What? My chair's squeaking. Is it? You took my chair. No, I didn't. I took back the chair that you took from me, but I didn't take your chair. When you get up, I'm just gonna take it back anyway, so So I guess I can't get up? Hey, Coselli. The Cos, Cosby. Hey, hey, hey! I love Jell-O Pudding Pops. My son, Theo, loves Jell-O Pudding Pops, too. Do you know where we are, temp? I know where we're not. I hold in my hand a beet seed. Take it. When you Damn it. Hey, Big Tuna, can I talk to you for a second? Sure. Can you stand up and talk to me over there? That's it? That's what you came up with? I am acting my heart out here. Really? Yeah, really. You asked for my help, so I helped. Attention, Scranton Business Park. There will be complimentary pretzels available in the lobby from now until 4:00, as a thank you to our loyal tenants. Once a year, they bring in a little cart, and they give away free pretzels. It's really not a big deal. To some people it is. Productivity is important, but how can I be productive, if I have this one little thing in my brain that I cannot get out? And that one little thing is a soft pretzel. So, I'm just gonna have my soft pretzel, I'll get to work and I'm gonna be super-productive. Look out for me! Oh, come on. And just as you have planted your seed in the ground, I am going to plant my seed in you. I don't think you know what you're saying. It smells pretty bad, doesn't it? Uh-huh. It's called bull crap and a client can smell it from a mile away. Gotcha. Oh, hey, I forgot something in my car. I'll be right back. Okay. Of course. I wake up every morning in a bed that's too small, drive my daughter to a school that's too expensive. And then I go to work to a job for which I get paid too little. But, on pretzel day Well, I like pretzel day. 'Cause they were acting all tough and everything, Uh-huh. But what they were rapping about was cupcakes and The Chronicles of Narnia. God, who invented cupcakes, right? I don't know I want to kill them. Hey, Phyllis, what are you doing? I'm just saying hi to Bob. No, I think you're cutting in line. Well, settle down, Scott. No, I'm not gonna settle down. No way. Uh-uh. Get in the back, please. Boo! Boo! Back in line. Thank you. That's right. What a pair of marys. This is pretzel day. Hey, Dwight, you're a great salesman. Can you teach me? Sure, Ryan. I'll make you kneel in cow manure and I'll abandon you in a beet field. Oh, that sounds great, Dwight. I really appreciate that. Thank you so much. A mentor Congratulations, resourceful salesman. You have passed the second challenge. Welcome to Schrute farm! Love me, love me Say that you love me Fool me, fool me Stop. Go on and fool me Love me, love me Say that you love me This is not fair. It's gonna be in my head all day. Please. Fool me, fool me Go on and fool me Love me, love me Say that you love me This is not a proportionate response. Fool me, fool me Go on and fool me I don't care about anything but you Whatever happened to those guys? Michael. No cuts. Oh, Pam, just the woman I'd like to see. You read my mind Great, I thought you might want to use this time to authorize some checks. I thought that maybe you could wait in line for me while I go to the bathroom? You're an angel. Hey, why don't you just go up to your office and get some work done and I'll bring you a pretzel? Because I like them a certain way and if it gets screwed up then this whole thing's blown. You know, I just think that it's really important that you be productive today. Pam, productivity starts with patience and determination. I'll be back. It is time for your next test. You have planted the beet seed. You have walked the long, lonely walk of loneliness Look, man, I was in a frat in college, so I know what you're doing. I get it. You know what your problem is? You know why you haven't made any sales? 'Cause you think you know everything. You have to trust that maybe there are other people that can teach you things. Are you ready to learn? Are you ready for the final test? Yeah. Come on! Thank you. Hi, please tell me you have a sweet pretzel left. We do. Thank God. And we have 18 different toppings. We have sweet glaze, cinnamon sugar, chocolate, white chocolate, fudge, M&amp;Ms;, caramel dip, mint chip, chocolate chip, marshmallows, nuts, toffee nuts, coconut, peanut butter drizzle, Oreo, sprinkles, cotton candy bits and powdered sugar. Is there any way that you could do all of them? The works. You got it. All right! Thank you. Please be seated. What was that? Pay no attention to the spirits that haunt this hallowed ground. Is that your cousin Mose? Yes. Mose is my cousin and he lives here. He will always be my best friend. Unless things go well with Ryan today, in which case, I won't hang out with Mose so much anymore. What is the greatest danger facing Dunder Mifflin? Outsourcing and consolidation of competition. Wrong. Flash floods. What is the true cause of Robert Mifflin's suicide? Depression? Wrong. He hated himself. What is the Dharma Initiative? I can't believe that Ryan is not back yet. Where could they be? Sales take a long time. Oh, my God, I'm so worried. I'm sure Dwight will protect him. I don't know, Dwight's so weird. He's not weird, he's just individualistic. No, he's a freak. You're a freak! Final question, young Ryan Howard. What is Michael Scott's greatest fear? Loneliness. Maybe women. Wrong. He's not afraid of anything. Also, I would have accepted snakes. Fear is what it's all about. You cannot sell while undergoing fear. You need to vanquish fear! One must wrestle fear to the ground. You will now wrestle my cousin Mose! No. Okay. It's over, this is over. Okay? All right, wrestle him to the ground! No. You're a freak. No, just It's the final I'm not doing this anymore. It's part of the challenge. This is over. Goodbye. Ryan, don't Ryan, you don't have to wrestle him. Ryan, just get in the coffin. Ryan? Bye, Ryan. He seemed nice. Where are all the animals? Ryan, come on. I am sorry. I am sorry. Mose is sorry, too. Look, he sent over a basket with eggs and some fat-back bacon, and look, something he whittled. Are you still mad? It's just Jim and I didn't get along and I didn't want it to be that way again. You know, I wanted us to be a team. An unstoppable team that competed against other teams. Look, that's not what I wanted, okay? I just wanted to go on a sales call. Oh, screw gun, the sales call! Hey! Hey! Mr. Coselli? Hey, hey, hey, the Cos. What's going on? Do we have a deal? Deal or no deal? Let's make a deal. So what is the deal? Establish time frames. Keep the phrase "real dollars" in their heads. And always keep the power in the conversation. That's why you're losing them on the cold calls. 'Cause you say the word "please" too much. Wait, can you go back Michael always says, "K- I-S-S." "Keep It Simple Stupid," great advice, hurts my feelings every time. Okay, I'm going to establish time frames. Good. I'm gonna put everything in terms of real dollars. Right. I'm gonna ask a lot of questions that all have positive answers. Then I can say, "That would be better" or, "We would like that. " That sort of thing. Exactly, yeah. That's good. I am going to try to be confident but not cocky. Oh, hey everyone! I am officially streamlining the efficiency of this corporation. Second, I Second? Yes, second, Toby. Second, I am insisting on increased accountability from every single one of you. Account Michael, what is going on? And I will be taking questions. Did you have a lot of sugar today, Michael? What's on your suit? Caramel dip. But, one question at a time, please. Phyllis, Stanley, I want you to switch desks. I am going to re-organize and restructure the physical layout of the office to maximize everything. I think we're getting a lot done, don't you, on paper at least? And we are, after all, a paper company, are we not? Are we not? Are we not? Are you with me? Are you with me? Thank you very much. They really didn't like me. They did not. But they didn't have to say it to your face. I don't get it. I don't get what I did wrong. Not everything's a lesson, Ryan. Sometimes you just fail. It's those online paper jerks. The whole business is changing. You know what? They're gonna be screwed once this whole Internet fad is over. What are you doing? Oh, no, no, no! No! Ryan! Yes! Ryan the temp, yeah! Come on! Come on! Courtesy of Dunder Mifflin! Come on, drive! You drive! Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh, hi, Jim. He's on a sales call. No message? Bye, Jim. Temp! Temp! Temp! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Yes! Just think, that temp agency could have sent you anywhere. I think about that all the time. Good night, Pam. Night. Hey, what time is it? Twenty past five. A.M. Or P.M. P.M. Oh, good. These came for you, contracts, Frank Coselli. Oh, Coselli, with the Jell-O. This is a huge sale. Yes, right, good. Night, Michael. Good night. Dunder Mifflin. Hey. Oh, my God. Hi. Hi. I'm sorry, I forgot Kevin's extension. It's a fantasy football thing. And I was just gonna go through the system 'cause I didn't think you'd be there. Why are you still there? I had to work late. Jan's making me keep a log of everything Michael does all day. Oh, wow! Do you think you could send me a copy of that? Yeah, totally. So So Do you Oh, I'm sorry. Go ahead. No, I Everything's pretty much the same here. Oh, good. A little different. What time is it there? What time is it here? We're in the same time zone. Yeah, right. How far away did you think we were? I don't know. It felt far. Yeah, I have a question for you. What? How many words per minute does the average person type? I type 90. Shut up. Mavis Beacon doesn't even type 90. It's true. Okay, I said "average. " Seventy? How many do you type? Forget it. I was just about to brag. Forget it. Come on. Tell me. No. No. You have to tell me now. Sixty-five. Okay, no need to laugh. No, that's respectable. Respectable? So, okay, I'm watching the movie, by myself. Right. Because I just wanted a relaxing evening at home. Okay. And I'm freaking out. Yeah. That movie is so scary. I know. But I'm holding on because I keep waiting for Sandra Bullock to show up. No way! How do you confuse Because I got it at Blockbuster and they don't put the pictures on the box. No, you're making this up. Would I make that up? Yes. Fancy new Beesly would make that up. New apartment, new stories Oh, yeah, my fancy new apartment. I have one bedroom, one bathroom and a closet. And how many kitchens? I have one kitchen. Well, you got totally taken for a ride, Beesly. It's actually Most apartments these days have like three Three kitchens? Yes. How are you gonna cook every meal of the day in one kitchen? Hey, Ryan, are you okay? Pam? Yeah. Yeah. Pam? Okay, bye! Oh, yeah, I should probably go, too Oh, no, I was I don't know what Do you have to go? Yeah No, I should probably go, too. Okay. I mean Yeah. Yeah. Bye, Pam. Bye, Jim. Three hundred, sixty-four days till the next pretzel day. There you go. Nice dress, Ryan. It's not a dress, it's a kurta. Okay. Tonight, one of our most ethnic co-workers, Kelly, has invited us all to a Diwali celebration put on by her community. What is Diwali, you may ask? Well, to have Kelly explain it, "It's I have It's so super fun and it's gonna be great. " A lot of gods with unpronounceable names. Twenty minutes later you find out that it's essentially a Hindu Halloween. You look so handsome. You really do. I love the material. I know. How come you didn't get me one? Okay. So, between Meredith's minivan and if I borrow Bob's Yukon that should fit about 12 people. I actually might not go. I'm feeling kind of tired. Do you want to make Appletinis and watch Sex and the City at my place? Oh, I don't know. I haven't decided yet. I don't get why you won't go. Did I do something wrong? I mean, I thought we were really close friends. I just feel kind of tired, you know? Maybe you've got mono. Maybe. I just I don't really have anyone to go with. Well, go with Dwight. He's single too, right? Yeah, totally single. Hundred percent available. Are you guys going to this Indian thing tonight? I don't know. Who's Who's going? Oh, you mean like, "Is Pam going?" Don't go. They eat monkey brains. Hey, hey, hey. Stop that. That is offensive. Indians do not eat monkey brains. And if they do, sign me up because I am sure that they are very tasty and nutritional. It's important that this company celebrates its diversity. And you know what, Stanley, come Kwanza time, I have got you covered, baby. I don't celebrate Kwanza. Really? You should. It's fun. I love the people here. And if there was one thing I don't really care for, is that they can be terribly, terribly ignorant about other cultures. And I don't want them embarrassing me in front of my girlfriend, Carole. Diwali is a very important holiday for the Hindus. But frankly, I'm a little appalled that none of you know very much about Indian culture. So, without further ado, Kelly, you are on! Diwali is awesome and there's food and there's gonna be dancing, and I got the raddest outfit. Kelly? It has sparkles Why don't you tell us a little bit about the origins of the holiday? Oh, I don't know. It's really old, I think. How many gods do you have? Like hundreds, I think, maybe more. I don't know. And that blue, busty gal, what's her story? She looks like Pam from the neck down. Pam wishes. Kelly, I'll take this one. Diwali is a celebration of the coronation of the God-king Rama after his epic battle with Ravana, the demon-king of Lanka. It symbolizes the battle All right between good and evil  all right. This isn't Lord of the Rings. Here we are. I'm sorry. I started biking to work. Josh does it and he lives a lot farther away than I do. And also it saves gas money, keeps me in shape, helps the environment and now I know it makes me really sweaty for work. Nice basket. Thank you. Now a lot of people say that Kelly is one in a million and that's true, but it's also not true, because frankly, there are literally billions of people just like Kelly in the world. Here are some famous Indians. Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar. He is a Nobel Prize-winning physicist. Impressive. Apu from The Simpsons. Hilarious Indian. M. Night Shyamalan, The Village, Unbreakable, Sixth Sense "I see dead people. " Okay. Spoiler alert. He was dead the whole time. Just stop it. What's Oh, what? Where did that come from? Karen, my chips got stuck in the vending machine again. I need your skinny little arms. Oh. Did you shake it? Yeah, I shook it, I shook it. We have such a roller-coaster thing, Karen and I. Excuse me? Roller-coastery friendship. Hot and cold, on again, off again, sexual tension-filled type of deal. It's very Sam and Diane. Wow. Yeah? From Cheers. Yeah. And another thing about the Indian people, they love sex positions. I present to you the Kama Sutra. I mean, look at that. Who has seen that before? I have, that's Union of the Monkey. Oh, that's what they call it. This is the best meeting we have ever had. Thank you, Kevin. You know, I find this incredibly offensive. Well, I find it beautiful. Well, whatever Kelly wants to do in her own house is fine, but we shouldn't all be subjected to it. No. Actually, she's right. This is inappropriate. Why don't I take these? No, you're not going to collect them. Yeah. No, this is a delightful, charming culture. My Indian cultural seminar was going great until Toby decided he was too immature to deal with culturally explicit images. It's just sex, people, everybody does it. I'm doing it with Carole probably tonight. All right, I think you guys should be all set. Oh, here's the corporate card for dinner. Thanks. Now, Karen, let's keep it to $20 a person this time. Got it. Okay. Once a quarter, the sales staff of this branch has to stay late to do order form consolidation which, amazingly, is even less interesting than it sounds. You guys ready to party? What's that? I said, "Are you ready to party!" Isn't this fun? Not wearing shoes? I wish some of us still had our shoes on. Stop it. It's a disease. I told you. I thought you said this was a costume party. What does that look like to you? An Indian woman in a sari. No one's even gonna notice. Nice outfit. Hey, Kevin. It's a costume. So you can just cool it, okay? Carole? Carole I'll have one of those as well. Thank you very much. Thank you. Now these are limes, lemons, onions I'm a vegetarian. What can I eat? It's all vegetarian. I'll just have some bread. You used your hands. Oh, yuck, oh What, is it too spicy? No. These s'mores are disgusting. They're not s'mores, they're samosas. Do you think they have any s'mores? All they are is chocolate, graham cracker and marshmallow. How difficult would that have been? So, you're Kelly's sisters, huh? What? Rupa, Neepa, Tiffany, stop acting like such little losers and just be cool! Come on, Ryan. Come on. Leave him alone! I hate you guys. They said something about Zach Braff Don't even listen to them No, you know Very official. I decided to come. I feel a little underdressed, but at least I'm not dressed like a slutty cheerleader, right? Is that mean? Temp! Temp! I don't even want to hear it, okay? Stop it. Stop it right now. I didn't come to Diwali to get yelled at. Ryan is a temporary worker. Makes no money. Vali is a whole doctor, so handsome. Makes good money Do you think I want to date a doctor? and he's a perfect match. Hey, Big Tuna, you ready? Yep. One, two, three, shot! Oh, holy mother of God Oh, that burns! Golly That's good Wow! Thirty years. And you two only met once before the wedding night? Yes. Wow. How long have you been married to the cheerleader? She's not a cheerleader! She thought this was a costume party. No, we're not married yet. She is very fair. She is very fair. Very fair and very kind. So, tell me, is your marriage the kind of thing where when you die, she has to throw herself on a fire? No, okay. It's still very cool. Okay, thanks. One, two, three, shot! Are you okay? I'm gonna be. Hi. I'm just gonna Just for a sec. Just a sec. Everyone? I'm sorry. Could I have your attention, please? Thank you. Hi. Sorry, I just have an announcement to make. Okay. I have learned a lot about Indian culture tonight, but I have learned even more about love. And I know you're all thinking, "Who is this crazy gringo and what is he talking about?" Well, I'm not crazy. Maybe I'm crazy in love. So, without further ado, Carole Carol Stills, I would like you to do me the honor of making me your husband. Oh, Michael What do you say? Can we talk about this in private? I didn't hear you? Can we talk about this in private? Oh, you gotta be kidding. Okay. No, I get it. I get it. You're not ready. We'll wait. This is our ninth date, Michael. Well, yeah. But I I feel like I've known you many lifetimes. Maybe I'm Hindu after all. Okay, I'm not Hindu, but Carole, Carole, I just I feel like I just like you so much. I'd better go. Okay? You can find a way home, all right? Yes. Okay. Okay. Okay. Good night. Good night. Hey, you know what? Why don't I come with you? 'Cause I've got this book called the Kama Sutra Okay, good night, Michael. All right. Good night. Well, I was a temp, but I got promoted. So the compensation is a lot more competitive. So you're saving money now Yes to start a family and home? Oh, or travel? And buy an Xbox. Is there anything you wanted to ask us tonight? Can you believe that my boss proposed to his girlfriend in public? That is so Michael. Is it? He's really outgoing, huh? Yeah. Hey, would you excuse me for a second? It's hot in there. How's the naan? Dry. You look like you were having fun. I am. You should come dance with us. I have to watch our shoes so they don't get stolen. Who were you texting? No one. I went to the doctor I went to the mountains I looked to the children Andy, no a cappella. I looked to the children I drank from the fountain There's more than one answer to these questions Pointing me in a crooked line Wait. The less I seek my source Oh, come on, guys, please. The closer I am to fine The closer I am to fine That's not good. Tuna! Are you kidding me? Oh, my God. Wow. That's so spicy. Here. Yeah. You're waiting for a call? No. Wow. Pam, when Carole said, "No," tonight, I think I finally realized how you must be feeling. We're both the victims of broken engagements. Well, you were never really engaged. I was in that marriage arena, though. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, well. I kind of thought something would happen tonight, too. So alike. So alike. What are you doing? What are you doing? I'm rejecting your kiss. I What? I didn't Can I have a ride home? If you sit in the back. Night, guys. Hey, can I have a ride, man? I have my bike. No way, dude. I am not driving home. I brought an inflatable bed for just such occasions. You're welcome to share it, though. It's a roomy twin. I'm good. Hey, dummy, get in the car. I'm a drunk driver. Yes, you are. Here, let me take that thing. Just get in the car. Okay. You can really hold your liquor, though, really. Yeah. You can't. Okay. And I am just going to lie down in the back, if that's all right? Sure. Here's your bag. Just don't puke on anything. You okay? So good. Good. These are not my shoes. This is just like that show Taxicab Confessions If you say one more word, I'm stopping the car. Sorry. This is going out to Indians everywhere. It's a tribute to one of the greats, Mr. Adam Sandler. Diwali is a festival of lights Let me tell you something Tonight has been one crazy night So put on your saris It's time to celebrate Diwali Everybody looks so jolly but it's not Christmas, it's Diwali The goddess of destruction, Kali stopped by to celebrate Diwali Don't invite any zombies to a celebration of Diwali Along Came Polly to have some fun at Diwali If you're Indian and you love to party have a happy, happy, happy happy Diwali! Happy Diwali!   Hey. Hey. Who are you faxing so early in the morning? Kind of hard to explain. I don't have a ton of contact with the Scranton branch. But before I left, I took a box of Dwight's stationery. So from time to time, I send Dwight faxes from himself from the future. "Dwight, at 8:00 a. m. Today someone poisons the coffee. "Do not drink the coffee. More instructions will follow. "Cordially, Future Dwight. " No! You'll thank me later. There she is. Jan Levinson first thing in the morning. Michael. Love to start my day with a hearty bowl of Jan! Michael. Just call me Levinson in the morning, baby Michael. Yes. I'm here to tell you that we are closing the Scranton branch. I don't understand. The Board voted last night to close your branch. On whom's authority? The Board's. What? I'm very sorry. I don't relish telling you this. You've been a big part of this company, and the Board asked me to thank you for your years of service. You're welcome. A small number of people will be transferred to the Stamford branch and the rest will be getting severance packages. Am I a "small number" person or a "severance package" person? Well, we haven't made final decisions about personnel yet. But you're a "severance package" person. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! No! What are they talking about? I don't know. Is it serious? I don't know, Kev. If you find out anything, call me. You got it, buddy. Are you all right, Michael? Do you want me to get you some No, no, no. A water or a tissue? All right. All right. You know what, I don't get it. I don't I don't get it, because our numbers aren't that bad, things are looking up. It's not all about numbers, Michael. Well It's about talent. Oh, you gotta Josh? Our CFO believes that Josh Josh. is going to play an important role in our company's future. Oh, really. What role is that? King of the stupid universe? Okay. Don't do this, Jan. I think we're finished and I need to go. We are not I would appreciate it if you would please use discretion until we get our ducks in a row. I know you're mad, but don't do this to me. I know I hurt you, but please do not do this to me. Don't hurt me like I hurt you. Jan. Jan. It is an outrage. That's all. It's They are making a huge, huge mistake. Let's see Josh replace these people. Let's see Josh find another Stanley. Do you think Stanleys grow on trees? Well, they don't. There is no Stanley tree. Do you think the world is crawling with Phyllises? Show me that farm. With Phyllises and Kevins sprouting up all over the place ripe for the plucking. Show me that farm. Pictures. Memories. Look at that. They grow up so fast. Hey, stranger. Don't say that. That just sounds weird. Please. Sorry, I just feel like we haven't talked in a while. Well, we have nothing to talk about, Dwight. Just do your work. While you still can. When you become close with someone, you develop a kind of sixth sense. You can read their moods like a book. And right now, the title of Michael's book is Something Weird is Going On: What Did Jan Say? The Michael Scott Story. By Michael Scott with Dwight Schrute. Hey, did you hear about your friends in Pennsylvania? Rumor has it that the Scranton branch is Really? Wow, that's bad. Sorry. Scranton branch is closing? In your face. Well, I work here now. Sucker. Are you okay? Yeah, great, amazing. Best physical condition of my life. What did Jan want? Nothing. Just checking in. I can't tell you, so What can't you tell me? Nothing, Pam. What difference does it make? We'll all be gone in a few weeks anyway. What? What? You just said that we're gonna be gone? Do I have any messages? Michael, what's going on? I don't know. What did Jan say to you? Was she mean to you? Nothing. No, she Okay. Okay. Listen up, everybody, I have some news. All I can do right now is put on a brave face and go out there and be their leader. It's over. We are screwed. Dunder Mifflin Scranton is being shut down. Michael, we shouldn't be talking about this until all the decisions have been made. You knew about this all along, didn't you? Jan told me just a few minutes before she told you. Traitor. You are a traitor. What about us, Michael? Do we still have jobs? I don't know. Probably not. This is the worst! So this has been great! So let's get back to work and do the best job that we can. Toby, I'd like to see you in my office, please. All right. Oh, my God. You walk so slowly. It makes perfect sense that it would happen today. Because I just received this in the mail. A thousand business cards with this address and phone number. I don't want to blame anyone in particular. I think everyone's to blame. If I get to stay and Ryan is laid off, I will kill myself. Like Romeo + Juliet. The Claire Danes one. Stamford, Connecticut! Stamford, Connecticut! What happened? I think the word got out about Scranton. Hey, do you know any more details on that? Like, is Am I transferring here? You know, nothing's definite. In fact, you know what Excuse me, everyone. I know there are some rumors going around, but nothing is definite. All right? You guys have done a great job getting our numbers up around here. But until this thing is official, let's just keep working, huh? You know, be professional. Ladies and gentlemen, our fearless leader, Josh Porter! Josh, take a bow. Take a bow! I think it would be kind of weird if everyone from Scranton came here. It'd be like going to your high school reunion and you saying, "Hey, I missed you guys. " And then they're all like, "Oh, don't worry about it. "We're all going to move in with you "forever. " Yeah. Hey. Meredith, hello. Tough day? Yes. So, listen, I know you're seeing someone, but I'm still willing if you are. What willing? You remember. Like six years ago we said that on our last day of work that we would sleep together. God. I did not say that. Was that not you? No. Not me. Never mind. The day just gets worse and worse. It's a blessing in disguise. Actually, not even in disguise. In my fantasy, I always thought I would slap someone, make a big speech and storm out forever. But this is good, too. You're kidding? No. What does that mean? Well, some of us are fired, and a few are going to Connecticut. Do you guys know who's going where? Don't worry. You're going to be fine, Roy. You're very strong and capable. Thanks. Oh, grow up. I don't want to work here without Pam. It'll just be like loading trucks without any meaning, you know. I couldn't be happier. I'm gonna take the severance and retire. My wife and I are gonna travel. I really couldn't be happier. Feeling nostalgic? Yeah, nostalgic. Hey, Mike. Darryl. Noble Darryl. Look, I heard about the office. Tough break. I know, I know. Well, I'll land on my feet. Yeah. Don't worry about me. I wasn't. So you'll be okay, too. You're a warrior, you're smart, capable. You'll find something else and Actually, Bob Vance bought out the warehouse. So he's keeping on the whole crew, so we're good. Awesome. This is my house. The CFO's taking away my house and giving it to Josh. And Josh is giving the garage to Bob Vance. All right. Listen up. Some of you may have heard some rumors about the branch closing. Like when you said the branch was closing? But I am not going to take this lying down. I have a plan, and I am going to save our jobs, so just hang in there. Let's go. Yes! Oh, good, you're bringing Dwight. Yes. This might get ugly and we need backup. What's the plan? We go to New York, confront the CFO. Show him he's making a mistake, save the branch. Can I drive? No way. Shotgun! No, there's no one else. Still Thank you very much. Okay, secretary says Wallace is away for the day and won't be coming back into the office. Okay. Okay. But do not worry. I have his home address right here. Why? Christmas card list. You send him cards? You've never met him. But when I do, we'll have something to talk about. Hey, do you have a second? Sure, what's up? I know it's not definite or whatever, but do you know who's coming over here from Scranton? I honestly don't I don't know. Okay, so is it like Sales or accountants or You know what, Jim? I wouldn't worry about it. What does that mean? Hi! Jan, hey. Oh, good, you're both here. Ready to talk logistics? I just feel like it could have been something special if we could have kept working together, but I'm gonna go someplace else, and you're gonna go someplace else. It just doesn't make sense. This kind of worked out perfectly for me. I got some good experience, Michael's gonna write me a great recommendation. And as far as me and Kelly goes, I think it's for the best. Okay! This is it! This is exactly what Michael Moore does. Famous documentarian. He goes up to people with a camera and he's like, "Why did you do this? Why did you pollute? "You are bad, you're a bad person. " It's very dramatic. Although I can't say I was a big fan of Bowling for Columbine. Because I thought it was gonna be a bowling movie, like Kingpin. And it wasn't. It was something else. So Josh will be running what is now called Dunder Mifflin Northeast, which is all the offices north of Stamford. And, Jim, if you want the job, you'll be his number two. Wow! Sure, absolutely. Awesome. Excuse me, Jan, I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to stop you there. I will not be taking the job. What Excuse me Why not? As of today, I have accepted a senior management position at Staples. Today? You leveraged your new position with us into another offer? Damn it, Josh, this whole restructuring thing was based around keeping you. I I'm sorry, all right. It's done. It's done. I gotta make some calls. Excuse me, I'm sorry, Jim. Say what you will about Michael Scott, but he would never do that. Okay. All visible points of access are covered. So, do you know what you're going to say when he shows up? I will improvise. I will speak from the heart. No. Bad idea. You need an attack plan. Here, I'll be him, you be you. Let's practice. Okay. All right. Coming home from work. Excuse me! Mr. Wallace? David Wallace? Yes. What is the meaning of this? Can you tell us why you are shutting down Scranton and putting 15 people out of work? Well, the branch is no longer financially viable. It's simple dollars and cents. Yes, but these are employees, sir. These are human beings. Listen, Scott. It's no longer financially viable. We're losing money, okay? It's not a charity, it's a business. And it's a dying business. Look, the whole business model of the small, regional paper company simply doesn't make sense anymore. Stop. Stop it, just Okay, he's not gonna say any of that. Well, hey, why not? Because he'd be intimidated, and I just Let's start again. Just be more scared of me, okay? Don't touch me this time. Excuse me, Mr. Wallace? Coming home from work. Pam, would you please sign my company directory. Are you serious? Sure. "Kelly. Best wishes. Love, Pam. " "P.S. "What a long, strange trip it's been. " So, we are still scrambling here, but it looks like Scranton is going to absorb Stamford. Wow. And I know that you just left there a couple months ago, but we would like to offer you the number two position at that branch. Thank you. Yeah. No, it's just I'm not sure if I Well, to be quite honest with you, Jan, I have a few unpleasant memories of Scranton and Michael. No! No, no, just some personal stuff. And I'm not really ready to revisit that, I don't think. Well, please think about it. And call me, we will do whatever we can to get you to stay. Okay. Hey, Meredith, how're you holding up? I'm fine. Hey, did we ever have a conversation about doing something on the last day of work? Does that ring a bell? No. I don't think so. Do you remember hearing a rumor about me and anybody, last day of work Something sexual? No. Okay. I'm kind of okay with it, actually. Oh, that's good. That's great. Do you know what you're going to do then? Well, you know, I've got art school. Oh, that's Yeah, of course. You should totally do that. That's a great idea. Yeah. I am. Already. I started a while ago. Wow, that's terrific. That's awesome. Well, cool. I'm glad you're doing that. You can learn a great deal about a man from his trash. Case in point. Satellite TV bill. Lesson learned? He's rich. Coffee grounds. Was he enjoying a delicious, hot beverage? Or disguising the scent of cocaine from drug-sniffing dogs? It's a nice house. Hey, guys, I'm trying to organize a little group lunch for everybody since, you know, we're never gonna see each other again. Where are we going? I thought maybe Dee Jay's? How about Cugino's? I don't want to go all the way to Dunmore. How about Cooper's, then? No seafood. But I don't wanna go to Dee Jay's. Oh, now all of a sudden you get picky? Okay. Forget it. Hooters. No. $400 for the CPU. Done. Here, replenish your fluids. Where's Michael? He's not here. I don't know where he is. Wait What's going on here? We know the branch is closing. Michael told us. Oh, God. Okay. You know what, everybody? I'm sure there's a better way to do this, but I've driven something like 400 miles today, and I'm completely exhausted, so I'm just gonna tell you. Your branch is not closing. Stamford is closing. For the time being, it seems that all of your jobs are safe. Yes. Yes! Stanley! Is it because of Michael? Did he actually do something? Well, reasons are not important. Would you just call him, please, wherever he is and tell him. Sure. Jan, do you know, is anyone coming back to Scranton? Back? Coming to Scranton. Is anyone coming to Scranton? You know, we don't know. Probably a few. Maybe we should take a break, get some food. Negative. We could miss him. I'm really hungry. Yeah, me, too. Who is it? The office. Are you gonna get it? No, not until I have some good news for them. Not until I have some good news. Dunder Mifflin Action News. Jim Halpert, will Big Tuna be transferring to Scranton? I don't know. Jan offered me the job, but I haven't really decided yet. Yeah. Well, even if I don't get transferred, I'll probably be fine. Cornell has an extensive alumni network, so We look out for each other. I'll probably go back and teach or something. Where'd you go to college? Cornell. That's good. I guess some new people might be coming from Stamford. Which should be fun. New blood. Is Jim coming back? That's I hadn't thought about it. I don't know. I just don't want it to be weird, you know. I mean, I took his old job and his old desk. Yeah, you know, that might be weird. Overall, though, we still all have our jobs, so good news, right? Oh, yeah, totally. I am so happy we don't have to break up now, Ryan! It is the best day of my whole life! I don't know. I can't explain it. What are you gonna do? I really don't know. How you doing with all this? You know, I'm fine. I'll be better when I know if I have a job. You'd actually move to Scranton? Yeah, if they let me, I think I would. New York City is 45 minutes down the road from here. And you wanna move to Scranton. I don't know, if I were you, I'd move to New York. Yeah, you know, I might do that. I might Who knows? I might do that. God! Hey, Andy! What's up, Josh? I just wanted to say thanks, good luck. Thanks, man, you, too, totally. Oh, well. What can you do? It was nice to have those few hours when I thought it was over. Now, I have something to look forward to. Hey, Creed. Congratulations. Thank you. I made like 1,200 bucks. Meredith Palmer. Hey, gorgeous. Who's this? Gary Trundell from the old days who worked in the warehouse. Oh, hey. Hey, gal, listen. I heard through the grapevine that your branch is closing. That got me to thinking about our deal. Remember? Oh, yes. Well, actually, the branch is Can you be at my place in 20 minutes? Yes, I can. Anything? Nothing. What if this doesn't work? What if the office actually goes under? Then it was an honor to have worked with you. All right. Favorite moments in Dunder Mifflin history. Go. My first day when you hazed me by spraying me with the fire extinguisher. That was hilarious. The foam. My first sale. My promotion to assistant regional manager. Our basketball game. And when you took me to the hospital and told me that you cared about me. All right, okay, that's enough, that's good. What were your favorite moments? All of them. I loved them all. Every single one of them. What about when Jan said the branch was closing? God, Dwight. Well, it Hey, Pam, we're going to Poor Richard's. Creed's buying shots. No thanks, guys. All right. Have fun, though. Cool. Hey, I hear Jim's coming back. Really? Where'd you hear that? Hey, Ryan, you coming? Well, I was Yeah, we'll meet you there. Awesome. Let's go, Phyll. I'll tell you later. Okay. Hey. Bye. Crazy day, huh? Yeah. Yeah. Man. I'm really glad you're still gonna be working here. Yeah, me, too. I mean, it'd be a pain to have to find another job, so Yeah, totally. All right, I'll see you. Okay. I was expecting a severance, some time off. But maybe this is good. Finding another job is a pain. There's another annoying boss, another desk. I'd have to learn everything all over again. So, there are reasons to stay. Hey, I think I am gonna take that job. And Scranton, it's not that bad. So, if they offer you a job there, I think you should take it. Okay, yeah, maybe I will. Okay. Yeah, I'm happy he said that. I mean, I don't think he's into me or anything, but I'm kind of into him, so there you go. What are we still doing here? It's over. Let's go home. Get the car. Oh, this was such a stupid idea. This was so stupid. I am such a stupid idiot. I let everybody down. Everybody hates me. I lost everybody's jobs! Nobody likes me anymore! Oh, my God! What? Stamford is closed! Michael, we're not closed! Stamford is closed! Stamford is closed! Is it? We did it! We did it! We did it! You did it! We did it! We did it! Yeah! We did it! Right here! Right here! Yeah, baby! In your face! We did it. Oh, man! How did we do it? I don't know. I have no idea. I don't understand. Well, for a minute there, I saw myself selling my house, moving to Costa Rica, learning how to surf. But Costa Rica will still be there when I'm 65. The Stamford branch is closing, and everybody's just packing up their stuff. Andy Bernard made these tasteful hats. That's the other thing you have to watch out Yo, Tuna. I wanna talk to you about this new boss, Michael Scott. Yeah? So what's he like? Likes, dislikes, favorite sports, favorite movies, favorite men's magazines. You know what? I think you just need to meet him. Playing your cards close to the vest. I get it. Good luck over there, Tuna. Cross me and I will destroy you. Sounds good, Andy. This is gonna be an adventure. Yes, this is going to be very interesting. All right, I'm out of here. See you later? Bro. Hey, is that Josh's computer? What? Hey! Hey! How'd the run go? Pretty good. I finished. That's great. Yes. Why is that great? Because he accomplished something. What was your mile time? About seven. I could beat that on a skateboard. Well, that has wheels. Yeah, well, my feet don't, and I can still crush that time. Really, Dwight? How fast are you? Let's just put it this way. Last weekend, I outran a black pepper snake. Really? I am fast. To give you a reference point, I'm somewhere between a snake and a mongoose. And a panther. Man, what is taking Toby so long? Oh, I'll just time him later. And you'll compare the times? Yeah. Are you ready? Set, go! No, my groin's really tight, I can't Am I being mean to Dwight? I don't know. I did just make him run around the building, and I have no intention of timing him. This isn't even a stopwatch. It's a digital thermometer. He does make my life harder sometimes, and on purpose. Like, he tried to put meters on the bathroom stalls as a way of bringing in more money for the company. Hey, three more laps to go! You gotta pick it up if you're gonna beat Toby! I should probably get back to work. Here. Who's here? Nametag? Yes, please. Karen Filippelli. Karen Karen a-Filippelli! Probably Italian. Possibly Filipina. Okay My branch is absorbing the Stamford branch. Or as I like to put it, my family is doubling in size. And that's all I'm gonna say about it, because I have a gigantic performance ahead of me, and I have to get into my head and focus. Who's next? That's Andy Bernard. Andy Bernard. If I were you St. Bernard. I would fire Anthony Gardner What? before noon I'm not to consolidate power. I'm not firing somebody on the first day. No, no, not somebody. Gardner! The Japanese camp guards of World War II always chose one man to kill whenever a batch of new prisoners arrived. I always wondered how they chose the man who was to die. I think I would have been good at choosing the person. Good morning! Got the food, good! Looky, looky, looky. What I want you to do Set it up in the conference room, please. Make it look nice, as if you were trying to impress a much older man who's way out of your league. Okay. Yes, I'm in a good mood today. I'm excited to meet all of the new people and to see my old friend again, definitely. That's always a thing that makes people happy, to have an old friend back. Hello? Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding. Our first arrival. Welcome to Scranton. This is Hannah Smoterich-Barr! Hannah Smoterich-Barr! Welcome to our humble abode. Follow me to your desk. Your ball-and-chain is right over here.

Wait, are you a robot or a Martian? I am actually your boss, Michael Scott. Hi. Welcome. Wow, you are very exotic-looking. Was your dad a GI, or I'll be the number-two guy here in Scranton in six weeks. How? Name repetition, personality mirroring, and never breaking off a handshake. I'm always thinking one step ahead, like a carpenter that makes stairs. Hello. You must be Andy Bernard. Aloha and welcome! And you must be Michael Scott. Aloha and hello. Very good. Welcome to our little kingdom. We have a bag of nifty gifties for you. Well, Michael, thank you for welcoming me to your little kingdom. Mike. Nifty! They are nifty! They're nifty gifties. You know who I really like is this guy Andy Bernard. He has got this very likeable way about him. which is why they need a passing game. Right? No way! Get him out of here. We don't want any of this kind in here. Good to see you, man! Wow, okay! How are you? Martin Nash, I presume? This is a little gift bag for you free of charge. Follow me, I will show you where all the slaves work. Not So your desk is Hi, I'm Jim. I'm new here. Oh, my God, it's really you! I was just doing a little joke there about how we'd never met. I know, I don't care. Awesome! Good to be back. The place looks really good. It's really good to see you. You, too. Where do I stand with Pam? No idea. I mean, we're friends. Always have been friends. That is where we stand. Well, well, well. Look what the cat dragged in from Stamford. Hey, Dwight. Fact. I am older. I am wiser. Do not mess with me. Okay, sounds good. What are you doing? I don't know what you're talking about. Do I have a smudge on my forehead? No, you look good. Why are you looking at my forehead? I'm not. Meet my eye line, Jim! I am. Stop acting like an idiot! Okay. Hey, buddy. Welcome back. Hey. How are you, man? Good to see you. I'm good. How are you? So Oh, I'm sorry, are you sitting here now? Yeah. Unless you really, really want it back. You know, man, it's really your call. Cool, thank you. Let me get that for you. Got it? This one taken? No? Good. Yeah, Jim is a nice guy. That's why I got the desk. Michael Scott, thank you. I appreciate it, Mike. All right. Hello. I don't believe we've been introduced. Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager. Andy Bernard, Regional Director in Charge of Sales. So you'll be reporting to me, then. On the contrary. My title has "manager" in it. And I'm a director. Which, on a film set, is the highest title there is. Do you know anything about film? I know everything about film. I've seen over 240 of them. Congratulations. Hey, Toby. Hey, Jim. How are you, man? Oh, really good! I just wanted to say hi. How are you? Hey, welcome back. Oh, is that, like, your new thing, or No, I'm sorry, that's No, that's cool. No, it's nothing, we'll just All right. Good to be back. So Okay. All right. All right. Sorry about that. No problem. It was What? Nothing. "I present the orientation video. " We need to talk. Not now. Which is higher, Assistant Regional Manager, or Regional Director in Charge of Sales? I told you the titles are irrelevant. They just relate to pay scale. Okay, so who gets paid more, me or Andy? It is not a matter of more or less. Your pay is just different, okay? All right! Showtime, part one. Okay, who reports to who? I don't care, Dwight! You all report to me. That's all that matters! The rest of it just work out amongst yourselves, okay? And then if I want Work it out amongst yourselves, please! I have a company to run. Will you let me run the company? I One Will you? Please? Jim! Kelly! Oh, my God, I have so much to tell you! Really? Yes. Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes, they had a baby and they named it Suri, and then Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, they had a baby, too, and they named it Shiloh. And both babies are amazing! Great. What's new with you? I just told you. Okay, everybody settled in? Good. Why don't we all proceed into the conference room, or should I say the banquet hall? For Drum roll, please. The official Merger Day All-Family Welcome Breakfast. Come on in! Don't be shy. Hey, champagne. No, no, guests only. Smoked salmon! No, for the guests it is, for you, consider it cow meat. Strictly taboo. I eat beef. Well, then, consider it poisoned beef. It's no touchee. The beef is poisoned? No, it's not beef! Just Sit down, please. Welcome, help yourself. You might want these orientation materials. Wrong, Toby, this is an orientation, not a bore-ientation. Okay, do not worry. All of your questions are about to be answered. Cell phones and pagers off, please. Oh, this looks promising. You won't be disappointed. Let's face it, moving to a new job can be very stressful, so I have made an orientation video especially for you newcomers. But it's not like any orientation video that any of you have ever seen. It's funny. It's got a little bit of a zing to it. And I hope that it gives you a flavor of what we're all about here at Dunder Mifflin, and what we're all about here in Scranton. So let's just all laugh together. And watch Sittin' in my office With a plate of grilled bacon Call my man Dwight Just to see what was shakin'! Yo, Mike, our town is dope and pretty So check out how we live In the Electric City! They call it Scranton! What? The Electric City! Scranton! What? The Electric City! Call Poison Control if you're bit by a spider! But check that it's covered By your healthcare provider! It reminds me of the orientation video Michael showed on my first day, The Scranton Witch Project. I am so scared when people don't label their personal food. You like coalmines and you wanna see 'em? Well, check it out, yo the Anthracite Museum Plenty of space in the parkin' lot! But the little cars go in the compact spot! Spot! Spot! Spot! Well, so far, I think it is killing. I thought it would either be an A or an A-plus, but I completely forgot that there is an A-plus-plus. What? This is Karen Filippelli, please leave a message. Terrible. Totally unconvincing. This is Karen Filippelli, please leave a message. Not bad. But you are Italian, so try it more Italian. This is Karen a-Filippelli, please leave-a me the message. You feel good? All right. Karen Filippelli. Hey, buddy. Anything new to report? Do you mean, to me from you? 'Cause that's how it works. Sure thing, buddy. Am I trying to get under his skin? Yes. Because the angrier he gets, the more marginalized he becomes. Meanwhile, Andy Bernard is out there laying on the charm. Hey, Angela. Check this out. It's my new screensaver. Do you like it? I do like it, actually. Thank you. You have such a pretty smile, by the way. Thank you. You're welcome. Hey. Hey. What happened to grape soda? Oh, yeah, I'm trying to move away from that. Getting into more of a bottled water phase. You've changed so much. Well, I'm evolving, Pam. So when do I get to hear everything? Are you still getting unpacked, or You wanna grab a coffee or something after work? Tonight, actually? No, I'm just still getting settled, so Oh, yeah, no, you know, whenever. Okay. Okay. Sorry to interrupt, I Nope, you're not interrupting anything. Nope, I'm Don't. All right. Okay. All right. I should probably get back to work. Crack the whip. All right. Yeah, I know, me, too. The day's going fine. It's been a little chaotic, but it's fine. It's great. A lot of distractions, but it's good. Take a picture, it'll last longer. I'm sorry, it's just It's a little distracting. Ditto that, my brother. Look what's on his computer! What is that, a squid's eye, or It's my left breast. How did you Right place at the right time. Oh, what's that smell? What smell? There must be an air freshener plugged in somewhere. It smells like a funeral home. Oh, I'll help you find it. You know what, never mind. What is it? I think I'm just allergic to your perfume. My perfume? It's just my crazy nose. I'm used to different smells. Bob Vance bought this perfume for me in metropolitan Orlando. It's made from real pine. Who's Bob Vance? You've a lot to learn about this town, sweetie. I don't know who these new people think they are. I've sat downwind of Phyllis' stinky perfumes for years. Never said a word. People hate people that are different from them. That's natural. But you know what makes people forget their differences? A great show. That is why I created the integration celebration. This is the moment when Scranton and Stamford come together as one, united in applause. I know a lot of you must be thinking, "Wow, what a day. "It feels more like a night at a party than a day at work. " Well, in my opinion, business should feel like a night out, a night at the Roxbury. Okay, there's supposed to be music, and it's I got it, I got it, Dwight! Just Do you have batteries in there? Stupid What is love? That's it! Yes, yes! Okay. Here we go. Baby don't hurt me Don't hurt me no more Don't hurt me no more Let it rock, baby! What is love? Baby don't hurt me Here we go, here we go! Don't hurt me no more Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me. You and me! You and me! Me and you! You and me! You and me! You! You! You! You! You and me! You! You! Oh, my nose is so itchy. Why is my nose so itchy? Probably because of all the nose candy. Okay. I told you these guys had a sense of humor. Very funny, Michael! Okay. Really funny, Michael! All right, all right, all right, I'm on a roll. Why are the new people on the table? To show them that we are not above them. Shouldn't we be equals? Not today, no. Tony! Please join your cohorts on the table, if you would. This is difficult for me. Hey, I understand, we're all friends. No, I mean, I can't physically. I can't get on the table. Oh, well Just use the momentum of your lower half to hoist yourself up. Okay? You know what? I'll help. I will help. No, please. Don't Don't be shy. Dwight, let's do this. Come on, we're doing this thing. Ready? On three. One Let's get up. Bend at the knees. Okay. Here we go! Here we go! I'm under this. I'm under this hock here. I don't know what I'm grabbing here! All right, all right! Stop! Put me down! But it feels good. Push it, push it! I'm right in your crack! No, put me down right now! Don't give up! You got it, man! Put me down right now! I've had enough! Put me down right now! You got it, you got it! Wait, wait, wait, okay, okay, okay. Easy. Hey, easy. I'm sorry! Don't It's just not going to work for me. I have to go. I don't understand. I was on the fence about this, and it's just not a good fit. Well, we'll squeeze you in! I can't work here. I have to quit. You can't quit on the first day! That's heresy, my friend! Okay, let's talk about this. What happened? I mean, what Was it Toby? Did he say something? 'Cause he's No, Toby was helpful. He was very kind. It's just your management style. My management style? So Didn't you think Lazy Scranton was funny? No. Was it supposed to be funny? Okay, well Don't bother quitting, because you're fired. Excuse me? You are fired! I'm sorry, but we don't have quitters on this team! Just clean out your desk! But there's nothing in my desk except coupons. Don't try to apologize to me, man. It's too late! Just get out! Take your bad vibes with you! That was my advice. Remember, I'm the one who suggested that you fire him! Probably the best advice you ever gave me, Dwight. And what advice has Andy given to you today that you have acted on? Would none be an accurate estimate? None advice? Fire Andy. Fire Andy. Dwight may have won the battle, but I will win the next battle. Tony was right. This environment is dysfunctional. Well, maybe that's because some people treat it like their own private Hooters strip club. Whoa, Angela, hold on. Hooters is a restaurant with over 400 locations worldwide. Back to work. We don't have to get along. We just have to work together. No, we do have to get along. Can't we all just get along? Or have we forgotten the words of the Reverend King? The word "merger" comes from the word "marriage" and that was what today was supposed to be. The loving union between people. Instead, it has become like when my mom moved in with Jeff. And once again, it becomes my job to fix it. Hey, hey, everybody! Something happened! Those guys from Vance Refrigeration, they let the air out of our tires! What? Yeah, they punk'd us, they punk'd us good! Come on! Come on! Does Bob Vance work for Vance Refrigeration? Does he ever. Man, they got us so bad. We cannot let them get away with this! We have got to pull together as one and steal their refrigerators! Yeah! Yeah? I don't think we can do that. Go home, Toby. Just Hey. Why doesn't your car have a flat tire? Why? I will tell you why. Because they saved the worst for me! They put a hate note under my windshield wiper. Check this out, it's so hateful. "You guys suck! "You can never pull together as one and revenge us! "That is why you suck!" For crying out loud. No. No, no, no, no! No, you are falling for it! You are playing right into their hands. This is just what they want you to do! Don't, okay. What is with this guy? Got an hour? I'll try to explain. This is egregious! This is egregious! Trust me, it only gets worse. Is he always like this? Sometimes he brings more costumes. When do people work? We find little times during the day. How are we gonna get home? Bob Vance has an air pump. He said he'd fill all our tires up. Bob Vance of Vance Refrigeration. See that? Mission accomplished. They're like a bunch of fourth graders. Sometimes what brings the kids together is hating the lunch lady. Although, that'll change! Because by the end of the fourth grade, the lunch lady was actually the person I hung out with the most. Jell-O. Hi, Jan. Michael! Did you fire Tony Gardner when he was trying to quit? I did. Major personnel crisis averted. Compliment accepted. Do you realize, Michael, that we now have to pay him severance? Yes. You do? But do you realize that that was actually Dwight's idea? Bad advice from my number two. What? No, no, no, Jim is your number two. What? He is the only one who has worked with both groups. I sent you a memo about this. Yes, I know that, for I do read the memos. So, after a great deal of thought and introspectivtion, I have decided to make Jim my new number two. If he even wants it. It doesn't come with a pay raise. No, it does, actually. So who will be your new number three? That I have not decided yet. Michael, I would just like to say that you have handled this entire situation with great aplomb. Thank you, Andy, that's very kind, thanks. And I have to say that your leadership has brought Shut it. Shut it. That's Suck-up. Hey, where you at, Filippelli? I'm at the grocery store buying a corkscrew to give myself a lobotomy. What's wrong, you didn't have a good first day? Oh, my God! Hey, you wanna meet at Cooper's in an hour? I need a drink. Yeah, sure. Sounds good. I Hey, you know what? Can I give you a call right back? Yeah. Bye. Okay, thanks. Hey. Hey! I thought you had already left. No, I just had some other stuff I had to do. Good. What's up? Oh, nothing, I just feel bad. I feel like things were a little weird today, or something. What do you mean? I just think I should tell you that I've sort of started seeing someone. And That's totally cool. You can do whatever you want. Okay, good. We're friends. We'll always be friends. Right. It's good to have you back. Yeah, good to be back. Saw your dork-mobile in the parking lot. What does it get, like, four miles to the gallon? Try double that. Classic Trans Am, vintage American muscle. Please. Yeah, my Xterra is pretty sweet. Luxurious yet rugged. Leave it to the Japanese. Xterra's not even a real word. Actually, it is, it's Latin for "earth. " Oh, so you drive an X-earth? Yeah, that makes sense. I'd rather drive a classic Trans Am than an X-earth. Yeah, I bet you would. Oh, by the way, 1985 called. It wants its car back. Well, I hope 1985 has a time machine, 'cause I drive an '87. Speaking of time machines? I just got back from the future, and I went to your funeral, and guess what? Nobody came. Speaking of funerals, why don't you go ahead and go die? That was a really well-constructed sentence. You should be an English professor at Cor-Not University. Idiot! If I were an idiot, I'd be driving a Trans Am. If you were driving a Trans Am, you'd be the smartest idiot in the whole world. Idiot! You're the idiot. Nice comeback. I was making fun of your comeback. That's why it worked. I totally got the best of that interchange. Oh, she's absolutely adorable. He. Oh, sorry. He's He's dressed all in pink. That's his favorite color. Oh, that's fun for him. Fantastic. Oh, wow, look at that. How cute. Thank you. Oh, may I? Oh, sure. Hey, look at me! I'm a baby. I'm one of those babies from Look Who's Talking. What am I thinking? Look at all those staplers. What's a stapler? I don't even know. I'm a baby. Hey, Mom! I'm thirsty! I'm thirsty, Mama! I want some milk! And you know where milk comes from? Breasts. Hey. Hey. Almost done? Just about. Yeah. Now. Yes, I have started to see Karen. It's very new and Not really ready to talk about it openly yet just because I think, once the word gets out there, it might affect the way people behave around us or I don't know. Just not yet. Yeah, Jan, it looks like a check, a piece of paper of some sort. Receipt. I don't know. Jan, this is Angela Martin from Accounting. We have a rebate from the Federal Work Opportunity Program and no one knows what that means. We get that money for hiring an ex-convict. I didn't hire an ex-convict, unless they mean Toby. Convicted rapist. I'm just kidding. When did the check come? Last week. Okay, that's when the branches merged. So Josh must have been taking advantage of this program. Smart move. One of the Stamford people is a criminal? Hey, Jan, speaking of Stamford, Hannah brought in her baby. Jan, which one of the new employees is a criminal? A reformed convict, and I'm not sure so hang on, let me e-mail our H.R. Stay on the line. Who is it? Hannah? Andy? Andy? Martin? Oh, you are such a racist. Wait, why am I a racist? Because you think he's black. He is black, right, and He was the last one Stop it, stop it right Just stop it right now! Okay, it's someone named Martin Nash. Yeah! Michael? Why did the convict have to be a black guy? It is such a stereotype. I just wish that Josh had made a more progressive choice, like a white guy who went to prison for polluting a black guy's lake. I wonder what he did. In our society a black man can be arrested for almost anything. He was probably at a sporting event and saw some people pushing each other and he intervened. Why would anyone go to jail for that? So what we need to do is to forget about this whole Martin-in-prison thing. People will draw unfair conclusions about Martin andlor black people. Cool. Okay. Angela? Sure. Let's protect the convicts at the expense of the general feeling of safety in the workplace. As a 90-pound female that sits in an ill-lit, rarely-visited corner of the office, naturally, I agree with that. Good. All right. Jim Halpert. I am so horny. Okay, I can't help you with that. Oh, I think you can, Big Tuna. Tell me about that Indian chick, Kelly. She seems pretty slutty, good for a romp in the sack. She is dating Ryan, I think. Oh, and I care, why? She's high-maintenance. Next. How about Angela? Blondes are more fun. Come on, trust me on that. Yeah, trust me. That would be fun for no one. Okay, fine. Okay. Pam, the receptionist. Pam, should I go for it? Absolutely, you should. Jackpot. Just try to be cool. I am cool. Okay. Are you cool, really? I'm cool. I'm cool. I'm so cool. Tell me what is going on. Martin from Stamford was at one time in prison. No! Be cool, be cool! I am greatly concerned about having a convict in the office. And I do not care if that convict is white, black, Asian, German or some kind of halfsy. I do not like criminals. Oh, God! All righty, let's get started. What is she into? I know Pam pretty well. I know the things that she likes, and just as important, I know the things that she hates. So one of the things that she likes is pranks and the things that she hates Frisbee-based competitions. Are you kidding? She I started the main Frisbee Golf Club at Cornell where I went to college. I live to frolf. Lead off with that. Okay She loves hunting. She also loves those ads for Six Flags with the old guy. Got it. Also, do you speak pig Latin? Hey, Martin. How's it going? Good. Getting settled. Ah, good, good. Good. Just a second. Hey, everybody, may I have your attention, please? I realize that a lot of you have already heard that Martin, here, has had some trouble with the law. But I just want to declare publicly that I trust him completely and that anybody who doesn't is an ignorant, dumb person, okay? As a matter of fact, you show me a white man you trust and I will show you a black man that I trust even more. Pam, tell me a white person you trust. My dad. Danny Glover. Yeah. Jonas Salk. Who? Justin Timberlake? Oh, please. Colin Powell. Hey, I've got one. Yeah. Jesus. Apollo Creed. Close your eyes. Picture a convict. What's he wearing? Nothing special. Baseball cap on backward, baggy pants. He says something ordinary like, "Yo, that's shizzle. " Okay, now slowly open your eyes again. Who are you picturing? A black man? Wrong. That was a white woman. Surprised? Well, shame on you. So, you all wanna know what I was in for? No, that's not cool. You don't have to tell them. I really don't mind. It was stupid mistake. I was working in finance and I got involved in some insider trading. So, I spent a little time in the clink. That is awesome. I had Martin explain to me three times what he got arrested for because it sounds an awful lot like what I do here every day. What was prison like? Not terrible. Boring. We do the same thing every day. But at least we get outdoors time. You got outdoors time? Two hours, every day. Sometimes we'd play pick-up football games Michael, why don't we get outdoors time? Yeah, some days I never go outside. Well, we are running a business. What was your cell like? Not good. It's a little bit bigger than Michael's office, but, you know, I really only slept there, you know? During the day our time's our own. They had classes. I took some watercolor classes. They have art classes? Yeah. Did they have business classes there? They did, taught by some Harvard Business School guys. A lot of the guys also that were in the class, the inmates, a lot of them have gone on to do extraordinary things in business. Terrible things It kinda sounds like prison's better than Dunder Mifflin. Well, that's not true. I would so rather be in prison. Yeah. Prison sounds great. No, you would not. This place is not prison. This place It's way better than prison. Baby. Hello, baby. Here, you want to play with this? You can't give paper clips to a baby. He could swallow them. It's okay. I've got tons of them. You like that? Pam-a-lama-ding-dong. Listen, you're cute. There is no getting around it. So, I don't know if you like country music, but I was thinking maybe one of these days we could drive out to a field, crank up some tunes, smoke a few Macanudos, maybe even toss a disc around. Ut-way ooh-day ooh-yay ink-thay, am-Pay? Wow. I Shh. Think about it. I'll hit you back. Wow. That was Wow. Okay! Listen up, everybody! You guys said that prison was better than this place. And I heard you loud and clear. So, I am instituting some changes to make this more like prison. We are going to start with an hour of outdoor time. So let's go! Michael, it's freezing out. I can't feel my toes. Why don't we pump some iron? Anybody wanna pump up? What is that, like, five pounds? It's two-and-a-half. I'm not going for bulk, I'm going for tone. I'm going back inside. Yeah, it is freaking cold out here. Anybody wants to stay out, you've got about 27 minutes of rec time. Oh, hey, man. Hey. Did you have TV in the joint? Yeah, in the rec room. Like a 10-inch black and white? Actually, our TV was bigger than that one. These people don't realize how lucky they are. This office is the American dream and they would rather be in the hole. Oh, Andy. I thought of one last tack you could take with Pam. Yeah? What? Quick question. Do you play the guitar? I play the banjo. Hold on, let me think about that. Yes, that'll work. But can you sing in a sexy, high falsetto voice? You know I can, my man! Yep, that's perfect. Hey. Hey. Maybe I'll get my banjo out of my car. Perfect. What is going on? I'm messing with Andy. I'm sending him to all the women in the office with just terrible information on how to get them to go out with him. I love it. I want in. Who's the target? Oh, you know what? It was gonna be Pam Perfect. But But what do I do? Just give me an assignment. Oh, you know what, though? I feel like I already sicced him on Pam. We'll give her a break. Let's think of someone else. All right, everybody, there has been a lot of name-calling against our office today, corporate maligning, slurring, much of it coming from one of you, who claims that prison is better than here. And none of us can say, "Boo," because none of us have ever been to prison. Well, there's somebody I'd like you to meet. Somebody else who has been to prison, who can tell you what it is really like. I'm Prison Mike! You know why they call me Prison Mike? Do you really expect us to believe you're somebody else? Do you really expect me to not push you up against the wall, biatch? Whoa, whoa, whoa Hey, pass All right. Yay, yay, yay, yay. That's just the way we talk in the clink. Been a lot of fun talk about prison today, but I am here to scare you straight. I am here to scare you straight! In prison you are somebody's bitch. Oh, and you. You, my friend, would be the belle of the ball. Don't drop the soap. Don't drop the soap. Michael, please. Where did you learn all of this? Internet. So, not prison. And prison. It's 50-50. Both. Look, prison stinks, is what I'm saying. It's not like you can go home and recharge your batteries and come back in the morning and be with your friends, having fun in the office. What did you do, Prison Mike? I stole and I robbed and I kidnapped the President's son and held him for ransom. That is quite the rap sheet, Prison Mike. And I never got caught, neither. Well, you were in prison, but Prison Mike, what was the food like in prison? Gruel sandwiches. Gruel omelets. Nothing but gruel. Plus, you can eat your own hair. Wow. Prison sounds horrible. Yeah, yeah. Well, thank you, Andy. Thanks. Prison Mike, what's the very, very worst thing about prison? Don't encourage him, Dwight. The worst thing about prison was the Dementors. They were flying all over the place and they were scary and then they'd come down and they'd suck the soul out of your body and it hurt! Dementors like in Harry Potter? No, not Harry Potter. There are no movies in prison. This is my point. You guys got it soft and cushy. This place is freaking awesome! The people are awesome. Your boss is nice. Everybody seems to get along. People are tolerant. People who would jump to conclusions can redeem themselves. Nobody is nobody's bitch. I hope that this scared you, and from me, Prison Mike to you, I just wanna thank you for listening to me and letting me be a part of your life today. 'Cause you got a good life! You got a good life, a good life. So what do you think? It doesn't sound so great, does it? Wow. Thank you. That must have been hard for you to relive that. Both of you. Yeah, that wasn't really at all my experience. There's certain elements of what you performed I've seen on television, but it didn't remind me of my time in prison. Okay. Okay, fine. You guys think prison is so great. All right. Well, here you go. Okay, Michael, come on, let us out. No! If you think prison is so wonderful, then enjoy prison. Are we gonna They are such babies. I am going to leave them in there until they can appreciate what it's like to have freedom. And if this doesn't bother them, then I am out of ideas. Hey, let us out of here. Hey! I have Shh. This is Toby. Hey, Pam. Where're you calling from? Michael, why is everyone locked in the conference room? They were very disrespectful to me and to the office and Martin has had a bad influence. To think that I gave him the benefit of the doubt. It's Well, you're gonna have to let them out, or I will, okay? You know what, Toby? I am teaching them a lesson, so You know they're teasing you. I mean, obviously this is a much nicer place than an actual prison. We get paid to be here. We go home afterwards and have social lives. And we have parties here. They're teasing you to be funny. Okay, nutcases, get out of there. Good work. Long day. Really long. Why don't you guys head home early. Time off for good behavior! Good job. Enjoy your freedoms. Martin went from being a new guy from Stamford to the convict, to my friend, back to a convict, then to kind of a nuisance, actually, if we could be completely honest, and finally, to a quitter. And I will not miss him. And that is not because he is black. So we've been told and some choose to believe it But I know they're wrong wait and see 'Cause one day we'll find it The ainbow-ray anection-cay The lovers, the dreamers and me!   Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas No! Why did you bring that here? Don't worry, she's dead. Oh, wait. He's dead. Dwight? What I accidentally ran over it. It's a Christmas miracle. Well, get it out of here. Relax, okay? And because this is Christmas, I am going to roast this goose and prepare it with a wild rice dressing. Do we have any cayenne pepper in the kitchen? Merry Christmas, Dwight. Jim. Wow. What do we got here? What does it look like? Dead goose. And circle gets the square. All right. So, can you watch this? I'm gonna get my carving knife out of the trunk. Oh, Dwight, we talked about this. No, Toby, this is different. He's already dead. Once I brought in a duck to prepare for lunch, and people got upset. Apparently they got attached to the duck and didn't want to see it killed. He was already dead, and we Schrutes use every part of the goose. The meat has a delicious, smoky, rich flavor. Plus, you can use the molten goose grease, and save it in the refrigerator, thus saving you a trip to the store for a can of expensive goose grease. Wow. Win-win. Exactly. Thank you, Jim. I like goose. And it's already dead. Is it so crazy if we eat it? That's crazy. It's crazy. Dwight, you cannot keep that here. Okay, that is ridiculous, and totally against the spirit of Christmas. Come on, Dwight, we went over this, like, for half an hour. It's Christmas, Toby. It's a dead animal in our office. You can't Toby I'm sorry. Please. Please. Clean it in your car. I would like it off my desk. Oh, Pam, take a chill pill. Deck the halls with boughs of holly Fa, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la 'Tis Hey! I would like a nice slice of Christmas Pam. Side of candied Pams. And perhaps, some Pam chops Can I help you, Michael? with mint. I'm looking for the Toy Drive box. It's behind you. Okay. Well, I need to put this bike in there. I hope it will fit, with all these little knick-knacks. Wow. What kind of bike is that? I don't know. Average kind. The tires look pretty worn. Well, that is probably from the test drive. But the paint's chipping. Is that your old bike, Michael? No. Yo, Michael. Sweet ride, Mike. Oh, thanks. Yes? Michael? Oh, Pam, that is so sweet. You didn't have to do that. I didn't. It's from corporate. Okay. Did everybody get one of these? Yep. Terrific. Good. This is going to be the best Christmas ever. My girlfriend, Carole, is coming to our party tonight and I have a little surprise for her. I've got two tickets to paradise Pack your bags We're leaving day after tomorrow I'm taking her to Sandals, Jamaica, all-inclusive. All-inclusive. You know what that means, right? Yeah! I think you're supposed to put a toy in the box, Creed. And a happy holiday to you. Carole. Hi. Is Michael around here? There she is! A Christmas Carole. Hello. You're about five hours early to the party. Oh, you're such a blonde. Michael Hey, everybody? I don't know who you haven't met yet, but I think this is one of them. This is my girlfriend, Carole. This is just the front of her. Show them the other side. What? Turn around. Turn around. Come on. Get out of here! No, you get out of here. Michael? Yes. If I may say, she's even prettier than you described her. Oh, ouch! Michael, I don't think there's anything wrong with the way you described her. Thank you. I really need a moment alone with you. Not as much as I need a moment alone with you. What is this? That is my Christmas card. It's a picture of you and me and your kids on a ski trip, having a blast. "Ski-eason's Greetings. " No. See, we never went on a ski trip. I know. I know. I went on a ski trip Right. two years ago with my kids and my ex-husband. Yes, but what you didn't realize at the time was that I was with you, in a sense. I was in your heart Michael  and next to your kids. What? This is so weird. I don't understand. It's a bold move to Photoshop yourself into a picture with your girlfriend and her kids on a ski trip with their real father. But then again, Michael's a bold guy. Is "bold" the right word? I think you're a really sweet guy. Okay. But I don't know how to deal with this thing, and the proposal, and I don't think things are gonna work out with us. No. No, no, no, no, no. Okay. Okay. You know what? You're not thinking straight. You know what you need? You need to think this through in "Jamaica's largest freshwater pool!" What are you talking about? I got us tickets to Sandals, Jamaica. We leave day after tomorrow. You had better find the skimpiest bikini there is. Michael And it's all-inclusive. Michael Yes. I'm sorry. No Carole? You walk out that door and it is over. I know. Jim? Hey. Hey. I need to give you your Christmas gift now, because Well, I'll just tell you. What? For the past few months, I've been sending Dwight letters from the CIA. Are you serious? They're considering him for a top-secret mission. There's his application. Oh, and this is where I made him list every secret he promised he'd never, ever tell. "Last year, my boss, Michael Scott, took a day off "because he said he had pneumonia, "but, really, he was leaving early to go to magic camp. " Wow. So, here's the gift. You get to decide what his top-secret mission is. Sorry I didn't wrap it. You know what? I really don't think I should be doing this stuff anymore, though. No, just because of the promotion. Oh, yeah. Just feels a little bit like No, I get it. Of course. Okay. I feel like there's a chance for me to start over. And if I fall back into the same kind of things I used to do, then what am I doing? I'd like everybody's attention. Christmas is canceled. You can't cancel a holiday. Keep it up, Stanley, and you'll lose New Year's. What does that mean? Jim, take New Year's away from Stanley. Michael, what's going on? Carole and I split up. Amicably. And I just don't think it would be appropriate to celebrate under the circumstances. Will they still air Rudolph? That's not fair! Are we going to cancel Hanukkah as well? Fine! Have your party. Just no guests. But we invited guests. Well, you know what, Phyllis? All of your guests would have probably canceled at the last minute anyway, leaving your life a stupid, rotten mess. So. Okay. It hurts. I know. It hurts my heart. It hurts my stomach. It hurts my arms. Okay, well, why are you laying like that? Thanks. How did you push away the bad thoughts? Like what? Like maybe, the real reason they left was because there were things they wanted you to do in bed that were What foreign and scary? I I don't really And not that you didn't want to try them. Some wine might have helped. Do you know what I'm referring to? I don't need to know. Michael? Yeah? Sorry to interrupt. It appears we're one bathrobe short. Take it from Toby. Copy. Pam, would you like to go to Sandals, Jamaica with me? It's all Okay. No, thank you. Hey, Dwight. Pretty nice robes. I Why? Phyllis, I need you to pick up green streamers at lunch. I thought you said green was whorish. No. Orange is whorish. So, I had a couple of ideas to make the Stamford people feel more at home. Each year we have a Christmas raffle Okay. It would never work here. Okay. Another idea was karaoke. No. A Christmas drinking game. Yes! God help you. What? These are all terrible ideas. And none of them are on the theme of a Nutcracker Christmas. I think you should leave. You're kidding. You tried this out, and it's clearly not for you. It's time to go. Come on. Please? Thank you. Okay. Thank you very much. You touched my heart you touched my soul You changed my life and all my goals I know you well I know your smell What are you doing? We're getting rid of everything that reminds you of Carole. Hey, what's the haps? Carole? Oh, look at this. Your old condo closing papers. It's riddled with Carole's name. I wish I could throw this in the box. You have been the one for me Why don't you just buy the whole song? I don't have to buy it. I just want to taste it. I just want I just want a little taste of it. Look at this, she saved you $2,000 because they failed to report a mold problem. But wouldn't that affect the final How did she Oh, I see what she did. That is good. Wow. That Carole is one smart cookie. Goodbye my lover, goodbye my friend You have been the one You have been the one for me You touched my heart, you touched my soul This is an old adage. But they say that when you find true love, you know within the first 24 hours. With Carole, I knew within the first 24 minutes of the second day I met her. I feel like I've been kind of cold to Karen. And there's no real reason for it. I mean, it's not like she's ever done anything to me. So, I think I probably shouldn't be cold to her. Hey, Karen, sorry about that meeting today. That was really crazy. Yeah, right? I'm so glad you said that. Because I don't know how those meetings usually go. Usually like that. Does anyone ever stand up to Angela? Or I think one of her cats did once. She came in with scratches all over her face. Right. I really liked your karaoke idea. Oh, cool, yeah. That could really be fun. You guys do a raffle? Thank you. Yeah, we do a raffle. Hey, Kev. Hey. This should have been up yesterday. It'll be all right. What is that? "The Committee to Plan Parties invites you "to a Margarita - Karaoke-Christmas"? There's no such thing as the Committee to Plan Parties! There is now. We just started it. Well, you can't just start a committee. You have to have funding. What's your funding? Two hundred dollars. What's ours again? Two hundred and one dollars. Right. Hey, a margarita-karaoke- Christmas party. That sounds like fun. No. That is not a party. There is only one party, and it's hosted by the Party Planning Committee, and it starts at 3:00. Then why are there two flyers? I understand that this is confusing for everyone. Let me explain. There's a party that starts at 3:00 Right. and then there's a way more fun party that starts at 2:45. Right, and if you're interested in the way-more-fun party, all the info can be found here, on our more brightly colored flyer. I didn't see where it was. Yep, looks like the Scranton people and the Stamford people are finally coming together. And that's what you want, right? I think that's really Pam and Karen, I am ordering you to cease and desist all party planning immediately. You can't do that. As ranking number three in this office, I am order I'm number three. You're number four. Yeah, but I'm number three. No. You must turn over to me all Christmas decorations and party paraphernalia immediately. They will be returned to you on January 4. Okay, I think I can help here. Okay, good. As ranking number two, I am starting a committee to determine the validity of the two committees, and I am the sole member. The committee will act on this now. Okay, this is stupid. Could you please keep it down? I'm in session. I have determined that this committee is valid. What? No! Yeah! No! Wait! Wait, wait, wait. Permission to join the Validity Committee. Permission denied. Damn it. Hey. I can't concentrate when I know you're in pain, man. Let me take you to lunch. Come on! My treat. All right. Nothing here to distract myself with anyway. That's my boy. I know the perfect place, too. Hooters? No. Benihana. Much classier. But don't worry, the babes are totally hot, too. I need my entourage. Jim! Dwight! Ryan. Come on. We're going to Asian Hooters. Oh, man, I can't. Why not? I'm not feeling so well. I got a ton of work to do here. MSG allergy, peanut allergy. I just ate there last night. All right. Feel better. Thanks. Come on, Jim, let's go. Okay. Wow! Thanks for taking all the excuses, dude. Doctor appointment. Car trouble. Planter warts. Granddad fought in World War II. Use your head, man. I keep mine in here. Look alive, Halpert. Welcome back. Bros before hos. Why? Because your bros are always there for you. They have got your back after your ho rips your heart out for no good reason. And you were nothing but great to your ho, and you told her that she was the only ho for you, and that she was better than all the other hos in the world. And then Then suddenly she's not your ho no mo'! So she looks really hot, so I said, "You look hotter than usual today. " Thank you. Michael? Head of the table. May I? Actually, sir, I'm going to need to take this chair, so Dwight, just leave him. Leave them alone, please. They are on a date. They look very happy. So she looks at me, right, and she goes, "I'm sorry. Do I even know you?" After a year! A year of buying lattes from her. Do you believe that? Yes. I can't hear what you're saying. Carole used to drink lattes. Who're you talking about? She would get this little foam mustache Carole had a mustache? and I used to say, "Hey, got latte?" And she'd say, "That's not funny. " What are you guys talking about? She totally got me. She understood that we didn't have to laugh Michael? to enjoy each other. Michael. What? Repeat what you said louder! It is my job to be there for Michael. How can I be there for Michael if I'm here for Michael? I'm already starting to forget what color eyes she had. I can't Okay, I'm gonna call her. I am going to call and find out No! Who are you calling? Put it away. Put that away. I'm going to call her. SOS! We Hi. Mayday! Man down over here. We need your help. What can I get for you? I think we'll start with a round of Nagasakis. One part eggnog, three parts sake. Some places won't make it for you, though, because eggnog is seasonal. You should put out salt for the rims. That's a great idea. Phyllis? I was just getting a snack. You can have your snack in here. Pam, don't tell her what to do. Phyllis? Okay. I think I'll go to Angela's party, because that's the party I know. I miss the days when there was only one party I didn't want to go to. So, I only use three? If you're using more than three pieces of tape to wrap a present, you're doing it wrong. Okay. And where'd you get all those cool bows? Oh, I just get those at any party supply place. Okay. Are you sure I can't use, like, the cartoons from the newspaper? Oh, yeah, your mom will love that. Hey. Hey. All right, I'll see you guys later. Bye. He's cute. You should date him. Yeah, maybe. Looks like you got a little Nakiri knife action going there. No, is Usuba. Yeah, I bet you wish you had a Nakiri, though. Actually, the Usuba is the better knife when you working with this quantity. I don't know. Still think Nakiri's better. I think he'd know. Nothing he's doing is cheering me up. Wait for the onion. Trust me. Hey, Cindy, he just had his heart broken. You wouldn't do that to him, would you? I don't know. Sure you would! Look at you. I bet you break up with a guy every hour. You made her laugh! Yes! She totally digs us. Watch. Watch. Watch. What did I tell you? You're right. That's good. Hello, everyone. We would just like to announce that our party is starting now in the break room. So I have a very important announcement to make about your paychecks. Your paychecks will be arriving, as scheduled, on Friday. And they will be in the correct amount that they normally are in.

In fact, it will be starting right now. Our party is also starting now. Yeah. All right, Stanley! Good choice! Welcome, Hannah! You will not be disappointed! Why would I be disappointed? I said you wouldn't be disappointed. Meredith, if you don't come to my party, you will be very, very sorry. That a threat? No, it's an invitation. We have vodka! Lots of it. I hear Angela's party will have double-fudge brownies. It will also have Angela. So double-fudge, Angela. Double-fudge, Angela. Brownies. Cupcakes. Don't push it. Are we taking this too far? You know what, I don't think we're taking this far enough. What? I got goosebumps. I don't back down. My sister and I used to be best friends, and we haven't talked in 16 years over some disagreement I don't even remember. So Yeah, I'm pretty good. Mmm. Damn, this chicken is good! My compliments to the chef, which is you! Right? Awesome! I need some meat. I want some steak. That guy's got steak. I see steak! Excuse me. Excuse me. En garde! It's family style. No. It's not.

Hold its neck back, insert the knife beneath the jaw, bring it all the way around. There's gonna be a good amount of blood. But don't let that bother you. Have a bucket there for the blood, and the innards, and the feathers. Oh, no, this is different. The CIA thing, that was a prank on Dwight. This is more like a Okay. It's pretty much the same thing. What do you think? Fruity, and delicious. See, I told you. You want one, Meredith? No, thanks. They're too sweet. Hey, so, what's the status? It looks like they forgot the power cord. What?

Tell you what, if you want it, it's yours. Thanks! I wanna give you something. Oh! That's what she said. Hello! I would like everybody to meet my new girlfriend. And my new girlfriend.

I guess I didn't know her very well. I marked her arm. You what? I put a mark on her arm so I could tell them apart. I don't I know. I know. I can't believe I gave her my bike. Yeah. Why do I feel like crap? You just had a rebound. I had a rebound. Yeah. Which, don't get me wrong, can be a really fun distraction.

Well, I guess I didn't really score, and I'm not sure who is actually shooting, but Whatever! Doesn't matter. It's all good. Or, as my ex might say, "Domo arigato, Mr. Scotto!" Little baby Pa rum pum pum pum I am a poor boy, too Pa rum pum pum pum I have no gift to bring Pa rum pum pum pum That's fit to give a king Pa rum pum pum pum Yeah. Yes, I just wanted to see if you would like to come to Jamaica with me. There's this resort called Sandals. Really? Okay. All right. I promise you won't be disappointed. It's all-inclusive. Shall I play for you? Pa rum pum pum pum Too soon. I played my drum for Him Pa rum pum pum pum I played my best for Him Pa rum pum pum pum Rum pum pum pum Rum pum pum pum Night, Pam. Night. Oh, you know what? Sorry, I forgot to tell you. I intercepted a transmission earlier, and it seems that the CIA is gonna need Dwight down in their headquarters at Langley for training and an ice cream social with the other agents. We should get him a bus ticket to make his trip easier. Oh, no, that would be great. We should try. It costs $75. Well, maybe the CIA could send a helicopter. "You have been compromised. Abort mission. Destroy phone. " "Destroy phone. "   All right, let's get started. Oh, first off, we're supposed to be pushing card stock this week. So, let's push card stock this week. Also What is this? Tape recorder. For what? For recording. Michael is on vacation and he has asked me to record all meetings and to type up the transcripts. Okay. Karen, any news from that law firm? Yeah, the deal closed yesterday. It's a six-month commitment. Oh, my God! Dwight, what are you doing? What? You're not allowed to take off your pants in the middle of the office. I'm not. Dwight, you know what, just back off, okay? That's making me uncomfortable. This is sexual harassment, by the way. Oh, my God, he's got a knife! I do not have a knife. No. Let the record show that Dwight K. Schrute is now completely nude and is holding a plastic knife to Stanley's neck? Let the record show that Jim Halpert is a liar! Dwight Schrute is now wearing a baby's bonnet. I am not. Oh, Jim Carrey just walked in. Dwight, get his autograph for Michael Jim Carrey did not just walk in, okay? Yes, he Dwight, what is that on your stomach? Is that a Muppet Babies tattoo? Oh, my God, Karen, you're right. That is Animal from the Muppet Babies. You can't see my stomach I am now chopping off Phyllis' head with a chain saw! Hey, mon! Hey. You have a bunch of messages and That's nice. Hannah quit while you were gone. I guess she memoed to file some complaints she had about being a working mother, and so you might also have to be deposed. Relax. Just relax, okay? Okay. I'll get to all of it later. It's kind of serious. Aren't you going to ask me how Jamaica was? Say it. Ask me. How was Jamaica? It was so good! Hey, mon! At Sandals, Jamaica, when somebody says, "Hey, mon," everybody says, "Hey, mon," back. Oh, Michael, I'm glad you're here. Stanley. You know what? It is really good to see you, too. My bonus check was $100 less than you promised. Okay, well, payroll is in charge of all of that They said I should talk to you. Well, I am just getting settled in. So I'm gonna I am not doing a lick more work until I get my full bonus check. You are not as much fun as your Jamaican brothers, mon. You wanna talk about it? Nope. I still haven't found an apartment yet. I'm living in a hotel. Yesterday, I saw a for-rent sign down the street from Jim, and he said he didn't think it'd be such a good idea. He said it would be like we were living together in different houses, two blocks away. Feelin' hot, hot, hot! Feelin' hot, hot, hot! Feelin' hot, hot, hot! Feelin' hot, hot, hot! That's all I know so far, but I'm gonna keep practicing. It's good. You know, I had never been out of the country before now. I got to see how Jamaicans live. It is great. You know, they just relax, they party all the time. It's kind of an impoverished country. Yeah. Gosh. Great. You know what, Pam? Make a note. I want us all to start having piña coladas every day at 3:00. Well, you can't today. We're doing inventory. Inventory's at the end of December. We couldn't do it without you, so we postponed. I specifically went on vacation so I would miss it. Inventory is boring. In the islands, they don't make you do stuff like take inventory. Why do you think so many businesses move to the Caymans? Tonight, we are going to have an inventory luau. I want to bring back a little slice of paradise to the Dunder Mifflin Warehouse Inventory. So, Party Planning Committee, get on it. By the end of the day? That's impossible. The Jamaicans don't have a word for "impossible". Yep, it's English. It's "impossible". Michael, there's no way we can do it in time. How hard is a luau? All you need are some grass skirts, pineapple, poi, tiki torches, suckling pig, some fire dancers. That's all you need. Come on in! Settle in. Settling Settling And settled. Good. There is something I would like to show everybody. See this sign? "No shirt. No shoes. No problem. " This is an attitude I would like all of you to have right here. So what if we have to stay late and do inventory? No problem. Oh, my God. Is that Jan? What? Where? What? On the left. No, no, no. That's Oh, my God No, that's a German woman named Urgle Grue. Jan told me to play it cool and not tell anybody because it could get us both in trouble. So, officially, I did not see her. But I did see Jan there in our room at night and in the morning. And that's all I'm gonna say. Sex. Sex. We had sex. I had sex with her. I had sex with Jan. Hey, dude. I just got back from Jamaica. Big whoop. I was in Hotlanta. That whole town is waxed. Yeah, that sounds amazing, but you know what? The lady, Jan Levinson, wanted to go to Montego Bay. You took The Ice Queen? I don't buy it. Well, I'm looking at a photo, right now, and, I'm telling you, it could be in Maxim. They wouldn't give you a subscription to Maxim. Oh, no? No. Okay. Well, check this out. I'm sending you some e-mail. You got it? What? No, I got nothing. Check it again. Hit refresh. Yeah, Mike, still nothing. Okay, wait a second. I sent it to you at packer@dundermifflin. com Packaging@dundermifflin. com Uh-oh. Wait. I just got it from somebody else. Wow! This is hot. Damn! How do I get you out of this picture? Darryl? Hey. Hi, where's Darryl? He's in the office. Okay. Hi. Hey, man, how's it going? All right. What's up, Mike? That's great. Okay. So did you get an e-mail from me? Yeah. Okay. Well, that was supposed to go to Packer, not Packaging. Did you already forward it to a whole bunch of people? Uh-uh. Okay. Well, did you get the second e-mail that I sent explaining that the first e-mail was a mistake and that you should delete it? Yep. Have you sent that out to everyone? Mike, I'm very busy down here. Yikes. Already sent it to you, my friend. Fantastic. Boring. Call me if she rolls over. Hey. Hey. You okay? Yeah. You sure? Yeah. Yes. I'm just in this, like, stupid fight with Karen. Oh! You want to talk about it? Really? I have a special assignment for you. Who's the target? A sensitive e-mail has been released into the office. It contains a file. A picture. The filename is Jamaica Jan Sun Princess. What's it of? Not important. Unless you're willing to tell me everything, I cannot accept this assignment. Okay, then forget it. Okay, I accept it. So, I don't know, I just feel like we've been dating a month, right? Same street, I think that might be a little close. A little bit much. What? How far away does she live now, like, 10 minutes? Yeah, I guess. Honestly, I think you should go easy on her. No, I didn't mind helping Jim with his problem. That's what friends do. I help Phyllis all the time. Just yesterday, I untangled a piece of tape from her hair. So, yeah. Hey, thanks a lot. Oh, don't worry about it. I mean, it's better than listening to Michael play a conch shell, which is what I was doing. Oh, also, Michael went to Jamaica with Jan Yeah. How have we not talked about this already? I mean, what happened there? Kidnapping? Hey, I need to talk to you Not now, not ever. about you and Jan. None of your business. I wish that were true, but it It It seems from that photo that two of you have entered into an intimate relationship. That photo is my personal property, and if you are telling me that you went on my computer and stole that photo, then I am going to call the cops. Michael, nine different people e - mailed me that photo, including my ex-wife and we don't talk. Well, this is probably the icebreaker you need. You know, for your own protection, you should disclose the relationship to HR. I bet you would love all the details, wouldn't you, you skeevy little perv? All right. If you're having a relationship with your superior, you must disclose it. No, no. No, I am not dating Jan. She was very clear about that. Just two like souls having a romantic time in the most romantic place on Earth. Got enough, weirdo? All right, thanks, Michael. Okay. Okay, we only have three hours, people, to plan a whole luau and you're not helping. What are the ingredients of poi? I've called every grocery store in Scranton and no one sells whole pigs. Did you try the petting zoo? Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Just a second. Michael? It's Jan on the phone. Oh, God! No, no, no. Hang up. Hang up. Tell her I'm not here. Don't Don't I've ran out of gas. I hit a deer. I hit I hit a deer with my car. No. I hit a cat. Tell her I hit a cat. He'll call you back. Okay. Great. Do you think she bought it? Okay. Okay. Michael hit a deer? Michael! Michael, there's an emergency in the warehouse. An accident? Is somebody hurt? No, it's It involves the photograph. Oh, God! No, no, no. Mike, you're a rock star, man! You are the man! Yeah! Well done! All right. Okay. Hit that corporate booty. Nice to hit it! Hello! Hi! Attention, everyone. Apparently, there is an e-mail circulating around that contains a very PG-13 rated picture of me and a woman. Jan. No, Kevin, a woman. Maybe Jan, maybe Urgle Grue. My point is that if you get it, I would ask that you just delete it, sight unseen. Let's be professional, all right? Feelin' Feelin' hot, hot, hot Hey! Hey. What are you doing out here? Island living, you know. Jan called. She's coming in later to talk to you. Did she say what it's about? That's all she said. Olé, olé, olé olé, olé, olé Olé, olé, olé olé, olé, olé The people in the party, hot, hot, hot I think you dropped this. You sure? Definitely. I have disconnected the office T1 line. I have ordered that be taken down. All right. I've destroyed all printouts from the bathroom. There are copies in the bathroom? There were a lot of them. All right. I think I owe you one. Sorry? For talking sense into Halpert. The Days Inn Room 228 was staring to get really depressing. Yeah, I know, don't worry about it. I mean, he was being ridiculous. Yeah. But thanks, seriously. Sure. Okay. Yes! Yes, what'd I tell you? I knew he'd turn up. You see that? This is the greatest night of my life. Who did this to you? Where is he? What? No. It's not It's nothing. It's hot in here. Yeah. Yeah. Thanks. You don't need to stay here. I know. So you're PMSing pretty bad, huh? Hello, everyone. Hello, Michael. Hello. Hi, Jan. You look tan. I was in Scottsdale, visiting my sister. Yeah? How was it? Very sunny. Family's important. Michael. I would like to speak with you in your office, please. Okay. Yep. Why am I here, Michael? I In the last year, I've gone through a divorce, an identity theft, a husband who would not communicate. This is neither here nor there. My psychiatrist thinks that I have some self-destructive tendencies, and that for once, I should indulge them. Are you following me? Yes. I think I owe it to myself to find some kind of happiness, you know? I mean, even Even if it means lowering my expectations or redefining the word itself. Okay, yeah This is the thing, you know? I am attracted to you. I don't I don't know why, I But I am, and I need to follow my instincts. At least, that's what Dr. Perry thinks. Who's Dr. Perry? I This is the point, okay? You're wrong for me. In In every way. But I still Well, I find myself wanting to be with you. And I to you, in addition, feel the same feelings that you are, as well. Good. Good. So, thanks for coming by. Yes I Oh. Good. Okay. Okay. Thank you for taking the time. Well, thanks for coming over. I appreciate Wait 15 minutes, okay? Then find an excuse and meet me at your condo, okay? Okay. Jan? You complete me. Oh, God. Hey. You remember when we were planning our honeymoon, and you wanted to go to Hawaii and I wanted to go to Mexico? Yeah. I was definitely right. Oh, brother. What am I gonna do? I'm gonna hang it up at home. I don't have a lot of art. Angela. What? That was a voicemail that corporate left last night. They did not get our tax forms. Did you send them? They arrived this morning. Are you sure? It is a big deal if Is it a big deal? Is it, Kevin? Do you really not know? Because it is a big deal. Five of us transferred from Stamford. There's two of us left. Me and Karen. It's like we're touring Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory and dropping off one by one. Well, guess what? I'm not falling in a chocolate river. Everything okay? It's fine. You are in the clear. Thank you. I don't want those. Dwight, care to join us? Finally. Thank you. Hey, Dwight, pass the tardy sauce. Get it, Michael? Yes. Okay. Here is the dream team. My sales dream team. Today we are going to team up for sales calls. Andy, since this was your idea, you get to pick first. Well, let me think about this for a minute. Oh, I don't know. Michael Scott? PhD. Doctor of sales. Well, I appreciate that. That's very gracious of you. Well, it is very gracious of you to accept. Well, thank you, sir. Okay, now going by seniority. Phyllis, our resident senior. We're the same age. And I'll pick Karen. Oh, thanks. Good. Next up, the Super Fly himself, Stanley. Pass. You can't pass. You gotta pick somebody. I'll take the kid. I'm very flattered. I was his second choice after pass. So that just leaves Dwight and Jim. Okay, wait. Does anyone want to trade? Yeah, I'll trade. Dwight and I used to go on sales calls all the time. In fact, I have a picture to remember that time. Oh, young Jim. There's just so much I need to warn you about and yet, tragically, I cannot. Sebring by Chrysler. A heck of a motor carriage. Dwight! Yeah? Here you go. Yeah! You want shirts on hangers? Please. He does your laundry? Long story. All right, everybody, circle up! Here we go. You know what this is? This is The Amazing Race. And you guys are retired Marines, and you guys are the mother-daughter, and you guys are the gay couple, and we are the firefighter heroes. Are we ready to go? Wait. Amazing Race, like, the biggest sale wins? No. We're just gonna rush out, do the sales thing and come back. Is there a prize? Just bragging rights. Then how is this Amazing Race? It's just It's Amazing Race, Phyllis, okay? We're in teams of two and we're on a mission. All right. So, on your mark. Get set. Go. Let's do it. Come on! Michael Do you have a pole? Let's go get a broom. Seriously, are you gonna sit in the back? Yeah. It's the safest part of a car. In the event of a crash, the driver always protects his side first. Here we go. In order to take down Dwight, I have to chip away at his ally. In this case, Michael. And here's the good news. Every success I've ever had in my job or with the lady folk has come from my ability to slowly and painfully wear someone down. What's the deal with Dwight doing your laundry? That is a long story. A couple of months ago, Dwight tried to go behind my back with Jan and get my job. And I am now having him do my laundry as punishment. Wow. That is a long story, but quite well told, Michael. I find it very interesting. Especially the part about Dwight going behind your back and basically being, like, a terrible person. You know, if you want your laundry done right, I used to work at Abercrombie, so Pretty good folder. Hey, Pam. Would you like to go with me to grab a coffee? Really? Yeah. I thought you could use some fresh air and it might be fun. Okay. Sure. Okay. Why are we turning in here? This is a beauty salon. Hey, do you mind if I take the lead on this one and then you can critique me after? You want the lead? Yeah, if you don't mind. Mind? Nothing would delight me more. Leave the keys. You still do that thing? Leave the keys. I think that you have assembled an amazing team at Scranton. It's really a pleasure to be a part of it. It's like everyone has their own special skill, you know. Just like the Super Friends. Except for Dwight, who's kind of more of a Super Dud. I mean, he'd be a Super Friend if there was a Super Friend whose super power was always being late. You know? Hawkman. My plan is taking longer than I thought, but I don't give up easily. I have walked two marathons, so Let's go. The men's room was disgusting. After you, sir. No, thank you. I never let anyone walk behind me. Seven out of 10 attacks are from the rear. Okay. Well, that still leaves a 30% chance that I'll attack you from the front. Yeah, but it'll be easier to stop. I can always block the blow. Or I can counter it Angela, you seem so happy. I bet you wish you were like this all the time. This friend of mine Let's call her "Noel. " She missed this deadline turning something into corporate in New York. But then this gallant gentleman, we'll call him "Kurt. " He drove all the way to New York and handed it in for her. That's I don't know. I guess he just really likes her a lot. Well, that's great. Yes, it is. Hello? Hey. Did you catch that up at Lake Wallenpaupack? Yeah. You know, I used to go up there all the time with my step-dad and I never caught anything that big. I caught an 80-pound shark off Montauk. That's in the Hamptons. My dad's got a 42-foot Bayliner. Sniped it with a rifle from the crow's- nest. Also shot a deer once. You know what? Let's get right down to it. Dunder Mifflin may be just two rooms and a warehouse, but what we lack in flash, we will make up for with hard work and decency. Okay, this is the classic undersell. Because you should know we don't work out of a log cabin. We trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Ever heard of it? It's in New York. I have to say I'm a little wary of getting involved with a big company. We've had some problems in the past. And I think what Andy is trying to express is that while we have the resources of a large company, we will give you the care and attention of a small company. Man, that is like poetry. I swear. No. This guy could sell paper to a tree stump. I'm so sorry, man. I really screwed that up. I really No. Don't worry about it. I really Schruted it. What? I Schruted it. It's just this thing people say around your office all the time. Like when you screw something up in a really irreversible way, you Schruted it. I don't know where it comes from, though. You think it comes from Dwight Schrute? I don't know. Who knows how words are formed. Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. This is Pam. I did? Yeah, I did a watercolor of Francis Willard Elementary School for a contest they were having. They were calling with the results. And I won. I won. My painting won! So I'd like to thank my mom for always encouraging me. And I'd like to thank my dad for buying me my first set of art pencils. And I'd like to thank the sixth-grade class that picked me. It's a big order. Thanks, Ken. Yeah, thank you. Hey, how's Annie? She's great. This is us last year in Bermuda. Lovely place. You ever been to Bermuda? Stanley Hudson. Julius, how's it going? Great, great, great. Stanley, so good to see you. You, too. I'd like you fellows to meet Ryan Howard. Hi. Yeah. I'm gonna let Ryan do a little pitch for you while I do my crossword puzzle. Ryan. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hello, Ryan. Hi. What do you have for us? We can offer our biggest discounts on 30% recycled and ultra premium laser. Okay. Okay. Can I use your phone? Yeah, sure. Go ahead. Thanks. Let me talk to you about a few of the other things we can offer. Namely, we know that tax season's coming up, so by April 1st we can have you fully stocked. We have discount prices on ink cartridges. One. Three. And also any forms that you're gonna need Seven.  we can custom make them. Hey, Kev, guess what? I won an art contest today. How much did you win? $100. I won 400 bucks on the Celtics game last night. Cool. Congratulations. Thanks. It was so sweet. And you just said, "Hi! Hi! Hi!" You sounded like my niece. And she's six months old! Well, I appreciate what you guys are saying, but it makes more fiscal sense to go with one of the big guys. Sure. That's true. We can't compete with their prices. But let me ask you something. How important to you is customer service? Very. Please keep holding. Your call is very important to us. That's one of the big guys. Been on hold this whole time. And this is Dunder Mifflin. Dunder Mifflin customer service. This is Kelly. Hey, Kelly, it's Jim. Oh, my God! Jim! How are you? I wanted to tell you Here's my card. It's got my cell number, my pager number, my home number and my other pager number. I never take vacations. I never get sick. And I don't celebrate any major holidays. All right. I get it. We got a deal. All right. Hey, Angela, I got good news today, too. I won an art contest. That's great, Pam. I like having these little moments with you. You know what? Sprinkles recently had kittens. I would like to offer you the dominant male. His name is Ash. I don't think so. But thanks. My building manager is You understand. Well then, have a nice day. Thanks. That was fun. Yeah. I really enjoy spending time with you. You're a very nice person. Thank you. I'm so glad you're with Jim. He was hung-up on Pam for such a long time. I didn't think he'd ever get over her. That's nice. You can pay me back later for the makeover. Hey, boss. Got a minute? Yes, Andy. I forget. Why did Dwight say he was late this morning? He didn't say. That's weird. Because I was just walking past his desk and I saw this, which is a toll booth receipt from New York City, stamped really early this morning. So Why would Dwight go to New York without telling anyone? You think he went to see Jan? That's not like him, is it? Someone told me a story about this With like laundry and betrayal. Did you betray Dwight and try to steal his job or something? No. You are remembering it wrong. Dwight betrayed me once before. So this is his strike two. You know what they say? "Fool me once, strike one. "But fool me twice, "strike three. " Dwight's name is on the security sign-in sheet, but I don't know who he met with. And where it asks to state your business, he wrote, "Beeswax Not Yours Incorporated. " I knew it. Oh, doggie. Hey, you wanna grab a coffee? Sure. Look at you. Yeah. Beesly, coffee? No, thanks, I had some already. All right. But, hey, Jim. Yeah? I won an art contest today. No way! Yeah. All right, Pam. Congratulations. Thanks. Which one was it? I sent them one of my watercolors. Cool. It was a new one I did. Are you ready, Jim? Yeah. Can I see it when I get back? Yeah. Congratulations. Thanks. Big deal. Hey! We nailed the sale. Where were you this morning? I overslept. Damn rooster didn't crow. Why do you lie, liar? I'm not a liar. You are lying right now. Sure seems like he's lying. Stay out of this, you! I know that you went to corporate this morning. And I know that you lied about it. And given our history, I need you to tell me right now exactly what you were doing this morning. Michael, I cannot tell you what I was doing there. But you have to trust me. I would never do anything to hurt you or this company. Okay, you know what? I want you to think about your future at this company. I want you to think about it long and hard. That's what she said. Don't Don't you dare. I want to know what you were doing this morning by the end of the day. It's gonna be okay. How's it gonna be okay, Dwight? Everyone will know our business. Well, that's not the worst thing in the world. I'll just stand up in front of the office and reveal our true love. It won't be that bad. Look at Kelly and Ryan. I hate those two people more than anything in the entire world. Well, I don't have a lot of choices. So, let me ask you a question. Okay. Did you ever have a thing for Pam? Pam? Did I ever have a thing for her? No. Why? Did she say something? I moved here from Connecticut. Yeah. Okay, here's the I had a crush on her before I left. And I told her about it and she didn't feel the same way. So it didn't amount to anything and I left. I'm really glad you're here. Okay? Okay. May I have your attention, please? This will only take a moment of your time. "Although I love this company more than almost anything in the world, "I have decided to step down from my post and spend more time with my family. "I do not fear the unknown. "I will meet my new challenges head on and I will succeed. "And I will laugh in the faces of those who doubt me. "It's been a pleasure working with some of you "and I will not forget those of you soon. "But remember, while today it is me, "we all shall fall. " In other words, I'm quitting, so Oompa, Loompa, doom-pa-dee-dawesome Dwight is now gone, which is totally awesome Why was he gone? He was such a nice guy No, he was not He was a total douche Doompa-dee-doom I would like to give the rest of my belongings to Michael Scott. Just take it. Except this. Good luck. And this one. Dwight will be missed. Not by me so much, but he will be missed. Dwight from sales was one of the most honorable and efficient employees this company has ever had. One of my life goals was to die right here in my desk chair. And today, that dream was shattered. Hey, man. What happened on your sales call? Am I happy about the way things turned out? Oh, "Happy's" such an ugly word, but I saw what needed to be done and I did it and now I'm thrilled. So, it's pretty Hello? Pretty good. I have left Dunder Mifflin after many record-breaking years, and I'm officially on the job market and it's very exciting. For your convenience, I've broken it down into three parts. Professional resume, athletic and special skills resume and Dwight Schrute trivia. I am ready to face any challenges that might be foolish enough to face me. How would I describe myself? Three words. Hardworking, alpha male, jackhammer. Merciless, insatiable. There's nothing on my horizon except everything. Everything is on my horizon. I got this job to make some money while I continue my employment search. And it's fine for the time being. Break's over. Big Turkey? He rocks in the treetop all a day long Hoppin' and a-boppin' and a-singin' the song All the little birds on Is that you singing? All four parts. Recorded it on my computer. Wow. Took me forever. Nice job. Thank you muchly. Oh rockin' robin well you really gonna rock tonight Every little swallow You gonna answer it? Every little bird in the tall oak tree I called it myself. Just thought you'd get a kick out of the new ring. Yikes. Side note, just like to say I'm thrilled to be working directly beneath you. Cool. I feel I have a lot to learn from you, even though you're younger and have less experience. So here's to the future, Andy and the Tuna. Andy and the Tuna Oh, what a duo, magical Andy and the Tuna I miss Dwight. Congratulations, universe, you win. Yes, Dwight Schrute has left the company. More personnel turnover. Cost of doing business. Yeah, well, it is a big loss. Dwight was the top salesman. Was the top salesman. I said "was. " Right, addition by subtraction. What does that even mean? That is impossible. Yeah, you're right. But there is some good news. Oscar is back, addition by addition. So we are going to have a big party today to welcome him back, and hopefully, that'll lift everyone's spirits. Hi, everyone. Oh, hello, Oscar. How was your gaycation? That's very funny. Yeah? I thought of that like two seconds after you left. Hi, Angela. Oscar. Hey, boss. Hey, what's up? Nothing. Man. TGI Wednesday. Am I right? Yep. Gonna go home, get my beer on, get my Lost on. What're you doing later? You wanna hang out? Oh, I don't know, maybe. Well, I'll take that as a maybe. Where're you going? Bathroom. Oh, I'm going to the kitchen, I'll walk with you. Things are going pretty good. Getting a lot of face time with the boss. Oscar, I have a question. Would you like to join the Party Planning Committee? The committee with all the women? Yeah. Because I'm gay? No, no. Certain events have transpired and I've thought about certain things, and I'm sorry for the way those certain events transpired. And I would just like to make some changes about certain things. And certain situations and certain accounts. Okay, okay. All right, all right, I'll join. I'd love to. That's Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Can I join, too? Never. You sell those two printers this morning? Nice work. Child's play. Give me something hard to sell. Wow, what is wrong with this thing? It looks terrible. Do you want me to ask the night cleaning crew if they stopped watering it? Yeah. Oh, you know what? Ask them about the toys on my desk, too. They always used to arrange the toys on my desk in a very pleasing way. It used to brighten my morning. Oh, that wasn't the night crew. That was Dwight. Really? That was very nice of him. We need more attitude like that around this office. Feel you, dawg. Yeah, do you? Absolutely. What did I say? You said Which is like Right on. Pam was like, "Blah, blah, blah," and you're like, "Yeah. " Nailed it. Wow. Love that Andy, right? Solid fellow. Seems smart enough. Likes me a lot. A lot? Too much. Like a crazy person a little. Not super crazy, just There's something about him that creeps me out. I can't really explain it. He's always up in my biznezz, which is Ebonics for being in my face and annoying the bejesus out of me. I don't understand how someone can have so little self-awareness. I really have no preference. We don't even have to have a party. No, hey. Hey, don't be ridiculous. Of course we're going to have a party. The celebration of Oscar. Oscar night. And I wanted to be Oscar specific. Michael No. No, I mean, not because you're gay. Your gayness does not define you. Your Mexicanness is what defines you to me. And I think we should celebrate Oscar's Mexicanity. So, Phyllis, I want you to go find firecrackers and a Chihuahua. Pam, in the frozen food section, Swanson makes a delightful chimichanga. Why don't you have me riding in on a donkey into the office, Michael? Would that be good? A burro. Of course, if Oscar wants a donkey, let's get him one. Need any help? Oh, no, thank you. I'm just looking. Great. I will literally be standing right here if you need anything at all. Think I could go for some tuna fish right about now. Got my rod here. Click, click, click, click. Click, click, click, click. Click, click, click, click. Hey. Hey. Hey, so Andy is in rare form today. Yeah, you should not encourage him. Encourage him? I'm the victim, okay? He's fishing for me. We gotta do something. Look, I've got like 15 new clients that I've inherited from Dwight and each file is password protected with a different mythical creature, so I'm sorry. I can't. Fine. Party pooper. Who's that sportscaster that bit that lady? Mar-something? Andy is like Mar-something. Great sportscaster, big weirdo creep. Hey, guys. How's the workload? All of Dwight's old accounts. Handling it okay? Sort of. He had a lot of clients. Yes, he did. Have any of you talked to Dwight? Oh, sure, we talk all the time. Really? No. Don't do that. It's not nice. What about you, Phyllis? You and Dwight were close. No, sorry. Dwight had a big personality and I have a big personality. And a lot of times when two people like that get together, it can be explosive. Really coming down out there. The commute's gonna be hell. I have snow tires and chains, plus exceptional hand-eye coordination. So, where were you working before this? Dunder Mifflin. What kind of company is that? Paper company. We're only one of Staples' top competitors in the area. I never heard of them. Oh, really? Have you heard of paper? It's gonna be like that, huh? I don't like him, his giant head, or his beady, little eyes. That's all I got to say on the matter. In your head in your head Zombie, Zombie Zombie In your head Would you like to pull a prank on Andy? I'm kind of in the middle Yes, please. Okay, good. Stay right here. Zombie In your head Sorry about that. Oh, smooth move, Tuna. Nice one. Are there any messages? No. So weird. Nice to have Oscar back. Yeah. He rocks in the treetop all a day long Hoppin' and a-boppin' and a-singin' the song Large Tuna, have you seen my cell phone device? No. 'Cause someone is calling right now. There is a call. well you really gonna rock tonight Every little swallow Angela. Is everything okay? No. He rocks in the treetop What's going on? What're you talking about? Where is my freaking phone? Love to hear the robin goin' You know what? Maybe it's in the ceiling. You know what? Maybe you're in the ceiling. Okay. I don't trust you, Phyllis. Every little swallow, every chickadee I wanted to let you know that Dwight was late that morning because he had to drive to New York to drop off the quarterly tax forms that I forgot to send. Why would Dwight do that for you? I think I know why. Because Dwight loves this company. Do you think that anyone else out there would've driven to corporate for you? None of them. Especially not Andy. Oh rockin' robin well you really gonna rock tonight Pam, I have a mission to accomplish. Make sure this party gets rolling and I will be back shortly. Where are you going? Want me to come with? Listen, I forgot to tell you the plan for this Saturday. You, me, bar, beers, buzzed. Wings, shots, drunk. Waitresses, hot. Football, Cornell, Hofstra. Slaughter. Then, quick nap at my place and we hit the tizzown. No. I don't wanna do any of that. Duh. Which is why I was joking about doing it. No, just stop. Stop. Just stop doing it. You're going to drive me crazy. Fine, I'll just go sit at my desk and be quiet. Sorry I annoyed you with my friendship. Excuse me. He rocks in the treetop all a day long And I'm also sorry that a lot of people here for some reason think it's funny to steal someone's personal property and hide it from them. Here's a little news flash. It's not funny! In fact, it's pretty freaking un-funny! Every little swallow, every chickadee God! The wise old owl and the big black crow Flapping them wings That was an overreaction. Gonna hit the break room. Does anybody want anything? Pam, you good? Yeah. Sure? Okay. Well, that question is meaningless. Just go with the copy paper, it's your funeral. See how that works out for you. Hey. Hey. What's up? Same old. It takes a big man to admit his mistake, and I am that big man. Angela from accounting told me what you did. Oh, my God, she told you? Yes, she did. And, Dwight, if you were willing to do something like that for some random co-worker, then clearly, I misjudged you from the beginning. And I apologize. Accepted. How's this place treating you? My boss isn't funny. I don't get to wear my ties. No. Sure. So So maybe you should come back. You should come back. Please. I don't wanna do your laundry anymore. We can talk about that. All right. Oh, my God. That's half-inch dry wall. I think we broke his brain. "It's not freaking funny!" You really enjoying your fiesta? Actually, yeah. I didn't think I would but turns out it's great. Ladies and gentlemen, may I present Mr. Dwight Schrute. Welcome back. Thank you. Okay, Dwight, you can let go of her hand. You're gonna break it. Not bad, huh? You did this for me? Guilty. Hey. Do you still have feelings for her? Yes. And now, ladies and gentlemen, the big finale. Sir, would you do the honor? Oh, man. No, no, no, no. I don't need it. It takes a big man to admit his mistake and that's what I did. The important thing is, I learned something. I don't want somebody sucking up to me because they think I'm going to help their career. I want them sucking up to me because they genuinely love me. So Michael had a little chat with corporate and they decided to send me to management training. Anger management, technically, but still, management material. This whole thing's supposed to take I expect to be done in five. How? Name repetition, personality mirroring and positive reinforcement through nods and smiles. So don't worry about old Andy Bernard. I'll be back. Just like Rambo. Oh, hi, you must be Andy. Oh, hi. Yes, I am, and you must be Marcy. That's right, it's so good to meet you. It's so good to meet you. Thanks. Well, you ready to have some fun? Yeah.

How Would you stop interrupting, please? Yesterday, I was scraping some gunk off my wall sockets with a metal fork and I gave myself the nastiest shock. And when I came to, I had an epiphery. Life is precious. And if I die, I want my son to know the dealio. The dealio of life. Here are some things that I want to teach you that your mother won't be able to. To jump-start a car, first, pop the hood. Then you take these bad boys and clip them anywhere on the engine. Then, you take these and clip them wherever. Number eight, learn how to take off a woman's bra. What We will demonstrate on Pam. No. And No. Come on. You just twist your hand until something breaks. Ow! Well, you get the picture. Thanks, Pam. And remember, no matter what, I will always love you. What if he's a murderer? He's not gonna be a murderer. Maybe that's how you die? You know what, Dwight, do you want to do this or no? I wanna do this. Okay. From the top. Ready? Three Action. Hello, everyone. As you know, we are six days away from Phyllis' wedding. So get your suits to the dry cleaners and get your hair did. And Karen, you might wanna invest in a dress or a skirt of some kind if you don't already have one. This may be Phyllis' only wedding ever. It's my job to insure that none of you look like ragamuffins. So I am instituting prima nocta. Prima nocta, I believe, from the movie Braveheart and confirmed on Wikipedia, is when the king got to deflower every new bride on her wedding night. So I'm sorry, I had a very different understanding as to what prima nocta meant. I'm trying to get everyone excited about Phyllis' wedding because I want her to get people excited about my wedding when the time comes, which won't be hard, because it's gonna be awesome. A lot better than hers, that's for sure. It'll probably be on a boat. What's up, spinsters? Nothing. You know, this is a luncheon shower. Girls only. No problem. The guys are having a little shindig of their own in the warehouse from 2:30 to 3:15. It is the only time that Bob was available. Sort of a guys' night out. A G.N.O. If you will. A gno. Actually, it's more of a guys' afternoon in. A G.A.I. A gay. Not Not It's not gay. It's just a It's a bridal shower for guys. A guy shower. An hour-long shower with guys. I guess Jim and I have had a little bit of a rough patch for the past couple weeks, but we had some really good talks and, actually now, I think that we're better than ever. Karen and I had a long talk last night and the night before that and every night for the last five nights. Something's up with Jim and Karen. Not that I've been eavesdropping. It's not really any of my business. But I've gotten pretty good at reading the back of Jim's neck. Halpert! Tall, queer, handsome as ever. "Hey, everybody, it's me, Jim. " Hello, hello. Todd Packer. Karen Filippelli, Jim's girlfriend. Shut up! Yep. Shut it! That's rude. Either this chick is a dude or Halpert got scared straight. Yes! Yes! There What happened? What? Oh, God Quick! Somebody help! Help the man! No! No! No! I can't believe you're not gonna be there. It's gonna be good. It's gonna be a great bachelor party, man. I have a full day of sales calls. You should get out of them. Oh, God. It's the only time he can do it. It's gonna be great. We're going to be doing some darts, we're gonna be grilling up some steaks. Got some pie, going to be very delicious. And what kind of stripper did you get? I did not order a stripper. What do you mean you didn't order a stripper? No You ever even been to a bachelor party? Not personally, no. Mike, okay. A stripper is Bachelor Party 101. I I If you don't get a stripper, your party's gonna suck. I can't get a stripper here. Sexual harassment. Get one for the girls, too. That evens it out. Like, you know, separate but equal. So that's what that means. Okay, everybody, a slight change of plans. We are still going to be having two parties, but each is going to get a little extra dose of naughty. All right! Okay. What? Okay, co-ed naked strippers in this office, for realsies. Under no circumstance should a man strip off his clothes in this office. Shut up, Angela! Hey. Hey! Everything okay? Oh, yeah. Why? Well, you seem a little tired. Yeah, well, I guess there's been a couple of late nights. Karen and I have been up talking. You should get more sleep. Yeah, I know I should. Never underestimate the power of a good night's sleep. No, I'm sure you're right. When I get eight hours compared to like, six hours, it's like, big difference. Really? Oh, yeah. You've got to get your REM cycle going with the whole sleeping better than not. Good advice, Beesly. Thanks. See you out there? Yeah. Don't fall asleep at your desk! Oh, my God. Okay. We are off.

Yes, but Ben Franklin was. I'm here to teach you a little bit about my life and the era of the Founding Fathers And when they came over on the Mayflower. Wait. This is the entertainment? Yeah, all right, so, I want you to give him your undivided attention. And Mr. Franklin. If any of these ladies misbehave, I give you permission to spank them, especially that one. Have you ever seen a stripper before? Yes. Jennifer Garner portrayed one on Alias. It was one of her many aliases. Yeah, me neither. Hey. Hi. I'm Elizabeth. I'm the dancer that was requested. Okay. I specifically ordered a stripper. I'm the stripper. Oh, okay. Good. Well, in the future, please identify yourself as such. Oh, God. Okay. "Is she hot?" Text back, "Kind of. " It was a warm June evening in 1752, the night of my fateful kite flight Mr. Franklin? Yes. Do you have a girlfriend? I have a lovely wife, Deborah. But don't you also have girlfriends in Paris? Like, a lot of them? Well, that is a gray area of my life. Okay? So it was a warm June evening Look at that. Nothing like grilling in the great outdoors. Is it the same grill you grilled your foot on? No. Yes, but I got all the foot off of it. Oh, gross. Okay, Ben Franklin. Ben Franklin tied a cherry stem in his mouth! Well, that is because I am a Renaissance man. Ben Franklin? Do you wear boxers, briefs or pantaloons? Well, you're very saucy. Guys! Beef, it's what's for dinner. Who wants some man meat? I do! I want some man meat! Michael, Dwight would like your man meat. Well, then, my man meat he shall have. There you go. Deliciosity. Of course. Here we go. So I guess, you have the Ben Franklin wig and the costume and you figure, "How can I put this to practical use?" Well, I'd like to think that his dad was a Ben Franklin impersonator, and he really pressured him into it. Hey, I wanted to talk to you. I know this is weird or whatever, but Jim told me about you guys. What do you mean? Well, that you kissed. And we talked it through and it's totally fine. It's not a big deal, it's just a kiss. But you're not still interested in him? Oh, yeah. Really? Oh, no! I was confused by your phrasing. You should definitely go out with Jim. I mean, you're going out with Jim. I'm not going out with Jim. You're dating him, which is awesome, because you guys are great together. Okay. And I'm not into Jim. Yeah. So, well, good. Yeah. Sorry. What are you sorry about? What? What are you sorry about? Nothing. I was just thinking of something else. Okay, the game is No-Limit Deuce-To-Seven Lowball. Blinds 25l50. Nickels are worth 10, dimes, 25, and quarters, 50. Nothing wild. I call shuffle! Here we go. Michael Gentlemen, the entertainment is here. Everybody, I'd like to introduce you to Elizabeth. Hi, guys. That's a nice outfit. I hear there's an important meeting here. I'm not really into strippers. You know what I find sexy? Pam's art. She's an artist and I appreciate that. It's very moving and sexy, the art. Hit it! So where's the groom? Oh, he's right there. There he is. Absolutely not. That's all you, that's all you. Okay! All right, I'll do it. Yeah, let's do it! Let's do this thing. Yeah?

When the phone rings, answer it. You want me to answer phones with my clothes on? We hired you for three hours' work, and we're gonna get it. I love your poster. Thank you. You know, I invented electricity. I know. Well, I'm sensing a little electricity right here. Didn't Ben Franklin have syphilis? Yes, but I don't. My name is Gordon. On one hand, I want to be honest with Jan and tell her the truth. On the other hand, I'm afraid she's gonna dump me. You know, Michael, I fathered an illegitimate son. Really? But I kept all this from my wife, Deborah. These things only serve to upset the women. They are the gentler sex. Wow. Ben Franklin, you're really kind of a sleazebag. Stripper? Could I ask you a question about women? Should I tell my girlfriend that you danced up on me? "Secrets, secrets are no fun. "Secrets, secrets hurt someone. " Wow. Thank you. Care for a piece of chocolate? Chocolate? Where did you acquire it? That is a delicacy in the Amazon, but it has not yet been imported to the United States. Who is the king of Austria? Joseph II. Who is the king of Prussia? Friedrich Wilhelm III. Who is the king of England? Why, the tyrant, King George, of course! I don't care what Jim says. That is not the real Ben Franklin. I am 99% sure. Michael, I left a meeting. What is so urgent? Are you Are you okay? Not really. Look, I don't know how to say this, so I just will. Okay. I went to a bachelor party and things got a little out of hand. When When did When, last night? No, today at work. You went to a bachelor party at work? Yes, I kind of arranged it. Well, I don't even think the stripper was that hot. Did you guys think she was hot? Kelly, don't do this. Do what? I just asked you a question. You know what you're doing. Anyway, you know who was totally flirting with Ben Franklin? Pam. Really? Looks like I hired the right guy. I'm glad. Any real potential there, Beesly? Yeah, right. God, I need a boyfriend. You know, Ryan, I'm I'm totally ready to be set up with one of your business school friends. Whenever. Okay. Oh, my God, I would get so fat if I worked here. Yeah? I lose my appetite all the time. You could strip, you know. Thanks. So you don't want to end our relationship? I'm closer to firing you. That is so sweet. You are the best GD girlfriend in the world. Do you know that? I'll talk to you later. You are. You are. So you know who turned out to be kind of a creep? Ben Franklin. And, Elizabeth, the stripper, gave me great advice which rhymed. It really makes you wonder how Ben Franklin can become President, but someone like Elizabeth can't. Are you near-sighted or far-sighted? Both. That's why I invented the bifocals. Oh, damn. I lost another file. Gonna have to reboot, again. Hey, Dwight, do you want an Altoid? What do you think? In school, we learned about this scientist who trained dogs to salivate at the sound of a bell by feeding them whenever a bell rang. So, for the past couple weeks, I've been conducting a similar experiment. Dwight, want an Altoid? Okay. Altoid? Sure. Mint, Dwight? "Mint, Dwight?" Yes. What are you doing? I What? I don't know. I My mouth tastes so bad all of a sudden. Always the bridesmaids, right, ladies? Okay, for this next one, everybody hop out. Just Phyllis and Dad. Actually, let's bring Mom back in and the sisters and you and you and you. Great. Phyllis is getting married and I am in the wedding party. She has asked me to push her father's wheelchair down the aisle. So, basically, I am co-giving away the bride. Since I pay her salary it is like I'm paying for the wedding, which I'm happy to do. It's a big day for Phyllis, but it's an even bigger day for me. Employer of the Bride. Yes. I put Michael in my wedding. It was the only way I could think to get six weeks off for my honeymoon. No one else has ever gotten six weeks before. Phyllis ended up using the exact same invitations as Roy and me. So, it was kind of like being invited to my own wedding. And I was like, "Wait, I thought I called that off?" So, what's in the box? A toaster. You? A toaster. Unbelievable. Hello, Angela. Hi, Dwight. You look as beautiful as the Queen of England. Thank you. Don't linger. Break left. Left. The Schrutes have their own traditions. We usually marry standing in our own graves. It makes the funerals very romantic, but the weddings are a bleak affair. Those flowers are nice. Yeah. "P and R"? Phyllis and Robert? Oh, of course. Also, Pam and Roy. There she is. I swear, Phyllis, you are as beautiful as the first day you started work at Dunder Mifflin. Thanks, Michael. That's sweet. Same as when you said it outside. How you doing? Are you excited? Yes, very. Me, too. If you need to vomit, that is okay. I did. Do you want to talk about tonight? No. Because I know you're probably worried about pleasing Bob. A lot of pressure. Phyllis, did you break wind? It's okay if you did, it's a very natural reaction. It's your wedding, and you're nervous That wasn't me. Okay. I'm sure that Bob Wow, that is That is pungent. I lost my train of thought. Are you set on that hairstyle? I thought it was Michael, no Here, let me. I don't need your help. Thank you, no. Just cover up that bald patch. Michael, please. I just need some time alone. Okay. Okay. You might be surprised to learn that I've only been to one other wedding. It's actually a very cute story. My mom was marrying Jeff, and they asked me to be ring bearer. And I was understandably emotional and somehow my pants became wet. I hate you! A long story short, Jeff's dog ended up as ring bearer. And the irony is that, after the ceremony that dog peed on everything and nobody said boo. Why are all these people here? There's too many people on this Earth. We need a new plague. Who are all these people? You know what? I bet a lot of them are wedding crashers. No way. Did you ever see that movie? Of course I saw it. I saw Wedding Crashers accidentally. I bought a ticket for Grizzly Man and went into the wrong theater. After an hour, I figured I was in the wrong theater, but I kept waiting. Because that's the thing about bear attacks, they come when you least expect it. You know, I just wish I wish I had the investigative powers to actually smoke some of these guys out, you know? Once again, Jim, I will take care of this. I will locate the wedding crashers and report them to Phyllis. That way I won't have to get her a gift. Hi, I'm Kevin. Where did you find her? At the gym. Right. The gym Could you scoot over? You're on my dress. I thought you're not supposed to wear white to a wedding. I know, but there was an emergency. I look really good in white. This strapping, young lad sitting here is Phyllis' father, Elbert, and he is quite the ladies' man. Aren't you, Elbert? Huh? Ring bearer. I could have done better. I will do better. I am going to be better. I can't believe I'm actually doing this. Are you ready for this, Elbert? I am. Let's do it! That's my dress. It's This is Me walking Phyllis down the aisle was supposed to be the highlight of the wedding. And now, the wedding has no highlight. I can't believe I pushed that guy's lazy ass around all day until he was ready to stand up and steal the show. That's Well, I've got news for you, Elbert, if that's your real name, the show's not over. And do you, Phyllis, take Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration, to be your lawfully wedded husband? I do. Ladies and gentlemen, may I present to you, for the first time as a couple, Mr. And Mrs. Bob Vance! And do you, Bob, take Phyllis to be your lawfully wedded wife? I do. You may now kiss the bride. Ladies and gentlemen, for the first time as a couple, Mr. And Mrs. Bob Vance! That's what I'm talking about! Congratulations, Phyllis. You look lovely. Thank you. Your dress is very white. It's so white, my eyes are burning. Thanks, Angela. Congratulations, Bob. You're a good man. But just know, if you ever lay a finger on Phyllis, I will kill you. If you ever lay a finger on Phyllis, I'll kill you. Agreed. No fingers will be laid on Phyllis. Oh, decided to sit down again, huh? Great. Bet you can hear me, too? Best of luck, Phyllis. Also, I'm gonna need to see a copy of the guest manifest as well as photographs of the caterers. I don't have that, Dwight. Damn it, Phyllis! Are you all right? This must be so awful for you. What do you mean? Well, this is supposed to be your wedding. Oh! No, that's actually fine. There's no way it's fine. I'm sorry. If I was you, I would just, like, freak out and get really drunk and then tell someone I was pregnant. Okay. That's a lot of good ideas. Thanks. Excuse me, sir, how do you know the happy couple? Who? The bride and groom. What are their names? I don't I'm not sure I get it. I get it. Come on, freeloader. Let's move it. Come on. Come on. Okay, okay. Where are we going? You've got to find yourself another wedding to crash, my friend. Phyllis? Are you happy with everything? What can I do to make it more perfecter? It's beautiful. Why don't you find your seat and enjoy the buffet. I'm already on it. The chicken? Totally undercooked. I sent it back. It's fish. I will take care of that. I do. I know a fair amount about fine food and drink. This is a white. No, this is not our first wedding. This is the third wedding that Scrantonicity has played. We also played our bassist's wedding and our guitarist's wedding. Attention, everyone. Attention, please. I'm supposed to ask if anyone has seen Uncle Al. He is old and has brown eyes and dementia. His family is very concerned. It's a very serious situation. Roxanne You don't have to put on your red light Those days are over Hey. Hey. I know I don't normally notice these kind of things, but this wedding's really nice. I mean, the flowers and stuff. Phyllis has got some great taste. You're kidding me, right? I know you probably aren't gonna remember this, but, those color roses, I got you those color roses for our prom. Roy, I picked those flowers. Phyllis just stole all of my ideas for our wedding. I guess I wasn't really too involved in the planning. Yeah. Sorry about that. It's okay. Well, you think it sucks for you? I'm the one who actually wanted to get married. Phyllis, you're a wonderful woman. And you're a hell of a bowler! Cheers. Cheers! Thank you, Randy. That was great. Thank you. Thank you very much. Hi, I'm Michael Scott. And, for the next 40 minutes, I am going to be your tour guide through the lives of Phyllis Lapin and Bob Vance, one of the great, seemingly impossible, love stories of our time. My name is Michael Scott. Webster's dictionary defines wedding as "the fusing of two metals with a hot torch. " Well, you know something? I think you guys are two medals, gold medals. For those of you who don't know me, I'm Michael Scott, Phyllis' boss. To quote from The Princess Bride, "Marriage " The most important part of a speech is the opening line. When time is not a factor, I like to try out three or four different ones. Phyllis and Bob, their celebrity couple name would be Flob. You look at her, and she's kind of matronly today, but back in high school, I swear her nickname was Easy Rider. Now, as for Bob. Bob Vance Okay, that's enough. Thanks.  is a guy Thanks, Michael. Give me the mike. He works Okay, hold on, hold on Look I didn't say anything when Phyllis's dad upstaged me at the ceremony. And I think you owe me this, okay? Give me the microphone. No, I'm not going to. Michael, give me the microphone. It's okay. You're out of here. Okay, good. Yeah, you're out of here. You're I hate you! A year has passed since I wrote my note Hey. Hey. When are we gonna get to see some of those famous Beesly dance moves? I'm pacing myself. Come on. Get out there. Give the people what they want. No. I'm such a dorky dancer. I know. And it's very cute. Hypothetically, if I thought Pam was interested, then, no, it's totally hypothetical. Come on. I can't let you in, Michael. Dwight, just No. It's Bob and Phyllis's orders. Look, I just wanted to go in and quietly sit, and have a piece of cake. I'm not even gonna dance, one song, maybe You are a real life wedding crasher and I must bounce you. I'm sorry, it gives me no pleasure. Okay. You remember me when the west wind moves Upon the fields of barley You'll forget the sun in his jealous way As we walk in fields of gold So she took her love For to gaze Even after you're gone And I know that you love Hey!

Here's a non-hypothetical, I'm really happy I'm with Karen. Every little thing she does is magic Everything she do just turns me on Even though my life before was tragic Now I know my love for her goes on One, two, three! Toby Yeah! I just want Phyllis to have a great day. Phyllis and you will be great together. We are great together. We are a great team. The Celtics were a great team. Yes. Yes, they were. Robert Parish I should talk to her. I don't want this to ruin her honeymoon. Well, nobody ever helped me. I had to do it myself. Even the doctor didn't know. Dude, keep it together. I listened to you for a half an hour even though most of that stuff went right over my head. Hey! Yeah! Phyllis? Phyllis, wait, please. I'm sorry. I just I just wanted to make this a day to remember. You found Uncle Al! Yeah, yeah. He's kind of a weirdo. Thank you, Michael. You're You're welcome. They say that your wedding day goes by in such a flash that you're lucky if you even get a piece of your own cake. I say, that's crazy. I say, "Let them eat cake. " Margaret Thatcher said that about marriage. Smart broad. Be careful with the No! Oh, wow! Phyllis. Phyllis, come on. You look like a clown. Here. Oh, get me. Get me!   Hey, Kevin. Nice of you to join us. Where were you? My tire blew out on the way here, Michael. I almost died. I went into this skid Pop quiz. What? Why is today a special day? I almost died. Today is a special day because I am being honored as a visiting professor. Special lecturer? Emeritus, how did you put it? You will be a guest speaker in my Emerging Enterprises class. In business school, Kevin. Business school. Wow. If you bring your boss to class, it automatically bumps you up a full-letter grade. So, I'd be stupid not to do it, right? A boss is like a teacher. And I am like the cool teacher. Like Mr. Handell. Mr. Handell would hang out with us, and he would tell us awesome jokes. And he actually hooked up with one of the students, and then, like, 12 other kids came forward. It was in all the papers. Really ruined eighth grade for us. Here we go. College road show. Gotta bring our A game. What is the most inspiring thing I ever said to you? "Don't be an idiot. " Changed my life. Whenever I'm about to do something, I think, "Would an idiot do that?" And if they would, I do not do that thing. Will they throw their hats, you think? What? A lot of times, at a school or naval academy, after a rousing speech the crowd will throw its hats high into the air. You understand, nobody's graduating. Yeah, I know. I know. I'm just saying, if they did throw their hats, I've got a great line for that. May your hats fly as high your dreams! That was a pretty good line. I'm just It doesn't apply. I understand! Wow! Relax, spazzy boy! Sometimes you're such a little spaz! God, I'm driving! Hey! Quit it. We have fun! I can't wait for your art show tonight. Okay, just so you know, it's just the students from my class in a little studio. I wouldn't miss it for the world. Thanks. I'm really happy to be back with Roy. I think it shows maturity, maturity and dignity. Is that braggy? I don't mean it to be braggy. Love you! You, too. Pam's with Roy, I'm with Karen, and Brangelina is with Frangelina. Moving on! I can't believe you're back together with Roy. Oh, yeah. We have such a solid foundation, you know. Oh, my God, you're so in love now. Yeah. You should come to my art show, by the way. Art show! I mean, it's not a big deal, but I think a lot of people from the office are gonna be there. Yeah. Definitely, I'll be there. For sure. Campus. Brings back so many memories that I would have made. Hey, Frisbee! Check that out! What do you say we get our frizz on before class? Come on. Yeah! Dude! Oh, my God. Animal stool. Dwight, what are you doing? Solving a mystery, if that's quite all right with you! Come to papa! Okay, ladies and gentlemen. What we have here is a bird that has been trapped in a vent. Fortunately, I have found it before Bat! Get it out! Bat! Bat! Oh, my God! Bat! What do you mean No, I won't remain calm! There it goes! Goodbye. God, this is Angela Martin. Please don't let that stupid thing come anywhere near me. Please make it go away! Okay. This is it. Ryan is doing my intro right now. Dunder Mifflin can't compete with the modern chains, and management is unwilling or unable to adapt. Their customers are dying off I can't hear what he's saying, but he looks like he's really into it. We have a bat in the office. Simple solution would be to open a window, if we had windows that could open. Poop is raining from the ceilings. Poop. Okay, thanks. Animal Control will be here at 6:00. At 6:00? No, that is unacceptable. Okay, Jim. You are the number two in this office. You need to step up and show some leadership! I'm sorry, what'd you say? So weird. What? What's so weird? The bat I mean, I know I felt it bite me, but look, there's no mark. I feel so tingly, so strangely powerful. Oh, well. And now, without further ado, I present the regional manager of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton, Michael Scott. Hello, everyone, I am Michael Scott Hello, I'm Brandon Fidalgo, CEO of The Teaching Company. These And I'd like to start today by inspiring you. May I borrow someone's textbook, please? Thank you. What have we here? Ooh, economics. Very, very interesting. You cannot learn from books. Replace these pages with life lessons, and then you will have a book that is worth its weight in gold. I know, those are expensive, but the lesson is priceless. Good. All right, I think you're inspired. Shall we proceed? There are four kinds of business, tourism, food service, railroads and sales. And hospitalslmanufacturing. And air travel. This is your job, Halpert. Ow! What happened? That bread on your desk. I just picked it up. It's white hot. But, Jim, this garlic bread is cold. What? No, it burned me, I Bizarre. No. No. One crisis at a time. If a vampire bat was in the U.S. It would make sense for it to come to a "Sylvania," like Pennsylvania. Now, that doesn't mean that Jim is gonna become a vampire. Only that he carries the vampiric germ. So, you want to start a business. How do you start? What do you need? Well, first of all, you need a building. And secondly, you need supply, you need something to sell. Now, this could be anything. It could be a thingamajig or a who's- he-what's- he or a Whatchamacallit. Now, you need to sell those in order to have a PayDay. And if you sell enough of them, you will make a 100 GRAND. Satisfied? This looks great. I'd love to be there, but my daughter's play is tonight. Damn it! You know, one of the other parents will probably videotape it. So Oh, no, you should go. Well, it's important to support local art. You know? And what they do is not art. Okay, I'm seeing some confused faces out there. Let me slow down a little bit, break this down. Okay. The more stickers you sell, the more profit, fancy word for money, you have to buy PlayStations and Beanie Babies Michael  and products! What we normally do here is more of a question and answer thing. Well, okay I'm just kind of getting going Yeah, I know. All right, okay. Well, we can do questions. Okay, very good. First hand up. Sir, as a company that primarily distributes paper, how have you adapted your business model to function in an increasingly paperless world? We can't overestimate the value of computers. Yes, they are great for playing games and forwarding funny e-mails, but real business is done on paper, okay? Write that down. Hey, Jim, here's the aspirin you wanted. Oh, thank God. I've such a headache from that glare. What glare? The glare off Angela's crucifix. It's blinding. I don't have a lot of experience with vampires, but I have hunted werewolves. I shot one once, but by the time I got to it, it had turned back into my neighbor's dog. Extraordinary events call for extraordinary actions. Will you form an allegiance Sure. to use sudden violence? Okay. Do you have the tools to turn a wooden mop handle into a stake? What size? What do you say to a customer who wants to leave you for the convenience and savings of a nationwide chain? I say, "You will miss our service "and I absolutely guarantee you'll come back. " Has anyone ever come back? We don't want them back. They're stupid. How far has your Herfindahl Index declined since the merger? Nice try. How's your Polack-says-what Index? What? Thanks, Kowalski. Can we get back on track here? By your own employee's calculation, you'll be obsolete in the next five to ten years. Wait. Ryan said that? What are you doing? You better not hurt that little bat. Animals can't feel pain. Don't hurt that bat, Creed! It's a living thing with feelings and a family! Flush him towards the door. On my go! Now! Bat! Kill it! Kill it! Kill it! I am a hero. Yeah, sure. You know business. Sitting up here in your ivory tower and your ebony tower. Well, you know what? I tell you one thing, Dunder Mifflin is here to stay! But how can you compete against a company with the resources of a nationwide chain? David will always beat Goliath! But there's five Goliaths. There's Staples, OfficeMax Yeah, yeah. You know what else is facing five Goliaths? America. Al-Qaeda. Global warming. Sex predators. Mercury poisoning. So do we just give up? Is that what we're learning in business school? But in the big picture, you have Dunder Mifflin is the big picture! Can't you understand that? No, you can't, you're too young. Ryan has never made a sale. And he started a fire, trying to make a cheesy pita. And everybody thinks he's a tease. Well, you know what? He doesn't know anything and neither do you. So, suck on that! It wasn't personal. Business is always personal. It's the most personal thing in the world. When we get back to the office, pack your things. Pack my You heard me. Pack your things. I really want to come out! Good night, Mary Beth! So, you're cool to just wait here for Animal Control? Animal Control? I've been controlling animals since I was six. Cool. Okay. I'm gonna go home and lie down, draw the shades. There's just so much sun in here. Bye, Dwight. Goodbye, Jim. And good luck. Jim is on a path now, an eternal journey, and I wish him well. But I have a destiny in this realm. Specifically, in the kitchen. And it's all from the same series. Called Impressions. Not that I would call myself an impressionist per se. But maybe one day. I hope so. I still need, you know, my breakthrough or whatever. Hey, babe. Hey! How are you? Good. I brought my brother. Hey, Kenny. Hey, Pam. Hey. How about this, huh? I show up with my brother and no one from work is here. That's pretty cool, huh? Magic time. My hair! Get off! Get off me! Get it off me! Get off me! Hold still, woman! Get it off! I got it! I got it! Get it off! You're welcome. It's cool if I go, right? I mean, I looked at all of them. Yeah. I'll just I'll drive myself home. To my place? Maybe. I'm a little tired. Your art was the prettiest art of all the art. Thank you. Look, I'm sorry, okay? I was just trying to do my presentation. And, of course I was wrong to suggest that Dunder Mifflin might ever go out of business. But you don't have to fire me. Fire you? No, no, no. You are moving to the annex. To the annex? Where Kelly is? A good manager doesn't fire people. He hires people and inspires people. People, Ryan. And people will never go out of business. You're the one who said we needed more culture. This is culture to you? It's her first try. Yeah. On Van Gogh's first try, he drew the hands of the peasants. Meaning what? Meaning real art takes courage, okay, and honesty. Well, those aren't Pam's strong points. Yeah, exactly. That's why this is motel art. Thanks for coming. Pamcasso! Sorry I'm late. I had to race across town. Oh, Michael. Wow! You did these? Freehand? Yep. My God, these could be tracings. Look at this one. Wow! You nailed it. How much? What do you mean? I don't see a price. You want to buy it? Well, yeah. Yeah, we have to have it for the office. I mean, there's my window. And there's my car! Is that your car? That is our building. And we sell paper. I am really proud of you. Thank you. What? Do you have something in your pocket? A Chunky. Do you want half? No, thank you. Okay. It is a message. It is an inspiration. It is a source of beauty. And without paper, it could not have happened. Unless you had a camera. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! It's only temporary, okay? Don't get excited. I won't. I won't. I won't. I won't. I won't! I won't! I won't! I won't! I won't! I won't! I won't!   Can you confirm that the straps are tight? Yes. But this seems a little And now the chains. A lot of people think that magic camp is just for kids. And that's why so many other people in my class were kids. Self-fulfilling prophecy. It's really for anybody with a dream and a belief in magic, and a little extra time after school. Magic, magic, magic. And now, Michael the Magic will attempt to escape from extreme bondage. Can he do it? I don't see how he can. I know how. He'll dislocate his shoulder and slip his arm out. No. No. Everyone, now count down with me. Three Sorry. Sorry, quick thing. So is it true that if you can't get out, you don't want anyone to help you? I will get out. Oh, yes. I will. So we shouldn't help you no matter how much you might beg and plead? No. All right. Just This is getting hot, so let's just do this, okay? Ready! Three! Two! One! Go! Is everything okay, Michael? Yes. I cannot tell you how I plan to escape other than by using magic. That is the magician's code. Separately on an unrelated note, if you happen to find a small brass key All right, ready? Come on, guys. Early worm gets the worm. Another worm, like, are they friends? That's, "Early bird gets the worm. " Okay. Pam, would you smell my breath? No. No. Let me smell. Good. Not great. Michael, you go to parties all the time. Why is tonight so special? Well, tonight is so special because my boss's boss's boss, the CFO, not his initials, common mistake, is having a little shindig for all the managers in the company. And Jan and I are going as a couple for the first time. So it's kind of our coming out party, really. And that is why tonight is so special. Jimbo, last chance, carpool. Oh, no thanks. I think Karen and I will take my car. You sure? Might be a good idea Yeah. if we all went together, we could save some gas, have fun. Long trip. Thanks. Play some games? Not Yeah. I Spy. Why don't I wanna go? Didn't expect to need a reason. So, let me think here. I don't know any of these people. It's an obligation. I don't like talking paper in my free time. Or in my work time. And did I use the word "pointless"? Thanks for inviting me along. Oh, sure. I really didn't give it any thought. Wait, should you be going? Hello, you. Michael? Hey, buttercup. Hi. I am on my way. I should be there in about 15 All right, let's just blow this party off. That's what she said. Yeah. Am I on speakerphone? Yes, you are. Is anybody else Hello, Jan! Hi, Dwight. Okay, Michael, take me off speakerphone. No problem. Okay, let's just go to a motel and Okay. just, like, rip into each other like we did on that black sand beach in Jamaica. Okay, Jan? Jan, this party is actually a very big step for us. So I I'm still on speaker? I I I don't know. Are the cameras there? Maybe. Okay. See you soon. Okay. All right. Bye. Talk to you later, Jan. Hey, Michael left early. So a bunch of us are gonna go to Poor Richards for happy hour. You should come. I can't. My brother, he just unloaded the jet skis and he, kind of, took a bath, so we're gonna go get hammered. Okay. Well, we're going to a bar. Hey, you have to come to stuff with me. I'm serious. If you're going to be my boyfriend, you have to do boyfriend things. Okay. I've decided that I'm going to be more honest. I'm gonna start telling people what I want directly. So look out world 'cause old Pammy is getting what she wants. And don't call me Pammy. Beauty. Thank you, sir. Thanks a lot. Thank you. You're dressed exactly like the servants. Shut up. Okay, change shirts with me. Wait. I don't think yours will fit me. I don't care. Oh, wow. Here. Don't put my jacket on Don't give me that. That would have been really embarrassing. Yes. Crisis averted. Okay That duck is so cute. Hey, Pam. Hey, guys. Oscar. Angela. Hi! Actually, it's polite to arrive early. And smart. Only really good friends show up early. Ergo, de facto, go to a party early, become a really good friend. Oh, potato salad? It's from both of us. No, it's not. Wonderful. Let's see where we can put this. Okay. Oh, you know, you probably want to leave the cover on until the guests get here. It's been sitting in my car all day. Sun beating down on the mayonnaise. Just You never know. Kevin, you and Stacy set a date yet? Yeah. Oh, my God. When is it? It's complicated. I would appreciate some space on this. Hey! Hey! You made it. Well, you said it was important, so It is. How's it going? What's up, Pam? Hey, Kenny. Sorry about the jet skis. You guys all want a round on me? Yeah! Yeah? Let's get you a drink. Thanks, man. I'm thirsty. No, thank you. Roy, I You should get a round, Pam. Oh, you know that line on the top of the shrimp? That's feces. What you looking for? You bring dip? I'm sure that it's catered. I need you to sign these, Michael. It's a waiver of some of your rights. You should read it carefully. It releases the company in the event that our relationship, in your opinion or in reality, interferes with work. You get a copy, I get a copy and a third copy goes to HR. Awesome. I'm gonna frame mine. I could frame yours, too. You realize this is This is a legal document that says you can't sue the company Over our love. I've never told you that I love you. You don't have to, Jan. This contract says it all. I am taking a calculated risk. What's the upside? I overcome my nausea, fall deeply in love, babies, normalcy, no more self-loathing. Downside? I date Michael Scott publicly and collapse in on myself like a dying star. What's this over the "I"? It's a heart. Why is this so hard? That's what she said. Oh, my God, what am I saying? I love this woman! Oh, God. Michael, please. Michael, please. Do you ever watch Battlestar Galactica? No. No? Then you're an idiot. Hello, Michael. Rachel! Boy, you clean up good. The place looks great with all the lights on and everything. Actually looks bigger with people in it. It's weird. So Jan, glad you could make it. Oh, of course. Of course, David. Do you remember Michael Scott from the Scranton branch? Of course I do. How are you, Michael? Jan and I are lovers. It feels so good to finally say that out loud. David, can I speak to you privately for just a moment, please? Excuse me. Okay. No. Actually, one of these is supposed to be a light. Oh, sorry. So did the merger go smoothly or It did. "Like butter. " Mike Myers, SNL. You should ask Karen. She was one of them. I'm the only one left. Everybody else was either fired or quit. And there's one in anger management. Yeah. But you're great now, right? We're all great. Aren't we great? We're good. Michael, please stop that, okay? Can I get anyone anything? I could go for an appe-teaser. Martini, please. Yep, Bagel Bites or something. Rachel, your house is beautiful. Thank you. What's the square footage? About 5,000. Does that include the garage? Dwight, wow. That's not appropriate. I don't know. It's a common question. David, how much did this house cost? These old Colonials are great when they're sound. I'd love to take a look around. I'll show you around, sure. Cool. Let's start with the banisters. Hey. Do you see that guy behind you in the blue blazer against the wall? Yep. That's Drake. And just so, you know, I don't want to be weird or anything, but we used to date. Okay. Cool. Thanks for telling me. And it didn't end well. Got you. All right. This was a gift from Lee lacocca. Twenty-year-old single malt Scotch. Here is to Mr. Lacocca and his failed experiment, the De Lorean. Are you okay? Yeah. Do you have any ice? Sure. How about some Splenda? One, two, three! Up Jenkins! Down Jenkins! Oh, I think I hear the quarter over here. Where? On this side. No, it is definitely under one of these hands. I, kind of, heard it on Roy's side too. No. It is here. Not here. Not here. Not here. Not here. Good thing you didn't listen to me. Yeah. Close one. Not here. It's not here. Okay, it's either here or here. Not here. Oh, yes! Yes! Nice job. I can read you like a book. Oh, yeah? You can't keep anything from me. Bottoms up! Hey, Creed. Hey! What's up, Creed? What do you guys up to? Hello. You're the man, buddy. I run a small fake ID company from my car with a laminating machine that I swiped from the sheriff's station. Yeah, these studs are way too far apart. What's in here? That's a guest room. Just the one window? Oh, I must get that. You'll have to excuse me. Are those real pearls? Yes. They're Good. Well, it was nice meeting you guys. Take care. Well, if you're wondering why his wife was staring daggers at me, it's because I kind of saw him for a little bit when they were separated. Oh, didn't notice. Really? I thought it was so obvious. I'm glad it didn't make you uncomfortable. No, it was before I knew you, so it's fine. This one really smells like vanilla. Check that out. That's nice. You and the missus should join us in Sandals, Jamaica next Christmas. Michael, I think David probably wants to spend Christmas here with his family. Yeah. They don't allow kids at Sandals. They are persona non grata there. Oh, but it's fun. It is an awesome place. You would not believe how low this girl can limbo. It's crazy. David, I'm sorry, you're just going to have to excuse us for just a couple minutes. Sorry. Okay. Okay. Excuse me. What's going on? What is it? Sorry. What's What's the matter? What What did I Come on. Just Just Just What are you doing? Don't you know what I'm doing? Yeah, but you could tell me. Wow. What What is that? Why are we Why are we going in the bathroom? I thought this was where you liked your privacy. Shut up. What has gotten into you? No, no, no. What? Come on, let's get back to the party. Come on. Wait, let me just take my dress off. We're missing everybody. Don't take that No, stop it! Stop it! Jan! No! No! No! Michael No means "Please don't. " Means Slam me up against the wall right here. I'm not going to slam you up against anything. You're acting inappropriate, Jan. I want you so I'm acting inappropriate? Yeah. Forget it. Get out of my way. Here. Hey! Where have you been all night? I was looking forward to hanging out with you. I was Hey, don't you have a daughter? Yes. Oh, good. You're up. Hey, who makes this chair? I don't know. It was here when I was born. I want one. It's really good, solid construction. It's comfortable. What is this, oak? I don't know. What do you know? God, I hate these parties. You wanna sneak out back and shoot some hoops? Meet me outside in two minutes. Now you stay here and have fun 'cause I'm going to go out back and shoot hoops with David Wallace. Okay. Don't mention that you and I are dating 'cause I think he might still have feelings for me. Wallace? What the hell? Have you dated, like, every guy here? Wow. Okay. You got me. I so got you. So none of them? Of course not. I mean you're, kind of, like, my first. Really? Oh, my God, it's so easy Okay. it's not even fun. Hey, Jan. Not too good. Did you get a chance to try Michael's homemade potato salad? Rachel thinks that I brought homemade potato salad. But I just picked it up at the supermarket. It's funny. I wish I could make potato salad that good. It's just potatoes and mayonnaise. There's something wrong with Jan. What's What's with Jan and Michael? I don't know Where to begin. My ball. The chimney's in decent shape. Not great. I found some termite damage in a crawl space and some structural flaws in the foundation. So, all in all, it was a pretty fun cocktail party. What? I want us to make it. I want a fresh start. That's awesome. That's what I want. Okay, but in order for us to make it, there can't be any secrets between us. I didn't I didn't do anything. Ask anybody. I totally could have and I didn't at all. Just listen. Remember that casino night about a month before we were supposed to get married? I kissed Jim. What? He told me how he felt and I guess I had feelings, too. And we kissed. Jim came on to you? Just listen. No, I am listening! That's the problem, I'm listening! Don't yell. Don't yell? This is over. Yeah. You're right. This is so over! Are you kidding me, Pam? Come on! God! Stupid jet skis! Our first fight. If this is about what happened in the bathroom, there was no place to cuddle I feel sick. You didn't have any of the potato salad, did you? You know, we were good when we were just running around, you know? In secret. It was wrong and it was exciting, and maybe it was a mistake to take it public. Well, if that's the way you feel, my lady, then you have hurt me greatly. Michael Greatly. Please don't cry. I'm not going to cry. I feel like it, but I am not going to. Why don't you just take your stupid love contract and tear it up into a million pieces? It was never a love contract, Michael. Yeah. And besides, I have already given a copy to David. It would be just as embarrassing to get it back from him as it was handing it to him I want the house, Jan. I want the picket fence. I want the ketchup fights and the tickling and the giggling. I didn't mean it, okay? I was Whatever. I was tired. I'm tired and I didn't eat enough. And that's all. That was it. That's it. You didn't mean it. That's all. No, I didn't. So That's all. I'm just saying I didn't mean it. Okay. Fine. I love you, Jan. Okay. Don't break up, you guys. You're great together. Are they gonna call the cops? No. I paid them off. Jet ski money? All of it. I'm gonna kill Jim Halpert. So, do you want to see it or not? I don't know. They're, like, Friday night crowds Oh, my God. You're, like, agoraphobic. Agoraphobic? Yeah. Really. Yeah. You would rather sit on your couch and watch a Phillies game than go out to a movie with your awesome girlfriend. Absolutely correct. Later, Jim. Kev, have a good weekend. Yeah, sure. Bye. Okay, so this is what's gonna happen. You're going to suck it up. Here we go. And we're gonna go to dinner. Okay. And then we're gonna go to the movies. Sounds good. Hey, Halpert. Hey. Roy! Roy! God! Pam, please call security. Every day for eight years, I have brought pepper spray into this office to protect myself and my fellow employees. And every day, for eight years, people have laughed at me. Well, who's laughing now? No need for consternation. Everything is under control. Michael, last Friday, one of your employees attacked another employee in your office. It was a crime of passion, Jan. Not a disgruntled employee. Everyone here is extremely gruntled. Is Toby there? No. I'm here, Jan. What is the situation, Toby? Well, we fired Roy, obviously. And Jim won't press charges against Roy or the company. Thank God. Yeah. But now, apparently, Darryl has some issue with this No, he has been wanting a raise for a couple of months, and he's just using this Roy thing as leverage. Well, are you gonna take care of this? Yeppers. What did I tell you about "yeppers"? I don't remember. I told you not to say it. Do you remember that? Yesh. I really don't want to talk about it. I don't mean to be rude. But I just, I don't want to comment on what happened. It sucked. I guess all things considered, I was lucky Dwight was there. And Roy was lucky that Dwight only used pepper spray, and not the nunchakus or the throwing stars. Hey, man, I never got a chance to thank you for stopping Roy. Thank you. "Thank you" not necessary and thus not accepted. I saw someone breaking the law and I interceded. Okay. Got you something. Don't want it. You don't know what it is. Don't want it, won't open it, don't need it, won't take it. Citizens do not accept prizes for being citizens. It was a little glass display case for his bobblehead. That would have made his evening, I think. He saves my life, I get him a box for his desk toy. Even-Steven. No, don't call me a hero. Do you know who the real heroes are? The guys who wake up every morning and go into their normal jobs, and get a distress call from the Commissioner and take off their glasses and change into capes and fly around fighting crime. Those are the real heroes. Angela, Roy's check. He's coming in later to pick it up. Man, I cannot believe I missed the fight. It was crazy. Man. You saw it? Describe it, please. Well I heard some shouting, and I look over and Roy's by reception, and you could just tell he's gonna punch somebody. Jim says something, Roy stops over there, all of a sudden, bam, Roy goes down and Dwight's standing there like an action hero. Oh. It was insane. Well, good for Dwight. Okay, I want you to be Darryl and ask me for a raise because I need to try out some of these negotiation tactics on you. Where'd you get that? Wikipedia. Wikipedia is the best thing ever. Anyone in the world can write anything they want about any subject, so you know you are getting the best possible information. Okay, Darryl, ask me for a raise. Hey, Mike, since Roy left I've been doing a lot more work and I need a raise. Well, that's interesting, Darryl. I think that maybe you should Can't hear you. What I'm saying is that Still nothing. Okay. See what I did? No. By leaning back and by whispering, I established a dominant physical position. Nice. Okay, let's try another one. Okay. Walking out of the room unexpectedly. And what happens in this one? That's a surprise. Okay. Go ahead, ask me for a raise. Can I have a raise? Sex. Steve Martin. Teri Hatcher. What? What? Well, what did you say? I didn't say anything. I was waiting to see what would happen. No, it's It sounded interesting, what you were gonna I saw the perpetrator advance towards the victim at a high rate of speed. His head was thrown back, his shoulder and arm cocked, indicating an attack position. Perp grabbed the victim. I removed my weapon from its secure hiding place. Which is where? Irrelevant. Discharged it at a distance of a little over a meter into the perpetrator's eyes, nose and face area, rendering him utterly and completely disabled. Then I contacted the authorities. The end. Thanks, Dwight. That is the bravest thing I have ever heard. I can't imagine what I would have done. I can. You would have left me to fend for myself. Like the time we were on the Ferris wheel, and that kid dropped a milkshake on me and you just laughed. Well, that was funny. That's why. Oh, it was? Okay, well, the next time that you get scared that you think a murderer is in your apartment in the middle of the night, and you call me to calm you down Okay, you know what, I Could you stop?  you can just call somebody else because I'm not going to do it anymore, Ryan. I'm not. Well, don't talk to me about calling There's a bunch of people back here. I call you in the middle of the night Guys. to tell you that I love you. I don't think Michael intended to punish me by putting Ryan back here with Kelly. But if he did intend that Wow. Genius. Yeah? You ready for me? Yes, yeah. Absolutely. Have a seat. You know what, actually, let's go into the conference room. Okay. No, you know what, let's stay here. Let's go. Yeah, let's go to the conference room. Tactic number six. Change the location of the meeting at the last second. Totally throws them off. Number 14, declining to speak first. Makes them feel uncomfortable, puts you in control. I am declining to speak first. Okay, I'll start. It's pretty simple, really. I think I deserve a raise. I'm scheduled to get one in six months, but I'd like that to be moved up to now. Darryl, you are a good worker and a good man. I just You know, times are tight, and I just don't think corporate's going to go for this right now. Are you wearing lady clothes? What? Are you wearing lady clothes? Those look like lady pants. No. This is a power suit. That there is a woman's suit. I do not buy women's clothes. Do not make that mistake again. I'm going to call Roy, man. Okay. All right. This is going to make him feel better. This is too good. All right. You know what, Pam, would you please tell Darryl that this is not a woman's suit? Oh, my God. That's a woman's suit. You're wearing a woman's suit? No. I do I wear men's suits. Okay? I got this out of a bin. There were these huge bins of clothes, and everybody was riffling through them like crazy. And I grabbed one. And it fit. So I don't think that this is totally just a woman's suit. At the very least, it's bisexual. Who makes it? It is mysterious, because the buttons are on the wrong side. That's the mystery. Look, it's got shoulder pads. And did you see that lining? Okay. Did you see that? Would you stop it, please? So none of that tipped you off? It's European, okay? It's a European cut. Michael, the pants don't have any pockets. No, they don't, see? Italians don't wear pockets. It's been a really rough couple of days. This helps a little. Hey, maybe you want to come over and raid my closet? No, I don't want to do that because I'm twice your size anyway. Yeah, he look like Hillary Clinton. Let's just do this in 15. Okay, can you stand right there for one second? I got to send some e-mails. Negotiations are all about controlling things, about being in the driver's seat. And you make one tiny mistake, you're dead. I made one tiny mistake. I wore women's clothes. So, Karen, how do you feel that Roy tried to kick your boyfriend's ass over another woman? I feel great, Kevin. Thank you. You must have been scared out of your mind. Well, you know, it happened so fast, I didn't really have time to be scared. What happened, exactly? I wasn't here. So I haven't really heard the whole story. Well, Jim and I were talking. And Roy walked in, looking super angry. And he's a big dude, you know? And all of a sudden, Jim pushed me out of the way and Roy cocked his fist. And then? And then, bam, Dwight sprays him and knocks him on his butt. Goodness. When I heard Jim and Pam had kissed, my reaction was to have lots of long talks with Jim about our feelings. Roy just attacked him. I'm not sure which one Jim hated more. Let's get down to business. Why don't you tell me why you think you deserve a raise. Well, it's simple, Mike. I mean, we merged these two branches, right? So now we're shipping twice as many orders as we used to. And with Roy gone, we've got a smaller crew. And I'm picking up all of his slack, so I think I should be compensated fairly by getting a raise. Well, those are very good points. What? I can't hear you. Those are very good points. I can't What, Mike? Are you You make a very compelling argument. Sorry I almost got you killed. Yeah. That was nuts. He could have broken your nose or something. Crazy. It's just so stupid. I mean, getting back with Roy and everything. I mean, what I was thinking, right? No, I mean, you guys really seem to have a strong connection. Not anymore. It's completely over now. We'll see. I'm sure you guys will find your way back to one another someday. Jim. I am really sorry. Oh, yeah. Don't worry about it. I'm going to give you a piece of paper. I want you to write down how much you want. Then I want you to slide it back across the desk to me. Why can't I just tell you? Because that is the way these things are done in films. Now slide it. Yes. There you go. Oh, come on. Be serious. I am serious, Mike. That's a 10-percent raise. That's what I want. I can't give you that. I don't make this much. Come on, be for real, Mike. I don't. I'll prove it to you. There is a pay stub. Are you serious? You're earning this? Plus perks. Yes. Mike, this is barely more than I make. You've been here ten years, dawg. Fourteen years. No, please, please don't. I'm sorry, Mike. Some mofos got to hear about this one. Okay. Let's take 15 again. A boss' salary isn't just about money. It is about perks. It For example, every year I get a $100 gas card. Can't put a price tag on that. Okay. If you don't want a gift, at least let me buy you a beer or lunch or something. When Han Solo returns to the Death Star in the Millennium Falcon, and shoots down the TIE fighters and saves the Rebel cause, do you think he does so for a free beer? Boy, I No. And why are you so interested in buying me something, Jim? What's your angle? It's like when he annoys me and I want to screw with him to get him back, he never sees it coming. But now I want to be nice to him and actually give him something, and he's like an eel. I just can't grab onto him. It's infuriating. Maybe you just feel guilty about all the pranks. No. Yes. That's probably what it is. So what do I do? I don't know. Maybe you should go back out there and sell paper so we can go on a trip. Michael? Here's the $15 I owe you. Thank you. Yeah. I heard you might need it, so Here's the $40 you gave me. I didn't give you $40. In a way, you did. Yeah. I heard how much Michael makes. I still think he's way overpaid. Fourteen years. Fourteen. I know. Okay, all right, I got to go. Late. Okay. Okay. Here's the straight dope. No tricks, no Wikipedia. What? I talked to corporate and they told me that I can only give you a five-percent raise. That's 'cause of you, Mike. They're not going to give the working man more than the boss. Well, what am I supposed to do? Get your own raise. You've got to get out there and earn, son. I'm not going to go out and ask for a raise right now. That is ridiculous. Well, when they merged the two branches together, they put you in charge. Okay? And we're shipping more now than we ever have. That's true. Yeah, that's true. You got to call your girl and get paid. Show her who wears the pants in the relationship. You know what, I should. Yeah, you should. I've been a loyal employee for a long time. Fourteen years long. You know what, I deserve a bump. Make it happen, Captain. I am making it happen, Sergeant. I remember it was very late at night, like 11:00, 11:30. Big fella comes in screaming about God knows what. I think maybe Halpert had stolen his car, something like that. So the big fella pulls out a sock filled with nickels. Then Schrute grabs a can of hairspray and a lighter You're useless. Well, why don't we talk next month after the quarter ends? No, Jan. I've never asked for a raise in 14 years. This is long overdue. I want to do it today. Today? All right, well, if you want to do it today, we should do it in person, and can you get here by 5:00? Yeah. Yeah, I'll leave right away. Great. And listen, because of our, you know, situation, we're going to need to have a third party present. Yes. I'm bringing Darryl. Darryl from the warehouse? Mmm-hmm. No, Michael, we We need an HR rep, so I think you should just bring Toby. Hey, I'd rather kill myself. Michael, he's your branch's HR rep No, Toby is terrible. and we need someone else in the room Toby is the worst human being I've ever known. because of our relationship. Michael! Either Toby comes with you or we don't do it. Fine. You are so mean. I don't know what you're talking about. Yes, you do, Ryan Bailey Howard. You called me stupid. No. I said Toby, come on, let's go. Where? Where? I'm going to smack you in the head with a hammer. Come on, let's go. What is so stupid about wanting to name a baby Usher? All right. Usher Jennifer Hudson Kapour. Don't you see why that's insane? Oh, so I'm crazy now? Comfortable, Mike? Yeah. What about you, man, you comfortable? No. Don't ever touch a black man's radio. Chris Tucker, Rush Hour. I won't touch yours, by the way. Thank you. I haven't been to New York in a long time. Big Apple. Maybe I'll stay overnight. I got a cousin who lives down there. How will we get home? Oh, you can stay, too. He's got a big place. Maybe I'll stay. It's not that big. Buses, though, will get you home quick. And then all of a sudden Dwight stood up and was like, "No!" Then what did he do? Well, you should just read the report that Toby did. He took everyone's stories. Dunder Mifflin, customer service. This is Kelly. Oh, yeah, I can totally help you with that. Okay. Let me just get the folder out. Okay, it seems here that you ordered 12,000 reams of paper. Oh, 12 reams? Hey, guys. Jan is ready for you. Okay. Okay. Bring it home now. And don't forget the new black-man phrase I taught you. Pippety poppety, give me the zoppety. Yes, sir. Remember that. I'll be right outside if you need me. All right. Yeah. I taught Mike some new phrases. I want him to get the raise. I just can't help myself. Hey, man I'm sorry. Thanks. Can I, like, see you after work for coffee or something? I don't know. Please. I just got some stuff I got to say to you. Jim. Roy. Look out! Thanks, Kev. I'm good, though. Thank you, Hunter. Hello. Come in. Okay. Who is the boy toy? That's my new assistant. Were you going to tell me that you hired James Van Der Beek? I have to call you the second I get a new assistant now? Be nice to get a memo. We are lovers. Hi, Jan. Hi, Toby. First First off, Michael, this is a salary negotiation. All matters regarding our personal relationship have to be set aside. Are we clear? Bippety, boppety. Right now, we can offer you a six-percent raise. Six percent? After all we've been through? Oh, God. I got you jade earrings. Michael. No. No. No. Michael. You're going to play it like this? You give me a good raise or no more sex. What are you writing, perv-ball? Just preparing for the deposition. This may the first time that a male subordinate has attempted to get a modest, scheduled raise by threatening to withhold sex from a female superior. It will be a groundbreaking case when it inevitably goes to trial. I'm so sorry, Pammy. I mean, I wasn't going to do anything, but then I kept thinking about you two together. I just thought you guys were really good friends or maybe he was gay or something. Not that that's wrong. I'm sorry, too. I just I think that we both made some bad choices. So, you going to start dating Halpert then? No. No. He has a girlfriend. Oh, yeah. Wait a minute, you broke up our wedding for the guy. No. There were a lot of reasons. What, you're not even going to try to go out with him? I don't get you, Pam. I know. What's this? What's what? "Certificate of Bravery from the Scranton Police Department "recognizing outstanding citizenship from a very brave young man, "Dwight K. Schrute. " Wow. I guess word got around. That's a nice honor. Please. They hand these out to little kids. Look, there's a teddy bear in a policeman's cap. Didn't think you'd notice. Why don't you just take that pen and stab me in the heart? This is me, Jan. This is me. Okay. Michael, please. You know, why don't we just take a break? Okay. This is This is going nowhere. No. No. No. You do not try tactic number eight on me. I invented tactic number eight. I'm not going anywhere. Okay, Toby, how about if you Sure. Great. What's wrong with you? I don't know. Was a weird day. I accidentally cross-dressed. And then Darryl made me feel bad for not making any money. And then I had to ride up here with stupid Toby. And then your assistant is all young and hot and I Okay, Michael. I can offer you a 12-percent raise, but you have got to ask for 15. That's ridiculous. I'm never going to No, just I just need you to ask for it so I can record that you asked for it. Okay? Ah so. All right, Levinson, here's the rub. I would like a 15-percent raise. No, but we can offer you 12. But you just said 15. Negotiation is an art. Back and forth. Give and take. And today, both Darryl and I took something. Higher salaries. Win, win, win. But, you know, life is about more than just salary. It's about perks. Like having sex with Jan Michael. So, you and Bob are looking at a historical house? Near the river. How many bedrooms? Four. Dwight. Dwight. I've been doing some very interesting reading. Really? Tales of bravery. Good stuff? I was thinking tonight we could read it together. That sounds fun. I will never say a word. And now we are even. I graduated from anger management the same way I graduated from Cornell. On time. Now I'm back, got a second chance and I'm not going to blow it. So, look out, Dunder Mifflin. I mean "look out" in a fun way. You know, not like, "I'm going to hurt you. " Hey, guys, guess who's back? Oh, God! No need to thank me. I'm not a hero. I'm a mere defender of the office. You know who's a real hero? Hiro from Heroes. That's a hero. Also Bono. Good morning, Pam. Oh, welcome back, Andy. Drew. I'm Drew now. Oh, Drew. Sorry. Apology not accepted. Because it wasn't even necessary in the first place. Several weeks ago, Andy Bernard had an incident. But after five weeks in anger management, I'm back, and I've got a new attitude and a new name and a bunch of new techniques for dealing with the grumpies. Morning, Jim. Hey, Andy. How are you, man? Good. Drew. What's that? You can call me Drew. No, I'm not gonna call you that. Cool. I can't control what you do. I can only control what I do. Andy. Drew. Dwight. How's it going, man? Yes. I have decided to shun Andy Bernard for the next three years. Which I'm looking forward to. It's an Amish technique. It's like slapping someone with silence. I was shunned from the age of four until my sixth birthday for not saving the excess oil from a can of tuna. Jim, could you please inform Andy Bernard that he is being shunned? Andy, Dwight says welcome back and that he could use a hug. Okay. Tell him that that's not true. Dwight says that he actually doesn't know one single fact about bear attacks. Okay. No, Jim. You guys. Tell him that bears can climb faster than they can run. Jim, tell him! Andy No, it's too far. Damn you. Today is safety training day. Toby is leading ours upstairs. But I am giving everyone a little bit of a treat. We are going to listen in on Darryl's presentation at the warehouse. And if I know Darryl, it gonna be zoppity. Now, this is the forklift. You need a license to operate this machine. That means the upstairs office workers can't drive it. Quiz. Mike. Should you drive the forklift? I can and I have. No, no, no! I said, "Should you?" You should not drive it. You should not drive the forklift. You understand? You're not allowed to drive the forklift. It's not safe. You don't have a license. Guys, I'm not the only one who's driven the forklift. Pudge has driven the forklift. Madge. I thought your name was Pudge. No. It's always been Madge. Okay. Her. Her? Yes, "Her" is qualified to work a dangerous machine. You are not. Okay? Fine. Do you understand that? Yes. We do safety training every year or after an accident. We've never made it a full year. This particular time, I was reaching for a supply box on the top shelf when one office worker, who shall remain nameless, kicked the ladder out from under me and yelled Hey, Darryl, how's it hanging? And I fell and busted my ankle and I'm legitimately scared for my workers. The baler can flatten a car engine. It can cut off your arm and crush your entire body without skipping a beat. Yeah! How many people a year do you think get their arms cut off in a baler? Bale 'er? I hardly know her. Damn it, Michael, pay attention, man. Anybody want to take a guess? Five bucks says it's over fifty. You really want to bet? Anybody? Ever since March Madness ended, I am so bored. How many? Okay. You're on. Ten people. Michael. Ten people. Would you like to be one of them? No, don't worry about it. We'll just go double or nothing. On what? I don't know. I'll figure something out. Nice. What are you guys talking about? These are very dangerous machines down here and the upstairs workers Michael? should not go anywhere near them. Yes. Yes. But it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world It would be the worst thing in the world. It would. What the hell is wrong with this man? Very much so. It's a big red trash compactor. It's not a trash compactor! It's very dangerous, okay. Don't disrespect a baler, Mike. All right, all right, I got it! I got it! Only on the rarest of occasions would I go near No, you don't touch it! There is no occasion for you to go near this stuff, okay? Toby now has the floor and he is going to try not to screw this up like everything else in his life. Let me rephrase that. I believe that you can do safety training and make it sound just as good as Darryl. Here we go! Okay, one thing you're going to want to look out for is carpal tunnel syndrome. It's recommended that you take a 10-minute break from typing every hour. For your circulation, you're going to want to get up out of your chairs and move around for about 10 minutes every hour. Yes. Good. Fine. Like stretching and Yeah, your computer screen can be a big strain on your eyes, so it's also recommended that you step away for about 10 minutes every hour. Wow? That is That time really adds up. That's like a half an hour, every hour? Take them at the same time. Okay. You know what? You're making it sound kind of lame. So skip ahead to the really dangerous stuff. Like sometimes computers can explode, can they not? No. No. You always want to keep a sweater or cardigan of some sort in case it gets drafty. What about a long-sleeved tee? That will work. Long johns? A shawl? You know, anything that warms you. Okay, you know what, I think that everybody is going to vomit due to boredom. Sorry. He is very lame. Let's see. Seasonal affective disorder. A depression that includes weight gain, fatigue, irritability, brought on by the low light of winter. Thank God we only had a baler to deal with. Yeah, that dim light is a bitch, ain't it? Okay. Guys, you know what? I didn't interrupt when you were having your presentation. Actually, you did. Yes. Okay. Let's do another one. This is a good one. A particular concern for office workers is a sedimentary lifestyle which can contribute Sedentary. Yes. Which can contribute to heart disease. Heart disease kills more people than balers. That's called having a fat butt, Michael. No. No, it's sedentary. Yeah, that's fat butt disease. That's what you suffer from? You have fat butt disease, Michael? Excuse me, sea monster, you weigh like a thousand pounds. Yeah? Yeah. I bet you'd like to swim with this sea monster, wouldn't you? Ryan! Dude, please tell your girl to shut up. What? Kelly, you've insulted the gentleman. Please apologize. Are you kidding me? All right, we out of here. Darryl, I did not walk out in the middle of yours, so Yeah, but ours was real, Michael. Yes. That's what we've been trying to tell you, Mike. It's serious down there. We do dangerous stuff, man. This is shenanigans, foolishness. Nerf ball. You live a sweet little nerfy life sitting on your biscuit never having to risk it. Okay. What? So, Nerf isn't cool anymore? Darryl thinks he's such a man because he works in a warehouse. Well, big deal! I worked in a warehouse. Men's Wearhouse. I was a greeter. I'd like to see Darryl greet people. He'd probably make them feel like wimps. Not me, I Hello, I'm Michael. Welcome to Men's Wearhouse. We have a special on khaki pants today. This is one example. Ten. Really? Ten? That's your guess? You're a professional accountant. There's, like, Forty-two. I'm going to say 50. Don't be that person. Oh, come on. That is lame. It's a strategy. It's called being smart. Thank you. Oh, jeez. I don't know how the whole betting thing started, but it's fun. Ten. Ten's out. Damn it! Forty-seven, 48, forty-nine. Jim wins. That is not fair. He has spent hours up here at reception with you. Hours and hours. Okay. Okay. No, constantly. Like for years. Okay. Pam, depression is as scary as a baler, right? I don't understand the question. Working in an office can lead to depression, which can lead to suicide. I mean this is really serious stuff. Yeah. Nobody commits suicide because they work with a baler. And yet those guys are making fun of me, calling me a Nerf. That It's really hard to demonstrate depression. Their safety training had visuals. Yeah. You are so right. They have visual aids and all we had were the facts. You don't go to the science museum and get handed a pamphlet on electricity. You go to the science museum and you put your hand on a metal ball and your hair sticks up straight. And you know science. So, you're okay? Indubitably. They used props, they used visual aids and they just made us look like dopes. Idiots! God, what are we going to do? I don't know. I don't know. Because you know what our killer is? Depression. Wolves. Depression. Visual aids. Yes. A quilt. A depression quilt. No time to sew a quilt. I got it. Get me the number for the Giant Big Box Toy Store. You may be asking yourself what am I doing on a trampoline? Well, I thought I'd bounce here for a while, relieve some stress and then move on with my day. Not. Here's a plan. Dwight is going to gather all of the office workers and all of the warehouse guys and we're going to have another safety seminar. Only this time, where's Michael? Oh, my God, he is on the roof. And now I have got their attention. I tell them about the cold hard facts of depression. And then I say, "Hey, you ever seen a suicide?" And I jump. And they freak out. And they get to see the dangers of depression with their own eyes. Nice side note, they might think, "Hey, I should have been nicer to Michael. " But that's not why I'm doing this. Then I land on the trampoline, take a couple extra bounces for fun. I climb off, walk around the corner, ta-freaking-da. So then the next movie moves to the top of the queue. So number five becomes number four, number six becomes number five, number three becomes number two, etcetera, etcetera. And let's just say that I just sent back Love Actually, which was awesome. And they sent me Uptown Girls, which is also awesome. But guess what, now I want to see Love Actually again, but it's at the bottom of the queue. Oh, no, what do I do? What I do is this. I go online, I go click, click, click and I change the order of the queue, so that I can see Love Actually as soon as I want to. It's so easy, Ryan. Do you really not know how Netflix works? I guess I forgot. You're such a ditz. Ryan, well done. Two minutes, 42 seconds. Additionally, Pam, you win $10 because she said "awesome" 12 times. And Jim, you win $5 because she mentioned six romantic comedies. Okay, let's do this thing! I'll go summon the troops! Maybe we should test this first. Letterman style. Throw a TV over or We measured it once. Go buy some watermelons. Seedless? Just Creed is eating an apple. I found a potato. Hey, Creed. Hey. Yes! Here you go. What? Nice! I don't know this place as well as I thought I did. I'm getting cleaned out. Ready? Let's do it. Drop that sucker. Yeah! Bingo! Deactivate the car alarm, clean up the mess. Okay. Find out whose car that is. If it's Stanley's, call the offices of James P. Albini, see if he handles hate crimes. Got it. Also, take apart the trampoline. Stick it in the baler. We're not allowed to use the baler. Have Padge do it or the sea monster. I'm on it. I'm temporarily lifting the shun. Thank you. It means nothing. I need you to do something for me. Anything. Okay, calm down. I need you to acquire an inflatable house andlor castle. You mean a Moonbounce. What do you think? You've got an hour. I'm going to need petty cash. Shunning resumed. Do you want a drawbridge? Un-shun. Yeah, that sounds good. Re-shun. Oh, yeah, this is much better. It's safer. Excellent decision. Yes. Thank you for seeing that. When you land, try and land like an eight-year-old. These bouncy castles are not designed for adults. I don't know if I want to do this. Want to do another test? I got plenty of watermelons in my trunk. No. No more. The tests are going terrible. If we keep doing them, I'm not going to want to jump. This is about doing, not thinking. Right! Doing! Totally doing! Let's rock and roll! Rock and roll! Yeah! That's right, I'm not thinking! Yes! Yeah! Michael is awesome Jumping off the roof Bouncing on a bouncy thing Show them who is boss Rip a hole in the sun! I am ready to do this! I'm ready to make a point! Hey! Guys, listen up, Michael is up on the roof and acting strange. What's the situation? Un-shun. I think he's suffering from depression. Re-shun. Okay, when is the shunning thing going to end? Un-shun. Never. Re-shun. I think he wants you all to come out to the parking lot and watch him die. Is it nice outside? It's gorgeous. Let's go! Do I need my jacket? No, it really is. It's very nice. Come on! Will I be too warm in a long-sleeved tee? Everyone's going to be fine in exactly what they're wearing! Let's go! Let's go! Come on! Hurry up, you guys! My life! Oh, my life! Michael, what's wrong? Everything's wrong. The stress of my modern office has caused me to go into a depression! Depression? Isn't that just a fancy word for feeling bummed out? Dwight, you ignorant slut. Depression is a very serious illness. Over 32,000 people commit suicide every year according to a 2004 study. Is that the last year the data was available? Yes. My head is in such pain and turmoil. Don't do anything rash. Dwight, where are the warehouse guys? I didn't I didn't think you needed them for this part. Okay. That's You said to just That's the whole point, dummy. Okay. I'm on it. Okay? Attention, blue-collar workers! What are the odds that this is in any way real? I'd say, like, 10,000 to one. Okay, I'd like 10 bucks on those odds. If someone gives you 10,000 to one on anything, you take it. If John Mellencamp ever wins an Oscar, I am going to be a very rich dude. Michael is up on the roof and he's acting strange. Oh, my life. Michael, what's wrong? Everything is wrong, Dwight. The stress of my modern office has made me depressed. Depressed? Isn't that just a fancy word for feeling bummed out? Dwight, you ignorant slut! Well, you know, the first performance was a little off, but I really think they hit their stride in the second show. I might even bring my parents tomorrow to the matinee. And that is why Oh, excuse me. It's my favorite part. I am going to jump off this roof! This is just offensive. At least we're outside. Hey, check it out, there's a castle over there. Oh, my God, there is a castle. No. There's nothing to see over there, people. There's nothing to see. They found the castle, Michael. Damn it! Oh, God. Oh, my God, he's going to jump. He's going to kill himself pretending to kill himself. Yeah. Excuse me. Hey, Michael, don't jump on the bouncy castle. You can't do that 'cause you're going to get horribly, horribly injured. Hey, Michael, I have a present for you but you have to come down and get it. What is it? Come down and open it and you'll see. Dwight, find out what the present is. Okay, I don't see anything. She might be bluffing. Dwight. Dwight. It's a A Repliee-Q-One-Expo female robot. They're only available in Japan. Dwight, you are such a liar. Pam, really what is it? Mike, this is the opposite of safety. You jump, you're going to seriously hurt yourself. You told me that I lead a A cushy, wimpy Nerf life. Yeah. But I never said you had nothing to live for. What do I have to live for? A lot of things. You What about Jan? Lovely, lovely, lovely Jan, man. It's going good, right? It's complicated with Jan. And I don't know where I stand or what I want. The sex isn't nearly as good as it used to be. Mike, you're a very brave man. I mean it takes courage just to be you. To get out of bed every single day, knowing full well you got to be you. Do you really mean that? I couldn't do it. I ain't that strong and I ain't that brave. I'm braver than you? Way braver. You Braveheart, man. I Braveheart. I am. Come on down, okay? Okay. Pam, I'm coming down to get my present. An office is as safe as the people in it. And sometimes those people can drive you to do crazy things to show the dangers of the office. That's the danger I found myself in today. I saved a life. My own. Am I a hero? I really can't say, but yes. It's kind of blurry. That's better. Question, what kind of bear is best? That's a ridiculous question. False. Black bear. Well, that's debatable. There are basically two schools of thought. Fact, bears eat beets. Oh Bears, beets, Battlestar Galactica. Bears do not What is going on? What are you doing? Last week, I was in a drug store and I saw these glasses. Four dollars. And it only cost me $7 to recreate the rest of the ensemble and that's a grand total of $11. You know what? Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery. So I thank you. Identity theft is not a joke, Jim! Millions of families suffer every year! Michael! Oh, that's funny. Michael! Yes, I understand. Can I transfer you to customer relations? Absolutely. I couldn't be more sorry about this I know, I know. We're all trying to get to the bottom of it. Yes, I'm upset. Don't I sound upset? Okay. It is disgusting. I totally agree. Well, we're going to be recalling all of that paper. We have a crisis. Apparently, a disgruntled employee at the paper mill decided that it would be funny to put an obscene watermark on our 24-pound cream letter stock. Five-hundred boxes has gone out with the image of a beloved cartoon duck performing unspeakable acts upon a certain cartoon mouse that a lot of people like. I've never been a fan. Everybody in here, stat. No time to lose. Cri-man squa, F and C, double-time. "Cri-man squa"? Crisis management squad. "F and C, double-time"? Front and center. Twice as fast as you would normally go. Any other questions? One more. Why are you talking like that? To save time, Jim. Actually, I think you could make the argument that it wastes time. Yeah, she has a good point. I mean, for example, with the last thing you said, by the time you explained it Okay, okay, okay it actually took up more time. You know what? Forget it! Where is Creed? Creed. Here. Quality assurance. Your job. I really think you screwed the pooch on this one, Creed. Because of you, the entire company is in jeopardy. Every week, I'm supposed to take four hours and do a quality spot-check at the paper mill. And of course the one year I blow it off, this happens. We have a lot of angry customers out there. This puts us at threat level midnight. Accounting, you are on customer service duty today. That's not really our job. Midnight, Oscar! Don't worry. Kelly will be training you first. Kelly's training us? This day is bananas B- A-N-A-N-A-S This day is bananas B- A-N-A I don't have a headache. I'm just preparing. Jim. Big fire in your house. Your client, Dunmore High School, sent out their prom invitations on this paper. Went home to all the kids. Yeah, I got a call in already. No, no, no. Not good enough. This is a keystone account. I want you in the school in person. All right. I want you to bring a partner. I'll go. No, sweet cheeks. We need somebody who's actually made a sale. Andy, you go. William Dolittle at your service, a. k.a. Will Do. Yeah, I'm definitely going to go alone. No! No! I need two men on this! That's what she said. No time! But she did. No time! Guys! Get on this! Dwight, I want you to be in charge of the press conference. Yes! You are entering the no-spin zone! We're having a press conference? No, Pam. The press is just going to find out by themselves. Not. Here's the thing, when a company screws up, best thing to do is call a press conference. Alert the media and then you control the story. Wait for them to find out, and the story controls you. That's what happened to O.J. I have invited Barbara Allen, one of our oldest clients, to come in here and meet with me for a personal apology. The press wants a story? I will give them a story. Oh, did the press ask for a story? Here is your headline, "Scranton Area Paper Company" "Dunder Mifflin Apologizes to Valued Client. " "Some Companies Still Know How Business is Done. " Okay? Battle stations, everybody! Let's go! Go! Go, go, go, go, go! Yes. Hello. Creed Bratton, quality assurance, Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. I was supposed to meet with one of your floor managers last week for a quality inspection, and he or she wasn't there, and I'm trying to remember who it was. Who wasn't there last week? Debbie Brown. And which day was that? Wednesday the 11th. Perfect. The only difference between me and a homeless man is this job. I will do whatever it takes to survive. Like I did when I was a homeless man. Look, I know the reason that you guys became accountants is because you're not good at interacting with people. But guess what? From now on, you guys are no longer losers. So give yourselves a round of applause. I wonder how many phone calls you're missing while you're teaching us to answer calls. I know, right? Probably a lot. Can you just tell us what we need to do so we can go? Okay, Angela, I love your enthusiasm! All you need to know how to do is pick up the phone and say, "Customer service, this is Kelly. " Except don't say, "Kelly. " Say your own name. Or if you're bored, you could just make up a name. Like, one time, I said I was Bridget Jones And I talked like this for the whole conversation. Oh! Can I be Australian, mate? Absolutely! Hello, mate! I like ice cream. I need a boyfriend. I like ice cream, too, mate! Alligators. Dingo babies. Beer me. What's that? Hand me that water. I always say, "Beer me. " Gets a laugh like a quarter of the time. So how's what's her name? You know her name. Who? Karen? Yeah. She's only one of my oldest friends. How's the apartment hanging? It's fine. Nice. Check out this sunshine, man. Global warming, right? Today was supposed to be really cold I bet. What about music? You have any music? Yeah, you should have said so. Give me the beat boys and free my soul I want to get lost in your rock and roll and drift away Give me the beat boys and free my little ol' soul I was thinking more like a CD or A CD? Your call, dude. My girlfriend made me an awesome mix. Beer me that disc. Lord, beer me strength. So, Tuna, when we get in there, let's do a really good job, okay? Did that really need to be said? Well, not everything a guy says needs to be said. Sometimes it's just about the music of a conversation. What the Why is my girlfriend here? Oh, she that teacher in the white? No, she's a part-time frozen yogurt chef. Which one is she? The one in the green hoodie. Wow. I wonder if she's like a guidance counselor or something. No. I don't think so. She's, like, probably a tutor Nope. She probably teaches No. There's no Okay, press conference in 45. Dwight, make sure this place looks nice. On it. Okay, Karen, Ryan, Pam, center stage. Pam, run a comb through your hair. First rule in roadside beet sales, put the most attractive beets on top. The ones that make you pull the car over and go, "Wow. "I need this beet right now. " Those are the money beets. Hey. Look sharp. Hey. Hi. Hello, Dwight Schrute. Hi. And you must be from the Washington Post. Scranton Times. Chad Lite, Lighter Side of Life. And breaking corporate news. And obits. Oh, dear God. Okay. Here are your credentials. You've been granted level three security clearance. Don't get too excited. That's out of 20. Right this way. Regional Manager Michael Scott will be addressing the client in the pressroom shortly. Have a seat. Can I get you a beverage? Yeah, I'd like a Great. Oh. Andy, you know what? We don't have a lot of time, so we should probably Jamie! Andy Oh What are you doing here? Andy? Are you a student here? Oh, yeah. You never told me you were in high school! This is weird. I got to go to Spanish. Oh, my God! Oh, my God. I had no idea. Well, that's not going to hold up in court. We didn't do anything illegal. Except knock over a mailbox with her friends. Sir Yes, you have a valid point Okay. and I'm sorry. Yes. No, I am so sorry. Really? Dixon City? I have an aunt in Carbondale. Excuse me? Well, I don't see how that's our fault. And I've already told you the official position of Dunder Mifflin is apologetic, so I don't know what you want from me. Okay, first, I just want to say that you are doing so good. Look, you have so many good qualities, that the one that you might want to work on is apologizing. When I went over Wednesday for the spot-check, I get a call from Debbie Brown saying she has an emergency dentist appointment. Emergency dentist appointment? Now I'm told she told her manager she had the flu. I'm a trusting guy, but I just wish Debbie Brown had been there. We would've caught this. Yes. I'll be sure someone returns your call. I'm so sorry. Bye. Hello, I'm looking for Michael Scott. Mrs. Allen is our most important client. Because every client is our most important client. Even though she's a pretty unimportant client, really. And so, with the eyes of the nation upon us, I would like to say that Dunder Mifflin truly regrets this unfortunate incident. And as a gesture of gratitude for your continued loyalty, Mrs. Allen, I would like to present you with this novelty check for six months of free paper or You look good in this. So, let us consider this matter ended. Well, it isn't ended. I'm very angry. I could have lost business. I know. I know you are angry and we are truly, truly sorry. I don't accept your apology. The watermark was obscene and horrifying. Well, we are extremely sorry. I don't accept. I'll be with you in a moment. All right. Who was that guy she was talking to at her locker? Not important because you're not dating her, because it's a felony. But who was that guy? Probably another high school student. The issue with the watermark is very serious. Absolutely. We teach our students that character counts. And you should. You don't teach it well enough. One of your students is a bitch. Know what? Andy is having a real rough day today. I want to take out an ad in your yearbook. Full page, two words. "Good luck. " That's not what I had in mind. Ask where he's from. Absolutely. Where are you from? Ohio? That's nice. So what do you want? He's upset about the watermark. Okay, great. Now, just tell him that it was an unfortunate error and we are doing everything we can do to fix it and that you're sorry. It was an unfortunate error. We're fixing it. And you already got your money back. And you're sorry. And the company has already apologized, so you can take that apology or not. I think he had Tourette's or something! We are going to do everything humanly possible to ensure that this never happens again. Well, it doesn't help. Why? Because it already happened to me. The watermark, it's a one-time thing. I don't care! It was disgusting. Cartoon characters having sex? May I point out that the sex appeared to be consensual? Both animals were smiling. Okay. I grew up on a farm. I have seen animals having sex in every position imaginable. Goat on chicken. Chicken on goat. Couple of chickens doing a goat. Couple of pigs watching. Whoever drew this got it exactly right. What can I do for you? All right. For starters, I think that you should resign. Okay. Well, wasn't really my fault. The guys at the paper mill You're the head The guy at the paper mill's No, no, no. You're the head of the company! I'm the head of the company? Yes, and that makes it your responsibility No, I'm a regional manager! and so you should lose your job! No What? Okay. This is insane. You can get out of here. Get out. That's insane. Fine. I will give this to somebody who will appreciate it. It's non-transferable. Doesn't matter. Out please! I'm calling the Better Business Bureau! Yeah, well I'm calling the Ungrateful Biatch Hotline! Did you get all that? Everything. We've gotta do something. This is all spinning out of control, Pam. This is just not It's just the Scranton Times. No, then Newsweek picks it up and then CNN does a story about it and then YouTube gets a hold of it. You know what? I really think the whole thing is just going to blow over in like a week or two. You're right. It will blow over. But it's not going to take a week or two. Do you know what this is for? Yes. Michael likes me to run the camera when he makes his apology videos. He says he needs a woman's touch. Okay, I think that's good. Hello, I am Michael Scott, regional manager of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. By now, you're probably sick of hearing about Dunder Mifflin and our embarrassing watermark boner. Let me tell you something. Something from the heart. I am not leaving this office. It will take a SWAT team to remove me from this office and maybe not even then. You could never withstand a SWAT team. That's how devoted I am to this job. I'm just saying I know. They would flank you, throw in a concussion grenade. I understand that, Dwight. You'd be on the ground Do you think you're taking it a little  blind, deaf, dumb. literally, Dwight? If you wanted to be And now we're wasting tape. I'm going to have to cut this all out. Can you say cut Cut.  so I'll know where to Cut. I'm asking Pam to do it, please. Cut. Okay. Ready? Kevin, what's four plus seven? Eleven. Yeah, well, you didn't know that when you filled out this payroll form. Yeah? Well, at least I didn't suck at customer relations. Oh, yes! Facial. Yes. You two are apes. I expect you to apologize for that, Angela. I'm sorry that you're both morons! Oh, but you still said, "I'm sorry. " I called you morons. Still said it. Still said it, so Five, four, three There is no way I will resign. It wouldn't be fair. Not to the good workers I work with, not to my clients, and especially not to me. Let's not forget who this whole resigning business is about anyway. If I could leave you with one thought, remember, it wasn't me. They're trying to make me an escape goat. If I am fired, I swear to God, that every single piece of copier paper in this town is going to have the F-word on it. The F-word. You have one day. One day for what? That's They always give an ultimatum. Okay. Good? Cut? Cut. That was your best apology video ever. I thought so, too. I got a farewell card for Debbie Brown. I thought maybe you'd like to sign it. Maybe throw a couple of bucks in there. Unfortunately, she's got some children. I feel terrible about Debbie Brown. She got fired because of Dwight. So I thought I'd pass around a goodbye card. Maybe everyone could put in a couple of bucks to help her through these difficult times. Why do bad things always happen to the good people? It's tragic. It is just tragic. You want music? I don't care. Come on, man. Just give it a couple of days. I think you'll be all right. Yeah. You know what? I don't Sweet. Pam. Hey, Dwight. You look really nice today. I look like an idiot! Hey, Karen. Hey, Dwight. Looking sharp. Yeah, that's 'cause I'm your boyfriend, Jim Halpert. Hey, Karen. Wanna get together later and have sexual intercourse 'cause you're my girlfriend? Do you? No. Okay. I'm good. Thanks. Look at that. I'm Jim Halpert. Spot on. A little comment. Hey. Hey. Oh, what's this? That is a demerit. "Jim Halpert. Tardiness. " Oh. I love it, already. You've got to learn, Jim. You are a second in command, but that does not put you above the law. Oh, I understand. And I also have lots of questions. Like, what does a demerit mean? Let's put it this way. You do not want to receive three of those. Lay it on me. Three demerits, and you'll receive a citation. Now, that sounds serious. Oh, it is serious. Five citations, and you're looking at a violation. Four of those, and you'll receive a verbal warning. Keep it up, and you're looking at a written warning. Two of those, that will land you in a world of hurt, in the form of a disciplinary review, written up by me, and placed on the desk of my immediate superior. Which would be me. That is correct. Okay. I want a copy on my desk by the end of the day or you will receive a full desaggelation. What's a What's that? Oh, you don't want to know. Hey, Phyllis. Are you all right? I think I just got flashed. What? Really? In the parking lot. Oh, my God. Move! Okay, I'll call the real police. What happened? What can I do to help? Okay. I'll check the web. Thank you. The police are on it. They say they've already had three calls. Can you tell us what happened? I was walking to the building and this man asked me for directions. And he was holding a map. And when I walked over, he had it out on the map. Phyllis. You're a married woman. The guy was just hanging brain. I mean, what's all the fuss? If that's flashing, then lock me up. It's just, like, so creepy. Yeah. What's happening? Oh, some guy exposed himself to Phyllis in the parking lot. Really? Is she okay? Yeah. Bob Vance took her for a walk to calm down. Okay. Phyllis, you say? What is so funny? I mean, did he even see Pam? Or, Karen from behind? I'm guessing not. I'm sorry. It's pretty funny when you think about it. Not really. No. It's disgusting and demeaning. Oh, okay. Masters of comedy, a guy dropped his pants. Have you ever been to the circus? Okay. He's back! Okay. Hey, what's going on? There's a police car in the What? What's going on? Oh, Phyllis got flashed. It's I don't think laughing about it is an appropriate response. Oh, come on. We're laughing at Phyllis but she's not even here. So, no harm, no foul. I don't think the women in this office Incidentally, where were you during all of this? Maybe you're the flasher. I was at a parent-teacher conference. Prove it. Let's see your penis. I You know As that was coming out of my mouth, I knew that it was wrong. In all the excitement, I forgot that my primary goal is to keep people safe. Women can't have fun if they don't feel safe. For example, Jan and I have a safe word in case things go too far. Foliage. And if one of us says that word, the other one has to stop. Although last time, she pretended she didn't hear me. Michael, come over after work tonight, okay? I miss your body. I don't know. I feel I drive a lot. I'm spending a fortune on gas and tools. Okay. I'll give you $200. And if I get up before you, I'll leave it on the dresser. That I don't know. That makes me kind of uncomfortable. $300? Well I don't know. Look, whatever. Just let my assistant know if you're coming over so he can get more vodka. Okay? Hunter, are you on? You got it, Jan. The employees of this office are very small and delicate. Deserve protection from local pervs. Better a thousand innocent men are locked up than one guilty man roam free. I am sick over this thing. Those people out there are clearly afraid. And that can't happen. Not in my house. Agreed. Let me show you what I've been working on. There are several penises there I'd love Phyllis to run her eyes over. You know, see if we can catch this pervert. This is the last thing that Phyllis needs to see right now, Dwight. Look at that one. Dwight, are those your pants? That's a Polaroid. Attention, everybody. Dwight has something he would like to say. Due to a recent incident involving Phyllis, a man, a map, and his penis, I think you know what I'm referring to, Michael has authorized me to form an emergency anti-flashing task force. Question. Won't that interfere with your other task forces? Answer. No, because this is being given priority one. This is a petition for the business park to upgrade their security cameras as well as install two floodlights in the parking lot. And I know what you're thinking. Won't that just shed more light on the penises? But that is a risk we have to take. Pam. You can draw, kind of. Why don't you work with Phallus on drawing a picture of the exposer that I can post around the community? Phallus? Phyllis. Sorry. I've got penises on the brain. Back to work, everybody. I don't often miss Roy, but I can tell you one thing. I wish someone had flashed me when I was with Roy. Because that would have been the ass-kicking of the year. Especially if it had been Jim. He would not have wanted me to have seen Jim's I'm I am saying a lot of things. I didn't really get a good look. That's okay. I don't feel like answering phones. Hey, did you guys see this memo that Dwight sent out? "Women will be sent home if they wear makeup "or heels exceeding one-quarter inch. "Females are not allowed to speak to strangers "unless given written authorization by Dwight Schrute. " This is ridiculous. Attention. I am removing all bananas from the kitchen. Dwight, this memo that you distributed is insulting. Desperate times call for desperate measures. "Sleeves down to the wrists"? "Button-up collars and muted colors. " Nobody dresses like that. Okay. You know something, Dwight? We are not the terrorists. Why don't you just take these women, put them in a burlap sack, and hit them with a stick? Because that's what you're doing. I celebrate these women. They deserve the right to dress as they please. If Pam wants to show more cleavage, she should be able to. I encourage that. Look, it's really simple. We just want you guys to treat us with respect. See? That's what we're talking about. Did you hear that, Dwight? Yes. Did you hear that, Michael? No, Dwight. Respect. R- E-S-P-C-T. Find out what it means to me. All right. You know what? That's it. Conference room. Five minutes. Women's appreciation. Wait a second. How are you qualified for that? Oh, I don't know, James. Did I come from a woman? Have I slept with a woman? More than one? Less than three. That is not current. You know what? Why doesn't Oscar run the meeting? He's a homosexual. Why don't you run the meeting? You play with dolls. Those are collectible action figures. And they're worth more than your car. You know what? I am the expert. I will conduct it. I know the crap out of women. I would like to apologize for all the men who thought this was a laughing matter. Are we still discussing this? I say again, what is the big deal? Nobody likes to be flashed. When Meredith flashed me at that Christmas party, I nearly vomited. I don't remember doing that. What a surprise. Okay. No catfights. Please? Let's My point is My point is A penis, when seen in the right context, is the most wonderful sight for a woman. But in the wrong context, it is like a monster movie. Alien. What? Shut it. Shut up. Okay. So, what I want to engage us in today is a hardcore discussion about women's problems and issues and situations. Magazines and TV shows and movies portray women as skinny, tall goddesses. Well, look around. Are women like that? No. No, they are not. Even the hot ones aren't really that skinny. So, what does that say? That says that you women are up against it. And it is criminal. Society doesn't care. Society sucks. I don't even consider myself a part of society. F.Y.I. Because I am so angry over all of this. If it were up to me, you ladies would be the fashion models. Yes, Andy. Then, the fashion models could come here and work with me. What you're saying is extremely misogynistic. Yes. Thank you. That was not necessary, but I appreciated it. And it proves my point. Women can do anything. I'm saying that you're being sexist. No. I'm being misogynistic. That is insane. I am not being sexist. That's the same thing. Michael. Yes. When I got my hair cut short, you asked me if I was a lesbian. Because That was one possible explanation as to why you got that haircut. And when we get mad, you always ask us if we're on our periods. I have to know whether you're serious or not. I wish I could menstruate. If I could menstruate, I wouldn't have to deal with idiotic calendars anymore. I'd just be able to count down from my previous cycle. Plus, I'd be more in tune with the moon and the tides. Can we just get back to work? Yes. Okay. Yes. This is not work talk. You're right. You're right. And you know why? It's because of where we are. This is a masculine environment. We need to find a place where you feel comfortable. You know where we're gonna go? Steamtown Mall. Frankly, it's kind of insulting. But I have a bunch of stuff I need to return in my car, so I can do that. Malls are just awful and humiliating. They're just store after store of these horrible sales people making a big fuss out of an adult shopping in a junior section. There are petite adults who are sort of smaller who need to wear, maybe, a kids' size 10. Okay! Let's go, ladies of Dunder Mifflin. Hey, we should have a calendar printed up. Pam, put that in my good idea folder. Let's go! Are you finished with the sketch? Yeah. Doesn't seem like the type. Phyllis got a good look. I plan on plastering this pervert's face everywhere. You can run, but you cannot hide. Meredith, slow down! We're not gonna get there any faster if we're dead. Thanks. I know how to drive. Oh. Yeah. You really shouldn't litter. My car. My rules. Hey, Jim. You want to go in the women's bathroom? No. Thank you, though. You aren't curious? Not really. I've seen a bathroom before. Yeah, but, it's every guy's fantasy. I think you mean a girl's locker room. And in the fantasy, there's usually girls in it. Yeah. I'm going in. Go crazy. Oh, my God. I really appreciate your letting me work alongside you so closely today. Of course you do, moonface. That's because you're a preppy freak, you're the office pariah, and nobody likes you. So, start hanging these all around the building. This guy looks like a real deviant. No duh. That's why we've got to catch him. Start hanging those. Aye, aye, Captain. More like, aye, aye, General. I don't think she's gonna make it. Don't think she's gonna make it! It's a little too tight. I'm gonna find another spot. Many women are competent drivers. Okay. Come on. This is what we know. Well, I stand corrected. This is pretty cool. Yes. Hey, where did you decide to take Karen tonight? Anna Maria's. What's the occasion? Six-month anniversary. What? Nothing. I think, we all kind of thought you guys were just, like, hooking up. No. We've been dating for six months. She might mention an e-mail that I wrote a while back. Oh, right. I remember that one. She read it to me. She said she's not really ready to date somebody in the office, but she really likes you as a friend. I figured. That's cool. I wouldn't want to be in an office relationship, anyway. All right. I hope nobody's on a diet. Thanks, Michael. Thank you, Michael. You're welcome. You're welcome. Okay. So. Let's dish. What do you want to dish about? Anything you guys want. This is your time. What is a Pap smear? Or is it shmear like cream cheese? Okay. New topic. Kelly, how are things with Ryan? Awesome. Awful, I mean. But, sometimes awesome. What What do you think of role-play? It can be fun. Yeah? Well, Jan has this schoolgirl fantasy. That's a pretty common one. I just I feel uncomfortable wearing the dress. Okay. I'm gonna be at the doll store. Sometimes the clothes at GapKids are just too flashy. So, I am forced to go to the American Girl store and order clothes for large colonial dolls. Michael, you shouldn't do anything that you're uncomfortable with. Jan says anything that doesn't scare us is not worth doing. I don't know. Maybe we're different people. I like cuddling and spooning and she likes videotaping us during sex. Oh, my God. And then, watching it back right afterward to improve my form. That is not healthy behavior. No. It's not that bad. The worst part is that she shows it to her therapist and they discuss it. Michael, you need to get out of this. No. She's just fooling around. It's a woman thing. No. Normal women don't do stuff like that. This is bad. No. No, that's all right. I'm okay. I'm okay. You guys, what am I gonna do about Jan? Done. Read the pros first. Okay. "Jan is smart, successful. "Good clothes. Hot. "Perfect skin. Nice butt. " She does have very nice clothes. Okay, okay. Cons? Cons. "Wears too much makeup. "Breasts not anything to write home about. "Insecure about body. "I'm unhappy when I'm with her. "Flat-chested. " What was the last one? She's totally flat. Shrunken chesticles. No. The one before that. "I'm unhappy when I'm with her. " Michael. You shouldn't be with someone who doesn't make you happy. I'm happy sometimes. When we scrapbook. Or right towards the end of having sex. Look, most relationships have their rough patches. You just have to push through it sometimes. Yeah. That's smart. Maybe. But it sounds like you're just wrong for each other. That sounds good, too. I don't know who's right. I just don't. I don't know. I don't know. I bet you know. Don't think. Just answer. What do you want to do about Jan? I want to break up with Jan. Wow! I want to break up with Jan. My mom taught me that. Wow! I cannot believe this yogurt has no calories. No one said it has no calories. Oh, hey, guys. I want to do something nice for you, because you did something so nice for me earlier. I want you to go in there. I want you to buy one item, on me. As a thank you. Come on. Get in here. Let's face it. Most guys are from the Dark Ages. They're cavemen. And they like a woman to be showing her cleavage and to be wearing eight-inch heels. And to be wearing see-through underpants. But for me, a woman looks best when she is just absolutely naked. This is so great, huh? We should do this much more often. I think we hang out an appropriate amount of time. What are you doing in here? This is the woman's room. You're in here. I pay for that privilege. Okay. I'm a pretty normal guy. I do one weird thing. I like to go in the women's room for number two. I've been caught several times, and I have paid dearly. You don't want anything? My treat. Some panties, or Like, a thong or G- string, T-back? Get a nice bra. Padded bra. See-through? Push-up? Lace? Thigh-high? Bustier? Anything. It's just You know what? I would love to buy you a fresh set of underwear. Phyllis? What do you think? Too much? Jim's gonna love it. I'm kind of in between boyfriends right now, so I don't need anything sexy. But I do need some new hand towels. I figure I can cut up this robe. Slower. Slower. Meredith. Slow it up. Oh, no. It's Jan. What do I do? Answer it. Don't answer it. Okay. It stopped. Oh, crap. That is pretty cool. Michael? You know how to change a wheel, right? Yeah. Yep. Can somebody grab me the lever? And I will Here. Meredith? Why don't you put your hazards on? Yeah. Get your hazards on for safety. Let's see. There we go! Good. Yes. We have the All right. I think I've got it. Do you have a Crescent? A Crescent-Allen? I don't think we really need that, Michael. You know what? I'm going to You take care of that. I'm gonna do traffic detail. You know? I changed a tire today. All by myself. This bathrobe's already coming in handy. Coming! Think we'll find him? Yeah, I do. Because justice never rests. Halvsies? No. Wholesies. Listen, man. I really appreciate you letting me shadow you today. I feel like I learned a lot. Natch. Yep. If you don't mind, I think I'll hang up some of these posters around my neighborhood, schools, post office, et cetera. You know? I may have underestimated you. You're not a total ass. Okay. I am really going to do this. Good luck, Michael. You know what? I need my girls with me. Pam, Karen, even Phyllis. Come on. Let's do this. Let's do it. Okay. Remember. Be strong. I love you guys. No, I'm getting her voicemail. Don't leave a Hey, Jan. It's me. Michael. I'm just calling to say that I think we need a little break. Permanently. And, I know everybody says this, but I want to remain friends. Or, at least, business associates who get along. Oh. Just so you know, it's not me. It's you. Okay, buddy. Somebody just walked in. I have to go. So, I'll talk to you later. Michael. I was I was really unhappy with our conversation earlier. And I I just I couldn't stop thinking about it, so I decided that I would drive down here and apologize to you in person. So I'm sorry. Thank you. So, we're good? Abso-fruitly. Oh. Hold on. Sorry. No. Wait a second. Oh. It's from you. Want to grab some dinner? Hey, Jan. It's me. Michael. Yeah. Okay. I'm just calling to say that I think we need a little break. Permanently. And, I know everybody says this, but I want to remain friends. Maybe some Italian. Or, at least, business associates Chinese? get along. Oh. Just so you know, it's not me. It's you. Okay, buddy Any man who says he totally understands women is a fool. Because they are un-understandable. There's a wishing fountain at the mall, and I threw a coin in for every woman in the world and made a wish. I wished for Jan to get over me. I wished for Phyllis a plasma TV. I wished for Pam to gain courage. I wished for Angela a heart and for Kelly a brain. Michael. How can you appreciate women so much but also dump one of them? You mean, how can I be so illogical and flighty and unpredictable and emotional? Well, maybe I learned something from women after all. Dunder Mifflin Paper I Sex Predator Hotline.

Okay, everybody up. Circle around. Let us play some games. We are situated on the northeast corner of scenic Lake Scranton, America's eighth-largest indigenous body of water. It is here that a group of Americans will undergo the ultimate challenge. One day, fourteen strangers who work together, but only one survivor. What? Just words. Inspiring words. Not a contender. For the competitions, you will be divided into four tribes. Each tribe will have a leader that I will pick randomly off the top of my head without thinking. Jim, Dwight, Andy, and Stanley. Yes! Choose your tribes. Except for Pam, not Pam. Jim Halpert. Karen. Pros: Smart, cool, good-looking. Remind you of anybody you know? Cons: Not a hard worker. I can spend all day on a project, and he will finish the same project in half an hour. So that should tell you something. I choose Michael! I'm not playing. Okay. Temp. Dwight is an obvious candidate for my job. He has the best sales record in the office. He loves the work. He is, however, an idiot. We are going to choose team names. Dwight.

Okay, I apologize for yelling at you. That's what being a good captain is about. I'm trying to bring team spirit! It's about listening to your team. Whoa, stop. Another hole. Take a big step. I am not hysterical. I am explaining Yes! Oh, my God. You ass. There's nothing better than a beautiful day at the beach, filled with sun, surf and diligent note-taking. Pam, you're missing things! Let's go! Let's go! Come on! Mush! Mush! Come on, you bastard! What the Damn it, temp! Great job, everyone, that was fantastic. Okay, Pam, I have another little project for you. Does it have to do with these shopping bags filled with hot dogs? Smart as a whip! Yes. These are pre-cooked, so it's not absolutely necessary, but I would appreciate it if you could heat up 800 hot dogs for a little contest I'm going to be having. I would greatly appreciate it. When's the contest? Like, 10 minutes? How am I supposed to get Thanks a bunch. A good manager has got to be hungry. Hungry for success. Okay, who's hungry? No, no, no, do not touch the food. Please, not yet. That is our next event. A hot dog-eating contest. Oh, God. For those of you who are curious, the world record is 54 and one half hot dogs. Wow. And you know what? I personally have cooked up enough so that each and every one of you could break that record. So shoot for the stars, okay? All right! The team that eats the most hot dogs in 10 minutes will be declared the winner! On your mark, get set Can I have a turkey burger? No. I have the only one. I claimed it. Ready? Turkey is a healthy meat. Yeah, it's very good for you. I don't eat meat, Michael. I'm not gonna eat this. It has L-tryptophan. Guys, guys. Come on What's L-tryptophan? Please! Let's just Okay, it's very important that you all try to eat as many hot dogs as you can. On your mark, get set, eat! Is there any mustard? No mustard! No mustard! Just eat it! Eat it, Phyllis. Dip it in the water so it'll slide down your gullet more easily. Come on, the winner gets a big, big prize. What is it? I can't say. You can't say? Or you can't pronounce it? The winner gets regional manager salary for a year and a Sebring and the feeling that they're making a difference in the world. Can we just take those first two things? The winner of today gets my job. Okay? I'm interviewing for a job at corporate. And they're only interviewing a handful of people, and I'm the most qualified, and I'll probably get it, all right? You're leaving? I didn't wanna tell anybody. I didn't wanna cast a pall over our fun Beach Day. But you know what? I don't know who to recommend, because, frankly, nobody's stepping up. I am so hungry. Do you expect me to believe that you're truly making your recommendations on this basis? Word. Here we go. Let's see it. I would rather work for an upturned broom with a bucket for a head than work for somebody else in this office besides myself. Game on. Come on. Come on. Four seconds. Three, two, one Stop your eating! And the winner is Andy Bernard Team USA! with 14 hot dogs! One came up. Thirteen hot dogs, everybody. Damn it! Nobody told me we were gonna have hot dogs. Sabotage. What? What are you saying? Did you say sandwich? No. I was saying that before. Not now. Now I am saying sabotage. The ancient Dutch art of screwing up your own team. I knew you were saying sabotage. I was giving you an example of it. I will misunderstand everything that Andy says until he goes insane. If Michael organizes some kind of group hug, stand next to me. It's very simple. There are only three rules. You must not touch the ground. You must not step outside of the ring. And you must always wear the safety mittens. We don't have any safety mittens. Probably left them in the trunk of my car. It's all right. Here we go. Get him, big boy! And go! Come on, Jim! Come on! What are you doing? Come on! Stop. Nice, Stanley! Sorry about that. It's all about taking points away from Dwight. Yeah. No. Good. Okay. Oh, my God. I have never seen that look in a man's eyes, ever. I thought that I might die. On Beach Day. Come on! Come on! Come on! If either of these guys are put in charge of the office, I will transfer to Albany. Gil can come if he wants. I'm kind of looking for a way out of that relationship, anyway. I think I might try girls for a while. Angela thinks I can cross over. We'll see. One, two, three! Yeah! Yeah! Excellent! Gryffindor! Gryffindor! Come on! I didn't win. But the only reason I didn't win is because I recently learned that it's better to work things out with words. That's not why you lost. Yeah, it is. I totally could have kicked your butt. Oh, yeah, right. Yeah, right. Yeah, right! Come on, come on! God! How do you like that? Help. Help! Angela! Angela, hey. Oh, thank God. Go tell somebody. What, Andy? Andy, what should I tell them? Go tell them I'm floating away, obviously. I don't understand what you want from me. Angela, it's pretty simple. Look at what I'm doing and go tell somebody it! Sorry! Bye, Andy! Angela! I knew that finding a successor would be difficult. I did not know that it would be impossible. Thus far the candidates have been wildly disappointing. Jim is not taking it seriously. Stanley is having a stroke. And Andy, where is he? Where the hell is Andy? Where is he, Pam? Do you know? Who's ahead in points? I think they're even. At various times you gave Jim 10 points, Dwight a gold star, and Stanley a thumbs-up. And I don't really know how to compare those units. Well, check to see if there is a conversion chart in that notebook. I really doubt it, Michael. Please, just check. Great. Yeah, I'll see you next week. Thank you. And here is Karen Filippelli. Bye. Hello? Yeah, hi, David. Yes, I would like to be considered for the corporate position in well. "In well"? As well. How would that work, in well? I just want to know. Yes. Wait a minute. That would be fine. If this job is in a well, I don't want it. I don't. What does a great manager need most of all? Courage. How so? I mean, sure thing. That sounds smart. I can't do this anymore. I'm going to sit in the bus. Your loss, Stanley. Meanwhile, the rest of us will have a super-fun time defeating our fear and creating a lasting memory walking through fire! Who among you has the guts to replace me? Let him walk across these coals. Are you gonna try it? I'm not gonna walk in the fire after your disgusting feet have gone through. Angela, it is a million degrees. I'm gonna do it. And I fully expect to burn my feet and go to the hospital. That's the right spirit when doing a coal walk, right? No, no. Not you, Pam. You have to keep score. I'd like to try it. Pointless. But I'm not kidding, I really wanna do it. Okay? This is about guts. It takes guts to be a regional manager. Jim, you're up. Nope. Why not? Come on. Oh, 'cause I don't want my feet to get burned. You do not have what it takes to be a regional manager. That's harsh. Who's next? Andy, where is Andy? Andy is never here today. Hello? Who's there? My name is Andrew Bernard, I was with a group called Dunder Mifflin. Hello? Why don't you go, Michael? Because I already did. Remember? I burned my foot on the George Foreman Grill. That is not the same at all. If you're gonna ask other people to do it, you should do it yourself. All right, okay. All right. Fine. Okay. Okay. Go. The mind has to wrap around the foot. Okay. You want us to count to three? Yes, count to three, please. Three, two, one! Three, two, one! Count the other way. Go. No, no. Count one, two, three. Okay, okay. Not three, two, one. One, two, three. One, two, three. Go! Do it! Go, Michael. Wait. Am I going on "go" or am I going on "three"? On "three". On the "go" that's after "three". Okay. One, two, three, go! One, two, three, go! No! It's okay. I will do this, Michael. Don't, Dwight I will walk and stand on these coals until you award me the position of regional manager! Wow. Yes. Dwight. Dwight. Dwight. Keep moving if you're gonna walk there. Keep moving! Keep coming. Give me the job! That's enough! Give me the job! I'm not going to give it to you! Don't kneel on the coals! Oh, my God! Michael, do something! God, that stinks! Dwight, stop it! Being a boss is also about image. I've never looked like that. That was gross. I just I don't see the connection between a fire walk and management. Worst $75 I ever spent. You know what? If I had to pick my replacement based on today, it would be Mr. Outside Hire. Or Mrs. Outside Hire. Yeah. True. Look, I don't I don't wanna leave this branch that I love to an outside hire. Therefore, we're going to have a 100-point, winner-take-all, sudden death, Tribal Council round to test the aspect of my job that I think is the most important, something I call the Bob Hope factor. Who's Bob Hope? God. He's He's a comedian. Oh, like Amanda Bynes. Who's Amanda Bynes? She's from What a Girl Wants. Oh, I love that movie. Yes. Kelly is right. The person to replace me has to have a great sense of humor. And they have to possess the leadership qualities of a Bynes or a Hope. So, without further ado, Jim and Dwight. Show us what you've got. Hey. I know what you're looking for, but I gotta be honest, I really don't think I should be considered as your replacement. You are being too modest. Michael, on Thursday, I'm gonna drive down and interview with David for the open position in New York. Okay, that is not funny. I am deducting 60 points from Voldemort for false pretenses. Okay, Dwight, your turn. Wow us. The Aristocrats. A man and his wife and children go into the offices of a talent agency. And the talent agent says, "Describe your act. " And the man says something really, really raunchy. And the talent representative says, "What do you call yourselves?" And the man says, "The Aristocrats. " I mean, truly repulsive acts. That is a very, very funny story. Hey. I wanna say something. I've been trying to be more honest lately, and I just need to say a few things. I did the coal walk. Just I did it. Michael, you couldn't even do that. Maybe I should be your boss. Wow, I feel really good right now. Why didn't any of you come to my art show? I invited all of you. That really sucked. It's like sometimes some of you act like I don't even exist. Jim, I called off my wedding because of you. And now we're not even friends. And things are just, like, weird between us, and that sucks. And I miss you. You were my best friend before you went to Stamford. And I really miss you. I shouldn't have been with Roy. And there were a lot of reasons to call off my wedding. But the truth is, I didn't care about any of those reasons until I met you. And now you're with someone else. And that's fine. It's Whatever. That's not what I'm I'm not Okay, my feet really hurt. The thing that I'm just trying to say to you, Jim, and to everyone else in the circle, I guess, is that I miss having fun with you. Just you, not everyone in the circle. Okay, I am gonna go walk in the water now. Yeah. It's a good day. Pam! That was amazing! But I am still looking for someone with a sales background. Flintstones. Meet the Flintstones They're a modern stone age family From the town of Bedrock They're a page right out of history Let's ride with the family down the street Through the courtesy of Fred's two feet When you're with the Flintstones You'll have a yabba dabba doo time A dabba doo time You'll have a gay, old time! Wilma! Nice. David Oh, Michael Are we all set? Isn't our interview tomorrow? Yes. I just happened to be in the neighborhood. Thought I'd drop in and say hello. Just happened to be in midtown Manhattan? Thought I'd catch a show. In the middle of a workday? No. You know what, since I'm here, let me ask you a few questions about the job. Okay. How many people are you interviewing? We're only interviewing branch managers and some lower-level company people. Ah, well, good. Out of curiosity, are you interviewing anyone who has been here longer than I have or manages more people? I don't think so. Great. One more question. When you merged those branches, who did you put in charge? I believe we put you in charge. Ah, great. No further questions. Okay, Michael. Okay. I'm really looking forward to our interview. And I'm really looking forward to working with you. I have got it made in the shade. I know this company. The other branch managers are total morons. Hey, Pam, yeah, I forgot what day the interview was. I drove to New York accidentally. Be, like, three hours late. See, I have 600 Yeah, I don't have Hey. Hey, Kev. What's different about you? You look worse. Thank you. You got a haircut. It's sexy hot. Oh. Turn around. No. Come on. No, thanks. Do it! Look at that do! What's up, Big Haircut? You are no longer Big Tuna. From henceforth, you shall be known as Big Haircut. Andy. What is it, Big Haircut? No. Sorry, I can't hear you, Big Haircut. Yep. What? Karen suggested that I get a haircut for the interview tomorrow, so that I could look presentable and not, as she so lovingly puts it, homeless. Hey. I think it looks great. Thanks, Pam. After I had my little outburst at the beach, Jim was really nice about it. He just basically said that he missed my friendship, too, and I would always mean a lot to him. And I understand where he's coming from. For the record, I am not embarrassed at all. It needed to be said and I said it and it only took me three years to summon the courage. So, thank you. Yeah? You wanted to see me? Yes. The time has come to name my own replacement. So Please hand this letter of congratulations to Dwight K. Schrute. But that's my name. "Dwight, congratulations, a-wipe. " "Don't screw the pooch. " Thank you. Okay. All right. Thank you, Michael. Okay. Thank you so much. Hey, stop crying. Thank you. Hey. Hey. About the beach It's okay. We all say things without thinking. Oh, no. It's not that. I've actually been thinking that for a long time and I'm glad I said it. I just am sorry if it made you feel weird. Oh. Okay. Pam is kind of a bitch. Hey, what if we leave tonight? Grab a bite, get a hotel room, enjoy the city a little bit? I just have so much paperwork to do. Wow. Done. Okay, let's do it. So I was wondering if Karen and I could get off a few hours early because we wanted to spend the night in the city. Why, so you can do it? Whoops. No, well, I was thinking that, actually, we can all leave tomorrow and do a convoy, you know? Convoys are really fun. Pull up next to each other, give each other the finger. Moon each other. We're going to go tonight, but we're going to see you there tomorrow morning, right? All right. All right. Your loss. Wait, how would you moon us if you were driving? Cruise control. Oh. So, Jim, who do you think is hotter, Pam or Karen? Yeah, I'm not going to talk about this now. Pam is taller. You sure? Yes. She has bigger breasts, too. Wow. But I think Karen has a prettier face. What else? Well, I mean, Pam's face is really pretty, too. It's a very tough call. Really tough call. Yeah. You know what, why don't you take the rest of the day and figure it out and then come back and tell me what you've got. Will do. All right. Yes. Hey, Pam, I've been meaning to say something to you. I really miss our friendship. That's very funny. I've never heard you talk that much. I thought it was Kelly. Are you kidding? I would never have done that. It was Patheticville. No offense, Pam. You know what, don't even worry about it. Everyone was so drunk, I bet no one even remembers what you said. I remember. I blogged the whole thing. Www. creedthoughts. gov. Wwwlcreedthoughts. Check it out. Last year, Creed asked me how to set up a blog. Wanting to protect the world from being exposed to Creed's brain, I opened up a Word document on his computer and put an address at the top. I've read some of it. Even for the Internet, it's pretty shocking. There they are, the accounting department. I shall miss your humility and your promptly printed checks. Do you think it's going to be weird working with Jan in New York? No. Not at all. I haven't talked to Jan since we broke up. And I think if she had something to say, she would have called me. Maybe you should talk to her before No, no, no, no. You know what, it's a done deal. I basically have the job already. There's nothing she can do to stop it now. I already sold my condo. Michael. What? Why? I'm sorry that just doesn't make sense. Yes. Why Who gave you that advice? Yeah, Michael, you should never I sell your condo. I have to buy another place. But you said you were in debt. I'm not. You're not sure that you have the job. I sold it on eBay. The buyer was very motivated as was I. It went for 80% of what I paid. Sold in record time. How would you like to spend the night with the regional manager of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton? No, Dwight, I don't care if that's how they consolidated power in ancient Rome, I'm No, no. Not Michael. Me. I'm taking his job. Not now. Goodbye, Kelly Kapour. Jim, Jim, Jim. Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim. Oh, hey, Dwight. I am going to be your new boss. It is my greatest dream come true. Welcome to the Hotel Hell. Check-in time is now. Checkout time is never. Does my room have cable? No. And the sheets are made of fire. Can I change rooms? Sorry, we're all booked up. Hell convention in town. Can I have a late checkout? I'll have to talk to the manager. You're not the manager? Even in your own fantasy? I'm the owner. The co-owner. With Satan. Okay. Just so I understand it, in your wildest fantasy, you are in Hell and you are co-running a bed and breakfast with the Devil. Yeah, but I haven't told you my salary yet. Go. $80,000 a year. Once I am officially regional manager, my first order of business will be to demote Jim Halpert. So I will need a new number two. My ideal choice? Jack Bauer. But he is unavailable, fictional, and overqualified. I will see you at the interview. Yes, you will. Who is D. Abramson? He's from that company in Pittsburgh. Michael. Why are you here? How are you? I'm good. How are you, Janet? I'm I'm great. It's good to see you. Can we Can we talk privately for a minute? Why privately? I just I don't I don't like the way that we left things. Okay, sure. Fine. Why don't you wait in my office? I have some important business matters to take care of. Okay. Okay. Pam, DEFCON 10. Houston, we have a problem. What do you want me to do? I may need some immediate assistance. If you would slowly and quietly gather the ladies in the conference room, Phyllis, Angela, Karen. What about Meredith? No. She's an alternate. So, how you been? I'm good. Good. Good. Good. Yeah. Sorry to drop by unexpectedly. I I tried calling, but I kept getting voicemail. Weird. Yeah. I didn't get both of your messages. So, Michael needs us in the conference room. Oh, is it Jan again? Hey, before I leave tonight, would you mind making half a dozen copies of Jim's and my sales reports for our interviews tomorrow? Sure. Thanks. I really hope you get the job. Thanks. After you ended everything with us, I went on a vacation to kind of clear my mind. Sounds good. Sounds fun. It was. Yeah, it was good. I think I should just Get right to the point, you know. Okay. I I feel good about myself for the first time in a really long time, and I've made some big changes in my life, and I miss you. I want us to get back together. Would you excuse me for a second? Oh. DEFCON 20. She wants to get back together. What are you going to do? I don't know. That's why you're here. Help me. Please. Would you want to get back together with her? No. No. What do I do? Just don't get back together with her. What if she makes me? How can she make you get back together with her? She made me do a lot of things I didn't want to do. This was a terrible relationship. You were not happy when you were with her. I wasn't. You're so much happier now. Just go in there and be strong. You're right. You are absolutely right. I need to go in there and tell her that we can't be together. Right. Wow. Do it. I'm in a very good place right now. Okay. Thank you. Go. Okay. Jan, we need to talk. Jan is in a different place right now. And it is a sign of maturity to give people second chances. So I'm going to hear her out. Oh, my God. Yeah. Bigger actually. That's crazy. Oh, my God. Can you believe that? Unbelievable. Wow! She could put the cup right there. I know. No, it's fine. I'm sure it must have been weird for Jim when Roy and I were joking around that one time. I would never do that. Waste of money. In my experience, guys are way more attracted to the back of you than to the front. I love fake boobs. Oftentimes you find them on strippers. I find it offensive. Au naturel, baby. That's how I like them. Swing low, sweet chariots. So, there are a lot of things I would like to do differently. Yeah. I feel like when we first got together, that I had a problem with my priorities. First stop, priorities. And if we could talk about a way to approach a possible reconciliation. Let's get back together. No. No, no, no. I'll tell you this, it is not because of the boob job. Excuse me, boob enhancement. That would be shallow. And this is the opposite of shallow. This is emotionally magnificent. Okay, everyone, listen up! Time to begin the interview process. Andrew Bernard. Save the best for first. All right, you guys, see you later. Wish us luck. No. Hey, hey, do not wish them luck. Do not wish them luck. All luck must be wished unto Michael. Good luck, you guys. Good luck. What did I say? Good luck. Thanks. I'm happy for him. I hope he gets the job. I really just want him to be happy. And I know that sounds cliche, and I know saying it sounds cliche sounds cliche. Maybe I'm being cliche. I don't care because I am what I am. That's Popeye. I am going to begin this process with a simple test of intelligence and mental dexterity. What is the best color? White. Because it contains all other colors. Wrong. Black. It is the most dominant. How do you make a table? You make a chair, but you don't sit on it. What is the capital of Maine? The capital of Maine is Montpelier, Vermont, which is near Ithaca, New York where I went to Cornell. Okay, also, moratorium on Cornell talk. Don't want to hear about it. Forget your personal history and learn the history of this company. Should not be a problem. I minored in history in the Ivy League school which I attended. You're not off to a very good start, Bernard. I agree. But in another way, I am off to a very good start, wouldn't you say? I am a great interviewee. Why? Because I have something no one else has, my brain, which I use to my advantage when advantageous. Time! No, you failed. Damn it! This interview is over. I'll let you know. Hey, thank you so much for driving me down for my interview. Totally. No problem. What are you interviewing for, by the way? My assistant? Or Oh, you know, I'm going to have a congratulations Karen party tomorrow night at a friend's house. Oh, wow. That sounds fun. Is your friend named Karen, too? What did she accomplish? No. I'm sorry, I should have been clearer. It's for me. Oh. Because I'm going to get the job. How remarkable. Thanks. Wait, wait a second. Oh. Let me check one more thing. Okay. Very good. All right, well, I have to get back. But I will see you in New York tomorrow, right? Yes, indeed. Good luck with your interview. Thank you. Bye. So I guess we're getting back together. What happened? Your advice was good, but Jan's was bigger. Here's the sitch. Two weeks ago, I was in the worst relationship of my life. She treated me poorly, we didn't connect, I was miserable. Now, I'm in the best relationship of my life with the same woman. Love is a mystery. So, we have all night. Where do you want to go first? I don't know. How about the UN? How often do you come here? Every time my sixth grade class was on a field trip. I think you're really going to enjoy this, adult Jim. Hey, everybody, the next time you see me I will be working for corporate. Starting tomorrow, Dwight Schrute will be running the branch. So without further ado, I would like to start saying my goodbyes. For everything you've done You know I'm bound Okay. I'm bound to thank you for it Good night and good luck. Who's ready to work? Yeah. We went to the Spotted Pig for dinner. It's in the Village. Karen knew it. And then we second acted Spamalot. That's when you sneak in at intermission with all the smokers. And then we went to a bar that used to be a church. Oh, and at this one bar, I swear I saw Lorne Michaels. That wasn't him. So what's going to happen with us when I get this job? Oh, you mean, when I get the job? Well, if you get the job, then I'd move here with you. Would you move with me? I'm not stupid, okay? I was at the beach. We don't have a future in Scranton. There's one too many people there. You mean, Kevin? Exactly. No, but you get it, right? I can't stay there. Yeah. I do. Come on. How are you guys doing? Need anything? No. We're good. Thanks. I have been here a bunch of times, so I know where everything is. Know everybody's names. If you need to know somebody's name, just ask me. Well, who's that? That is Beardy. Beardy? I'm going to introduce myself. No, no. That's not his real name. That's just what I call him. So I am by far the most qualified person they're interviewing. Jim and Karen are here, which is cute. They're like kid actors tagging along with Daddy on the big audition, hoping to be discovered, except Daddy is the best actor around. Daddy is Meryl Streep. Michael is gone. Hail to the chief. My first order of business, make Andrew Bernard my number two. My first order of business, accept. As if you have a choice. Duh. Opportunity of a lifetime. Three months ago, I was nowhere. I was just a Cornell grad in anger management. Look where I am now. Not bad. Hey, Hunter. What's up, my brother? This is Hunter, secretary extraordinaire. Administrative assistant. Jan in yet? I think she's coming in later. Could you give her a message for me when she gets in? Sure. Just say I want to squeeze them. It's code. She'll know what it means. Okay. Oh, Hunter, could you tell her also? You showed great leadership potential at the coal walk, even if you did follow it with that embarrassing personal confession. Thank you. I had to make Andy my number two. It's political, complicated. You wouldn't understand. I want you to be assistant regional manager. Really? Well, in a sense. Although, publicly, I am going to retain the assistant regional manager position. You will be your own assistant. Correct. I need someone I can trust. But I would also like the title to be secretly applied to you. Just stripped off its pomp and frills. Okay. So you would be the regional manager and the assistant regional manager, Andy is your number two. I would be the secret assistant regional manager. Let's call it secret assistant to the regional manager. Do you accept? Absolutely I do. I learned from Jim, if Dwight ever asks you if you accept something secret, you reply, "Absolutely I do. " Hello, hello! Michael, good to see you. Good to see you. Have a seat. Here are the post-merger performance tests that you asked for. Great. I've been meaning to thank you, by the way. You didn't lose a single customer in the merger and you still managed to trim the budget. That is nice work. So, let me ask you a question right off the bat, what do you think are your greatest strengths as a manager? Why don't I tell you what my greatest weaknesses are? I work too hard, I care too much, and sometimes I can be too invested in my job. Okay. And your strengths? Well, my weaknesses are actually strengths. Oh. Yes. Very good. There you go. Very good. Dwight is our new boss. No, Michael's not going anywhere. Then who do you think will get the job? Karen. She looks corporate. Those little pantsuits. I think it's going to be Michael. Do you really think he's qualified for that job? No, but he wasn't qualified for the job he has now and he got that one. Yeah. Listen up. Come to the center of the room, please. This is a Schrute Buck. When you have done something good, you will receive one Schrute Buck. One thousand Schrute Bucks equals an extra five minutes for lunch. What is the cash value of a Schrute Buck? Excellent question, Pam. One one-hundredth of a cent. So, 10,000 of your dollars is worth one real dollar? Just Zip your lid. Another announcement. Michael wasted an enormous amount of the group's time and patience with non-work-related ethnic celebrations and parades of soft-minded do-goodedness. No longer. No more meetings. Amen. Instead, today I will begin my first lecture in a long series of lectures designed to increase your knowledge on the world of paper. Do we have to? Yes. Michael is gone. There's a new sheriff here in these offices and his name is me. Conference room, 10 seconds. All of you! I literally cannot wait until I see what Dwight has planned. And I wish Jim were here. What do you think we can be doing better? I've never been a big fan of the name Dunder Mifflin. I was thinking we could name the company something like Paper Great or Great Paper's Our Passion. We're great. I don't know. It could be good. Or Super Duper Paper. It's super duper. I don't know. Something like that. Okay. Okay. Thanks for coming in, Michael. Thank you. It is always a treat when our paths cross. It is always a treat when our paths cross. So, oh, before I forget, I wanted to let you know, if you hadn't already heard, Jan and I are back together. So I may need to fill out one of those love documents again. You're back together. Yes. And I am very excited about the prospect of working under her. Or on top of her. That's not sexual. Just We're all professionals. Okay. Well, I thought it was clear in the description of the position. The job you're applying for is Jan's job. I don't understand. So we're going to tag-team it? No. We're letting Jan go. Listen up. Let's start from the ground up. Where does paper come from? Trees. Trees. And where do trees grow? Soil. Forests. Right. We have in front of you here seven different types of Pennsylvania topsoil. Now, what would you say is the most important element in the production of aboveground leafy growth? Probably phosphorus, right? Wrong. It's nitrogen. Absorb this information. Good. Now, let us discuss precipitation. Stanley, when rainfall occurs, does it usually fall in a liquid, solid, or gaseous state? Liquid. Very good. You have earned one Schrute Buck. I don't want it. Then you have been deducted Make it 100. Well Don't you want to earn Schrute Bucks? No. In fact, I'll give you a billion Stanley Nickels if you never talk to me again. What's the ratio of Stanley Nickels to Schrute Bucks? The same as the ratio of unicorns to leprechauns. Okay. That's it! Class is canceled. Everybody out! No, wait, what are you doing? I'm punishing them. No, no, no, no. Class is not canceled. This is so stupid. Hey! Come on! Let's listen to Dwight's presentation. What What are you winking for? Zip your lid! So that's my basic five-year plan and then after that who knows? Okay. Now, this may seem like an odd question. Yeah? What do you think about Michael Scott? He's a very nice man. And he's very well-suited for the job he has now. This is off the record. He would be a disaster. Hey, you. Hey. How was your interview? Pretty good. Yeah? Could have gone better, I guess. Oh. Well, I will put in a good word for you. Cool. Maybe you should do it sooner rather than later. What? Let's just run away together. Let's just run away to Jamaica, live in a bungalow. You have some savings, right? You can pay off my debts. It would be fine. We'd have fun. What's What's the matter? What What happened in there? I can't tell you. Tell me what? You son of a bitch. Jan, this isn't the time. I'm in an interview You're firing me? Where the hell do you get off? Frankly, it's overdue. Your behavior in the last two years has been completely erratic. Erratic? Recently you don't even show an interest in your work. You smoke constantly in your office, you spend most of the day online shopping. You disappear for hours at a time, sometimes days, always saying you're visiting your sister in Scottsdale. You go to Scranton far more often than you Is it because of these? Whoa, hey, whoa, Jan. Come on Is it No, I want to know! I want to know! Because if it is, then Then I will see you in court. It's not. It's not. No. Because he likes them, okay? He likes them. And that is That is all I care about. The time has come for you to end your professional relationship with this company. You are clearly unstable. Hey, you're unstable. Yeah. No. We're all unstable. Okay, do you know what? I'm just not leaving. I'm not leaving. I'm not leaving. David, I did not tell her. It's like I'm staring into my soul when I look at this wall. It's like outer space without the stars. It's so black. This is going to look so awesome. It's so intimidating. Anyone who comes in here is going to have to take me seriously. Abandon all hope ye who enter here. Totally! Bye, Hunter. Bye. Good luck with your band. Oh, thank you Don't let them change you, okay? So long So I am going to give her a ride home. Let me know about the job. Actually, Michael, I think we're going to take it in another direction. Good. I'm glad we're on the same page. I have a lot of ideas for new directions. No, we're not giving you the job. You know what? That is actually good because I don't think I could take my girlfriend's job. That's not being a good boyfriend. So I respectfully withdraw my name from consideration. Do you accept my withdrawal? I do. Good. Very good. I'm glad we are finally on the same page. Still have my job in Scranton, though? Yes. Good. That's all I ever wanted. These two, either one of them, excellent candidates. Wow. That was some serious, hardcore self-destruction. Yeah. I kind of feel bad for her, though. Don't. She's nuts. Oh, man. You know what, this might take a while. You really don't have to stay if you don't want. Okay, good because a bunch of my friends are meeting downtown for lunch and I was going to meet them. So All right. Just call me when you're done. Sure. Good luck, Halpert. Thank you. Dunder Mifflin, this is Grace. Sure. Oh, God. I mean, I just don't understand. It's just so rude, you know. I know. I know. I mean, the absolute nerve of that guy. I am sorry about that. That was terrible. Oh, just No, actually, I think it's good. You know, it's fine, actually. I do. I really think it's great that it happened because, you know, my work has always been the thing that's gotten in the way of my happiness. So Yeah. Well, it's No, don't cry. It's going to be okay. Oh, I know. I know. It's just I'm sorry. It's just these painkillers that I started taking since the surgery. Oh, they make my moods totally unpredictable. Wow. What am I going to do? I don't know. Well, I guess you could come and stay at my condo. I think I could back out of the sale. Oh. I would probably get some negative feedback on my eBay profile, but Live together. Actually, wait a minute, this could be great. This could be perfect. You know, my full-time job can be our relationship. I can wear stretch pants and wait for you to come home at 5:15. It could work. This could work, really. I'll be back. And I am back. How did it go? No, no, Pam. I'm back for good. Kevin Nealon. Everybody, may I have your attention please? It is with great honor and privilege that I announce to you, I have officially withdrawn my name for consideration from the corporate job. I know, I know, I know. Michael, what are you thinking? You were a shoo-in. Well I got down there, I nailed the interview and the strangest thing happened. Why is my office black? To intimidate my subordinates. That's stupid. It was Andy's idea. You shouldn't have taken it. Bad management. Good thing I'm back. Ryan, coffee. I don't do that stuff anymore. No. It's for me, bimbo. Kids. So I'm back and I am never, ever, going to leave. I am going nowhere. This place is like the hospital where I was born, my house, my old age home and my graveyard for my bones. Did Karen get the job? Back to work. Still waiting on that coffee. Pam, hello. Dwight, hello. I wanted to thank you for helping me when you held the title of secret assistant to the regional manager. You served the office with great dignity. No, I don't know what the future holds. But I'm optimistic and I had fun goofing around with Dwight today. Jim and I are just too similar. Maybe one day I'll find my own Karen. But, you That is a You know, not A man. A man version. But until then I can hold my head up. I'm not gay. I don't know how I feel about hiring a Sixers fan. I should leave. Now, let me ask you a question, Jim. You're clearly a very bright guy. Thanks. Always hit your numbers, personable. You make a great impression on everyone you meet. I'm sorry, wait. So is the question, how did I get to be so awesome? Because I don't have an answer for you. Oh, hey, do you have your quarterly numbers Yes. Absolutely.  and questionnaire? Sorry to make you fill that thing out. Oh, no. Absolutely. It's just a HR formality. We have this very irritating HR guy here. He's probably the only person you're not going to like. Kendall. So, first up. There you go. How do you think you'd function here in New York? What's that? Oh, great. You know I just I really appreciate the buildings and the people, and there's just an energy that New York has. Not to mention they have places that are open past 8:00, so that's a bonus. You've been in the Scranton branch a long time. What have you liked most about that place? The friendships. Okay. Well, we want the person who takes this position to be here for the long haul. So, long haul, where do you see yourself in 10 years? How are your feet? Medium rare. Thanks. The real reason that I went to Stamford was because I wanted to be Not here. I know.

And I'm sure we'll stay friends. We just We never got the timing right. You know, I shot him down and then he did the same to me and But you know what, it's okay. I'm totally fine. Everything is going to be totally Pam. Sorry. Are you free for dinner tonight? Yes. All right. Then it's a date. I'm sorry. What was the question?
