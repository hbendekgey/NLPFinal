They don't know what they're looking at, so I make suggestions. Just keep talking to her. If you hit a stall, you have a fall-back. - What's that? - You buy a purse. - I don't want a purse. Purses are for girls. - That's not true. Do you read GQ? - No. - I do. They're like mini briefcases. Lots of guys have them. - Like those? - Yes.

I wanted to ask your permission to ask out Katy. - I know it's against the rules. - It's not against the rules. She is not a permanent employee, so it's not. Thank you. I appreciate this so much. But you should know that I am going to be giving her a ride home later. What? She asked me for a ride, so I'm going to give her a ride home. Is that all it is? Just a ride home like a taxicab? Well, it might be a ride home. It might be a ride home and we stop for coffee and dot, dot, dot. Please. Please. I am your inferior and I'm asking you this favor. Can you promise me that it will just be a ride home? No. I cannot promise you. You cannot promise me or you won't promise me? Listen, Dwight. Do you love her? No. I don't know. It's too early to tell. I I don't know how I feel. You've made a good choice. She's going to like that. Espresso. - Thank you. - You're welcome. There you go. Mm-hm. Mmm. Is that from the machine in your office? Mm-hm. Isn't that the prize for the top salesperson? Very easy to clean. OK. Like he's gonna win anyway.

Cos Roy's got a truck. - That's cool. - Uh-huh. - Yes. - That is cool. - I'll see you Monday, though, right? - Great. OK. I'm gonna head back. All right.

And I still know their names in the morning. MICHAEL: Tonight is the Dundies, the annual employee awards night here at Dunder Mifflin. And this is everybody's favorite day. Everybody looks forward to it, because, you know, a lot of the people here don't get trophies very often, like Meredith or Kevin. I mean, who's gonna give Kevin an award? Dunkin' Donuts? Plus, bonus, it's really, really funny. So I You know, an employee will go home and he'll tell his neighbor, "Hey, did you get an award?" And the neighbor will say, "No, man. I mean, I slave all day. "Nobody notices me." The next thing you know, the employee smells something terrible coming from the neighbor's house. The neighbor's hanged himself due to lack of recognition. So, you ready for the Dundies? (SIGHS) PAM: You know what they say about a car wreck, where it's so awful you can't look away? The Dundies are like a car wreck that you wanna look away, but you have to stare at it because your boss is making you. (HOARSELY) Hey, hey, hey! It's Fat Halpert. What? Fat Halpert. Jim Halpert. So, why don't I take you on a tour of past Dundie winners? We got Fat Jim Halpert here. Jim, why don't you show off your Dundies to the camera? Oh, I can't, because I keep them hidden. I don't wanna look at them and get cocky. Oh, that's a good idea. And mine are at home in a display case above my bed. Yuck! TMI. TMI, my friends. TMI? Too Much Information. It's just easier to say TMI. I used to say, "Don't go there," but that's lame. And here we have Stanley the Manly. Now, Stanley is a Dundie All-Star. Aren't you, Stan? Why don't you show them some of your bling? I don't know where they are. I think I threw them out. No, you didn't. I think I did. Why did Say, we gotta order some more appeteasers this time.

It's great. A little bit of Roy eating chicken crispers A little bit of Kim with some ribs A little bit of It was you. Live and learn. It wasn't, I swear. Yeah, it was. So, what's the joke? You're not perfect, either. We're not laughing at you, Dwight. So, who are we laughing at? Just something somebody wrote. Who, Dave Barry? No, no. Just something that was written on the ladies' room wall. What is it? Who wrote it? It's kind of private. It's about Michael. (LAUGHING) That is defacement of company property, so you better tell me. Kelly, if you tell me, you'll be punished less. Okay, now I'm laughing at you. (PAM LAUGHING) Will Her Highness Jan Levinson-Gould be descending from her corporate throne this evening to visit us lowly serfs here at Dunder Mifflin, Scranton? JAN: (STUTTERING) It's a two-and-a-half-hour drive from New York, Michael. Well, you could take the bus, you could work on the way here, sleep on the way home? No. Come on, Jan, this is important. I mean, this is validation to my employees here that you and corporate approve of this. So But we don't approve of this, Michael. You only have the budget for one office party a year, so we're not paying for this. Um Could you Are you there? Yeah, I'm here. I just wanted to talk to you for a second about that. MICHAEL: What What is I mean, come on, Jan. What, it's a You're dropping an A-bomb on me here. Really? I'm dropping an atomic bomb on you? Well, yeah! I mean what is What No, you can't You already had a party on May 5th for no reason. No reason? It was the 05-05-05 party. And you also had a luau. It happens once every billion years. And you had a luau. And the Tsunami Relief fundraiser, which somehow lost a lot of money. Okay, no, that was a fun-raiser. I don't really understand that. I think I made that very clear in the flyers. Okay, well, I don't understand why anyone would have Fun. F-U-N. a Tsunami fun-raiser, Michael. Well, I think a lot of people I mean, that just doesn't make sense. were very affected by the footage. This is a little character I like to do. It is loosely based on Karnak, one of Carson's classic characters. Here we go. The PLO, the IRA, and the hotdog stand behind the warehouse. (RIPPING) Name three businesses that have better healthcare plans than Dunder Mifflin. Here's the problem. There's no open bar because of Jan. And it's the reason why comedy clubs have a two-drink minimum. We'll be fine, but I just wish people were gonna be drunk. PHYLLIS: Dwight, get out of here! No, no, no What are you doing in the ladies' room? It's not what you think. No! Why were you in there? What were you doing in there? You are a pervert! I am not. The Dundie Award for Longest Engagement goes to Pam Beesly. Pam, everybody! (MICHAEL WHOOPING) When is that girl gonna get married? That's what I have to say. Ah, Roy's accepting. Yes. MICHAEL: Thank you, Roy. Are there any words you'd like to say on Pam's behalf? ROY: We'll see you next year. MICHAEL: Yeah! (MICHAEL LAUGHING) Hope not. Hope not. I'm not changing that. That's the best one. No, it's hilarious. You're right. I just think, "World's Longest Engagement," we're all expecting it, you know? That's why it's funny. Every year that Roy and Pam don't get married, it gets funnier. Well, I'd think if you use the same jokes, it just comes across as lazy. Oh, "lazy." Uh-huh. Excuse me, everyone. Can I have your attention, please? I just wanted to say that the women in this office are terrible. Especially the ones who wrote that stuff about Michael on the bathroom wall. Having a bathroom is a privilege. It is called a ladies' room for a reason, and if you cannot behave like ladies, well, then you are not going to have a bathroom. You're taking away our bathroom? We are going to have two men's rooms. But where would we go? Be prepared to hold it, folks. From 9:00 a. M Okay, okay, look PAM: Michael? Yes? Dwight's banning us from our bathroom. Okay, well, that's ridiculous. So, just don't I don't have time for this right now. There needs to be repercussions for people's behavior. Just don't talk, don't talk Okay, look, I know there have been a lot of rumors flying around about the Dundies this year. How there is no money, and how there is no food, and how the jokes are really bad. But, what the hell, everybody? I mean, God! The Dundies are about the best in every one of us. Can't you see that? I mean Okay, we can do better. So tonight, for the first time, we are inviting all of your friends and family to attend the awards with us. Yes! MICHAEL: Yeah. Not bad, right?

(SIGHING) (BOTH SIGHING) JIM: What a great year for the Dundies. We got to see Ping and we learned Michael's true feelings for Ryan, which was touching. And we heard Michael change the lyrics to a number of classic songs, which, for me, has ruined them for life. ((I'VE HAD) THE TIME OF MY LIFE PLAYING) What? Nothing. Okay. What? I don't know. What? Oh, my God! You are so drunk. Did you get that? Please tell me that you got This is all going to be on This woman is having a seizure. Grab her tongue! Grab her tongue! It's okay, I'm a Sheriff's Deputy. Well, he's a volunteer. Don't get into that now. DWIGHT: We need something to cushion her head. (SINGING PARODY) Throw pillow, a cushion Okay, I'm gonna use my shirt. PAM: Get off of me. DWIGHT: No! MAN: I'm sorry, sir, you're gonna have to put your clothes on. People are trying to eat. I can't. Was this year's Dundies a success? Well, let me see. I made Pam laugh so hard that she fell out of her chair and she almost broke her neck. So I killed, almost. Oh, my God! I just want to say that this was the best Dundies ever. (SCREAMING) Careful, careful, careful. We have a strict policy here not to over-serve. Apparently, this young woman was sneaking drinks off of other people's tables. I Xeroxed her driver's license, and she is not welcome at this restaurant chain ever again. Great work tonight. Watch your step. Excellent. Thanks. I had to check her pupils to make sure there wasn't a concussion. Yes, that, too. But, I mean, with the audio. Great work. I feel bad about what I wrote on the bathroom wall. No, you don't. Oh, here she is. Careful, careful, whoa. All right, easy. You're almost there. Hey, can I ask you a question? Shoot. I just wanted to say thanks. It's not really a question. Okay, let's get you home, drunk. All right. Bye. Good night. Have a good night. Thank you, Angela. PAM: I am actually looking forward to "Take Your Daughter to Work Day." I am not great with kids, but I wanna get better because I'm getting married. So I put out a bunch of extra candy on my desk so the kids will come talk to me. Like the witch in Hansel and Gretel. Bribery. Nice. Oh, I have more. Name's Pam. Miss Beesly, if you're nasty. Janet Jackson. Hey, you having a wardrobe malfunction there Michael, you can't be nasty today. Because of that. Oh, God. Is that today? I reminded you last night. Listen, I like kids. But this is not a kids' environment. This is like HBO. No limits. MICHAEL: Who knows what I'm gonna say? Crazy stuff. And it is "R" rated. It is not rated "G." I am like Eddie Murphy in Raw. And they are trying to make me into Eddie Murphy in Daddy Day Care. Both great movies, but still. Well, I'll be in my office. Don't you think you should say something? They're cool. Michael, I think that as the boss you should really Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine. Hi, children. I'm Michael Scott and I am in charge of this place. (MUTTERING) How do I make you understand I am like Superman. And the people who work here are like citizens of Gotham City. That's Batman. That's Batman. Okay. I'm Aquaman. Where does he live, guys? The ocean. I work with a bunch of nerds. (DOOR SLAMMING) Hello, tiny one. Come on. You are the future. This is my file cabinet. Oh, this is the partition between my desk and Angela's. Abby's my fiancee Stacey's daughter. I think she'll have a good time. I just hope she doesn't look on my computer. Actually, I better go check. Michael, you remember my daughter, Melissa. Oh, yes. Hello, how are you? Good to see you. Wow, you've really grown up. You know what? If you don't mind me saying so, she is turning into a stone cold fox. Better keep the frat boys away from her. I'm in eighth grade. STANLEY: She's in middle school. Yeah, middle school's amazing. It is extraordinary. An extraordinary time. It's not that children make me uncomfortable. It's just that, why be a dad when you can be a fun uncle? I've never heard of anyone rebelling against their fun uncle. They want how many spiral pads? Well, 50 I over-ordered because they had a back-order. MICHAEL: Okay. MEREDITH: I got permission to bring Jakey in to work. Which is great because he got suspended this week and now I don't have to pay for a sitter. Will you pull that down there? Okay, tell them what you wanted to say. Do you need any help? No. Thanks. We'd have to explain everything. It's probably just easier if we do it ourselves. All right, I wasn't expecting that. Let's go draw. Oh, my God. She is so cute I wanna die. Don't you just love kids, Angela? I guess I wouldn't mind a pair of small, well-behaved boys. God, I cannot wait to get pregnant and have babies. Kelly and I both agreed that we would just have fun. And I'm learning that fun for Kelly is getting married and having babies, immediately, with me. Just compare last year's order to this year's. Yeah, I'm looking at it right now. Yes. We Yeah, they're very They're different. Yeah, we can stick with last year's, we're just gonna have to supplement it, somehow. Hey, Abby, do you wanna help me shred some old documents? It's actually pretty cool. No thanks. I only have one goal today. To make one kid like me. Just one. What are you reading? From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler. Best book. Yeah, but I've read it before. So have I. Hey, question: If you had to spend the night in the Met or the aquarium, which would it be? Definitely the aquarium. Definitely. Yes. Glad you said that. You don't wanna help me with some of my sales, do you? 'Cause I'm kind of swamped. Sure. Really? Yes. And you're Abby, right? Yeah. I'm Jim. JIM: And, let's sell some paper. ABBY: All right. Let's start with your mom. Yes. Well, we can Hey, you know what? Can I call you back? I'll call you right back. Yes, I promise. Hello. Can I help you? You can pick that up if you want. That's all right. You wanna bring it over Here, I'll make some room. My name's Michael. What's your name? Sasha. Nice to meet you. Oh, you know what that is? That is a train whistle. Like I'm the conductor. But I'm sort of the conductor of the office here. Right? (WHISTLE TOOTING) You wanna try? Sure. All aboard for sales! Next stop, Kukabonga. (GIGGLES) (GROANING) You broke my hand! There is no way that hurt. Really? 'Cause she's pretty strong, Dwight. Little girl, come over here. Shake my hand. Come on. I don't have all day. I don't feel anything. Nothing. You're so weak. Excuse me. These are expensive collectors' items, okay? Do you have any computer games? No, I don't have computer games on my work computer. That would be inappropriate. Yeah, Meredith doesn't have any either. It's so lame here. You call your mom, Meredith? That's very disrespectful. Whatever, okay? You can refer to me as Mr. Schrute. That's your name? Mr. Poop? Schrute. Mr. Schrute. Sure, Mr. Poop. Schrute. Are you Mother Goose? I drink like a hundred iced macchiatos a day and practically nothing else. Wow. There's a really cool coffee place, Jitterz, at the Steamtown Mall. You ever been there? No. You've never been to Jitterz? Ryan, you are so dorky. Give me your number so I can text you. MELISSA: Come on. Do you have an e-mail address? I may be wrong, but I just thought you should know. I think something a little fishy is going on. STANLEY: A little fishy? KELLY: Yeah. I mean, I've been noticing them all day, and I just think That little girl is a child! I don't wanna see you sniffing around her anymore this afternoon. Do you understand? Yes, sir. Boy, have you lost your mind? No. 'Cause I'll help you find it. What you looking for? Ain't nobody gonna help you out there. Jesus can come through that door and he's not gonna help you if you don't stop sniffing after my child. Okay. Stanley yelled at me today. That was one of the most frightening experiences of my life. That was Greensleeves, a traditional English ballad about the beheaded Anne Boleyn. And now, a very special treat. A book my grom-mutter used to read me when I was a kid. This is a very special story. It's called Struwwelpeterl by Heinrich Hoffmann from 1864. "The great tall tailor always comes "to little girls that suck their thumbs." Are you listening, Sasha? Right? "And ere they dream what he's about, "he takes his great sharp scissors out "and then cuts their thumbs clean off." Dwight, Dwight There's a photo. What the hell are you reading to them? These are cautionary tales for kids. My grom-mutter used to read them Yeah, you know what? No, no, no, no. They No. The kids don't wanna hear some weirdo book that your Nazi war criminal grandmother gave you. What's a Nazi? What's a Nazi? Nazi was a fascist movement Don't From the 1930s in Germany Don't, don't talk about Nazis in front of You know what? They're gonna have nightmares. MICHAEL: Why don't you just shut it? I was gonna teach the children how to make cornhusk dolls. Why don't you just leave, okay? Okay. Bye, Mr. Poop. All right. There goes Mr. Poop. Now, who likes Dane Cook? I do! I do! Children cannot lie. They are innocent and they speak the truth. And out of the mouths of babes, Michael Scott is freaking cool. You know, I never misbehaved in front of my father because he was a very strict disciplinarian. I can only hope my mate has some of those same qualities. This is where the magic happens. Right over here. Let me show you this. See all these? You know what that is? That's paper. This is where paper comes from. Any questions? So, you cut the paper and dye it and stuff? No, we don't actually cut the paper. That's a good question. The paper is sent to us, cut and dyed, from a paper manufacturer. And then we sell it to a business for more than we paid for it. That's not fair. No. Yes, it is. Well No. You need someone in the middle to facilitate You're just a middleman. I'm not just a middleman. Wait. Why doesn't the sawmill just sell the paper directly to people? You are describing Office Depot. And they're kind of running us out of business. We have better service than they do. There's Creed! Let's take a look at what he's doing, everybody. This is Creed. And he is in charge of something. Right? That is correct. Say hi to the kids. Hi, kids. Have you ever seen a foot with four toes? MICHAEL: What are you doing? Stop it! Stop it! Just No, no, no, no, no! Would you cut it out? What is your problem? The hair covers it up mostly. No, no, no, we're not gonna see the four-toed Creed, okay? You know, there's something interesting about me that you might want to know. I used to be the star of a kids' show. CHILDREN: No way! MICHAEL: It's true. I did. MELISSA: You serious? I am totally serious. There was a show called Fundle Bundle and I was the star. ABBY: That doesn't sound like a show. It's true. I can prove it. I can prove it. Watch this. Ryan! Can you come here a second? (MICHAEL CLEARING THROAT) I would like you to go to my mother's house in Dickson City. And if she is at the pool, the back kitchen window should be unlocked. I want you to boost yourself up. All right. I want you to go down to the basement. In the basement is a tape labeled "Fundle Bundle." I want you to grab it. I want you to get my guitar. Right. Okay. I want you to get a tambourine. Do you know how to play the tambourine? I'm already getting the pizzas from Brunetti's, so You know, I can go with him. No! I will go. Okay. Thank you, Ryan. Good attitude. Hottest in the office. All right. Now, what kind of pizza do you like? MICHAEL: I don't get why parents are always complaining about how tough it is to raise kids. You joke around with them, you give them pizza, you give them candy, you let them live their lives. They're adults, for God's sake. I am going to give you a little blast from the past of Michael Gary Scott, when he was a child star and a show that you might remember called Fundle Bundle. MICHAEL: Okay, without further ado, Ryan. WOMAN ON TV: Fundle, are you ready CHILDREN: Yeah! Let's have some fun! That is Miss Trudy. You can't tell from the costume, but she had an amazing body. MICHAEL: Okay, you can fast-forward. And I want you JIM: Is that a real, functioning windmill? Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop. Yes! That is Edward R. Meow. That's pretty funny. Yes. Recess! Hey, what's your name? My name's Chet. Well, hi, Chet. Is that Chet Montgomery? MICHAEL: I don't know. That is! He's the meteorologist from channel 5. "Checking in with Chet. Doppler 7." ROY: That guy's legit. What do you wanna be when you grow up? I wanna be on TV. And he is on TV now! Would everybody please shut up? Please. So you don't miss it. Okay, next. So, what's your name? Oh, that's me! That's me! (ROY LAUGHING) What's your favorite subject in school? Recess. Recess. So, tell me, what do you wanna be when you grow up? I wanna be married and have a 100 kids so I can have 100 friends, and no one can say no to being my friend. Okay. Well, nice talking with you, Michael. Back to you, Miss Trudy. Hi, everyone. It's one of my favorite I could have sworn there was Did you get married? No. Why not? It just never happened. So, do you have any kids? Nope. JAKE: Do you have a girlfriend? I do okay. MELISSA: Was Chet Montgomery cool back then? Yes. JAKE: Even I have a girlfriend. Okay. All right. Okay. So, you didn't get to be what you wanted to be? I guess not. You know, I have a load of work to do. So, I am going to grab a slice of this delish pizza and I'm gonna go do my work. Bye. He's not coming out. He won't pick up the phone. I can't believe his mom dressed him like that. That's the real tragedy. Pam, Pam! I love this guy! Come on! So, Melissa, I met your mom a couple times. She's so nice. Who, Teri? That woman is not my mother. That is my stepmother. Mr. Poop, I have to tell you something. Okay. But first, that's not my name. You're ugly. Well, at least I'm not a horrible little latchkey kid who got suspended from school. So Meredith! (MOCKING) Yeah? I think these belong to you. Oh, that's okay. She can keep those. Believe me, she has enough toys. She doesn't need your watch. Thank you. Is everything okay? You have to ask me that because you work for Human Resources. That's true. You know, sure, playing the field is great. Don't get me wrong. But there's more to life than notches on my bedpost. Tell me something honestly. Do you think that it is too late for me to have kids? Well, you need a wife first. Or at least a girlfriend. What about Not Jan. Okay. If you really wanna have kids, I guess you could somehow A foster parent or something. Or biologically. Somehow. Thanks. That's No, that really means a lot to me. Hey, does Sasha have a godfather? Because Yes. Okay. Is it okay if I take one? Sure. Thank you. You're welcome. Is your job hard? It's not too bad. I get to shred things sometimes. Do you wanna see? Yeah! Really? Yeah. Okay. Here it is. Don't put your fingers in there. (SHREDDER HUMMING) (PAPER CRACKLING) Cool, huh? That's so cool, yeah! Yeah, I get to do this, like, every week. That's so awesome. I know. Yes, it is true. I, Michael Scott, am signing up with an online dating service. Thousands of people have done it. And I am going to do it. I need a username. And I have a great one. Little Kid Lover. That way people will know exactly where my priorities are at. Go ahead. Do you wanna come over for dinner tonight? Oh, man, I would love to. I can't tonight. But can I come over some other time? What are you doing? You never have plans. Thanks, Kev. I'm actually going on a date. Nice. MICHAEL: Hey, no please. You can't leave yet. There's still one more thing we need to do. (SINGING) You who are on the road Must have a code that you can live by BOTH: And so become yourself Because the past is just a good bye And teach your children well Why does he own a guitar if he doesn't know how to play. I think he thought his ukulele skills would transfer. And feed them on your dreams My theory is that The one they picks the one you'll know by Don't you ever ask them why If I told you, you would cry You just look at them and sigh and know they love you And they do. Your parents love you very much. One more time. You The Schrutes consider children very valuable. In the olden days, the women would bear many children, so we would have enough laborers to work the fields. And if it was an especially cold winter and there weren't enough grains or vegetables, they would eat the weakest of the brood. No, they didn't eat the children. It never came to that. There you go. Nice dress, Ryan. It's not a dress, it's a kurta. Okay. Tonight, one of our most ethnic co-workers, Kelly, has invited us all to a Diwali celebration put on by her community. What is Diwali, you may ask? Well, to have Kelly explain it, "It's I have It's so super fun and it's gonna be great. " A lot of gods with unpronounceable names. Twenty minutes later you find out that it's essentially a Hindu Halloween. You look so handsome. You really do. I love the material. I know. How come you didn't get me one? Okay. So, between Meredith's minivan and if I borrow Bob's Yukon that should fit about 12 people. I actually might not go. I'm feeling kind of tired. Do you want to make Appletinis and watch Sex and the City at my place? Oh, I don't know. I haven't decided yet. I don't get why you won't go. Did I do something wrong? I mean, I thought we were really close friends. I just feel kind of tired, you know? Maybe you've got mono. Maybe. I just I don't really have anyone to go with. Well, go with Dwight. He's single too, right? Yeah, totally single. Hundred percent available. Are you guys going to this Indian thing tonight? I don't know. Who's Who's going? Oh, you mean like, "Is Pam going?" Don't go. They eat monkey brains. Hey, hey, hey. Stop that. That is offensive. Indians do not eat monkey brains. And if they do, sign me up because I am sure that they are very tasty and nutritional. It's important that this company celebrates its diversity. And you know what, Stanley, come Kwanza time, I have got you covered, baby. I don't celebrate Kwanza. Really? You should. It's fun. I love the people here. And if there was one thing I don't really care for, is that they can be terribly, terribly ignorant about other cultures. And I don't want them embarrassing me in front of my girlfriend, Carole. Diwali is a very important holiday for the Hindus. But frankly, I'm a little appalled that none of you know very much about Indian culture. So, without further ado, Kelly, you are on! Diwali is awesome and there's food and there's gonna be dancing, and I got the raddest outfit. Kelly? It has sparkles Why don't you tell us a little bit about the origins of the holiday? Oh, I don't know. It's really old, I think. How many gods do you have? Like hundreds, I think, maybe more. I don't know. And that blue, busty gal, what's her story? She looks like Pam from the neck down. Pam wishes. Kelly, I'll take this one. Diwali is a celebration of the coronation of the God-king Rama after his epic battle with Ravana, the demon-king of Lanka. It symbolizes the battle All right between good and evil  all right. This isn't Lord of the Rings. Here we are. I'm sorry. I started biking to work. Josh does it and he lives a lot farther away than I do. And also it saves gas money, keeps me in shape, helps the environment and now I know it makes me really sweaty for work. Nice basket. Thank you. Now a lot of people say that Kelly is one in a million and that's true, but it's also not true, because frankly, there are literally billions of people just like Kelly in the world. Here are some famous Indians. Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar. He is a Nobel Prize-winning physicist. Impressive. Apu from The Simpsons. Hilarious Indian. M. Night Shyamalan, The Village, Unbreakable, Sixth Sense "I see dead people. " Okay. Spoiler alert. He was dead the whole time. Just stop it. What's Oh, what? Where did that come from? Karen, my chips got stuck in the vending machine again. I need your skinny little arms. Oh. Did you shake it? Yeah, I shook it, I shook it. We have such a roller-coaster thing, Karen and I. Excuse me? Roller-coastery friendship. Hot and cold, on again, off again, sexual tension-filled type of deal. It's very Sam and Diane. Wow. Yeah? From Cheers. Yeah. And another thing about the Indian people, they love sex positions. I present to you the Kama Sutra. I mean, look at that. Who has seen that before? I have, that's Union of the Monkey. Oh, that's what they call it. This is the best meeting we have ever had. Thank you, Kevin. You know, I find this incredibly offensive. Well, I find it beautiful. Well, whatever Kelly wants to do in her own house is fine, but we shouldn't all be subjected to it. No. Actually, she's right. This is inappropriate. Why don't I take these? No, you're not going to collect them. Yeah. No, this is a delightful, charming culture. My Indian cultural seminar was going great until Toby decided he was too immature to deal with culturally explicit images. It's just sex, people, everybody does it. I'm doing it with Carole probably tonight. All right, I think you guys should be all set. Oh, here's the corporate card for dinner. Thanks. Now, Karen, let's keep it to $20 a person this time. Got it. Okay. Once a quarter, the sales staff of this branch has to stay late to do order form consolidation which, amazingly, is even less interesting than it sounds. You guys ready to party? What's that? I said, "Are you ready to party!" Isn't this fun? Not wearing shoes? I wish some of us still had our shoes on. Stop it. It's a disease. I told you. I thought you said this was a costume party. What does that look like to you? An Indian woman in a sari. No one's even gonna notice. Nice outfit. Hey, Kevin. It's a costume. So you can just cool it, okay? Carole? Carole I'll have one of those as well. Thank you very much. Thank you. Now these are limes, lemons, onions I'm a vegetarian. What can I eat? It's all vegetarian. I'll just have some bread. You used your hands. Oh, yuck, oh What, is it too spicy? No. These s'mores are disgusting. They're not s'mores, they're samosas. Do you think they have any s'mores? All they are is chocolate, graham cracker and marshmallow. How difficult would that have been? So, you're Kelly's sisters, huh? What? Rupa, Neepa, Tiffany, stop acting like such little losers and just be cool! Come on, Ryan. Come on. Leave him alone! I hate you guys. They said something about Zach Braff Don't even listen to them No, you know Very official. I decided to come. I feel a little underdressed, but at least I'm not dressed like a slutty cheerleader, right? Is that mean? Temp! Temp! I don't even want to hear it, okay? Stop it. Stop it right now. I didn't come to Diwali to get yelled at. Ryan is a temporary worker. Makes no money. Vali is a whole doctor, so handsome. Makes good money Do you think I want to date a doctor? and he's a perfect match. Hey, Big Tuna, you ready? Yep. One, two, three, shot! Oh, holy mother of God Oh, that burns! Golly That's good Wow! Thirty years. And you two only met once before the wedding night? Yes. Wow. How long have you been married to the cheerleader? She's not a cheerleader! She thought this was a costume party. No, we're not married yet. She is very fair. She is very fair. Very fair and very kind. So, tell me, is your marriage the kind of thing where when you die, she has to throw herself on a fire? No, okay. It's still very cool. Okay, thanks. One, two, three, shot! Are you okay? I'm gonna be. Hi. I'm just gonna Just for a sec. Just a sec. Everyone? I'm sorry. Could I have your attention, please? Thank you. Hi. Sorry, I just have an announcement to make. Okay. I have learned a lot about Indian culture tonight, but I have learned even more about love. And I know you're all thinking, "Who is this crazy gringo and what is he talking about?" Well, I'm not crazy. Maybe I'm crazy in love. So, without further ado, Carole Carol Stills, I would like you to do me the honor of making me your husband. Oh, Michael What do you say? Can we talk about this in private? I didn't hear you? Can we talk about this in private? Oh, you gotta be kidding. Okay. No, I get it. I get it. You're not ready. We'll wait. This is our ninth date, Michael. Well, yeah. But I I feel like I've known you many lifetimes. Maybe I'm Hindu after all. Okay, I'm not Hindu, but Carole, Carole, I just I feel like I just like you so much. I'd better go. Okay? You can find a way home, all right? Yes. Okay. Okay. Okay. Good night. Good night. Hey, you know what? Why don't I come with you? 'Cause I've got this book called the Kama Sutra Okay, good night, Michael. All right. Good night. Well, I was a temp, but I got promoted. So the compensation is a lot more competitive. So you're saving money now Yes to start a family and home? Oh, or travel? And buy an Xbox. Is there anything you wanted to ask us tonight? Can you believe that my boss proposed to his girlfriend in public? That is so Michael. Is it? He's really outgoing, huh? Yeah. Hey, would you excuse me for a second? It's hot in there. How's the naan? Dry. You look like you were having fun. I am. You should come dance with us. I have to watch our shoes so they don't get stolen. Who were you texting? No one. I went to the doctor I went to the mountains I looked to the children Andy, no a cappella. I looked to the children I drank from the fountain There's more than one answer to these questions Pointing me in a crooked line Wait. The less I seek my source Oh, come on, guys, please. The closer I am to fine The closer I am to fine That's not good. Tuna! Are you kidding me? Oh, my God. Wow. That's so spicy. Here. Yeah. You're waiting for a call? No. Wow. Pam, when Carole said, "No," tonight, I think I finally realized how you must be feeling. We're both the victims of broken engagements. Well, you were never really engaged. I was in that marriage arena, though. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, well. I kind of thought something would happen tonight, too. So alike. So alike. What are you doing? What are you doing? I'm rejecting your kiss. I What? I didn't Can I have a ride home? If you sit in the back. Night, guys. Hey, can I have a ride, man? I have my bike. No way, dude. I am not driving home. I brought an inflatable bed for just such occasions. You're welcome to share it, though. It's a roomy twin. I'm good. Hey, dummy, get in the car. I'm a drunk driver. Yes, you are. Here, let me take that thing. Just get in the car. Okay. You can really hold your liquor, though, really. Yeah. You can't. Okay. And I am just going to lie down in the back, if that's all right? Sure. Here's your bag. Just don't puke on anything. You okay? So good. Good. These are not my shoes. This is just like that show Taxicab Confessions If you say one more word, I'm stopping the car. Sorry. This is going out to Indians everywhere. It's a tribute to one of the greats, Mr. Adam Sandler. Diwali is a festival of lights Let me tell you something Tonight has been one crazy night So put on your saris It's time to celebrate Diwali Everybody looks so jolly but it's not Christmas, it's Diwali The goddess of destruction, Kali stopped by to celebrate Diwali Don't invite any zombies to a celebration of Diwali Along Came Polly to have some fun at Diwali If you're Indian and you love to party have a happy, happy, happy happy Diwali! Happy Diwali!   W.B. Jones is renovating their offices and their cruise are taking up some of the parking spaces we used to get. So we had to park at a satellite parking lot over there. Which just means we get to see more of our lovely street. Tell them what we saw today, Jim. Oh, today we saw a junkyard dog attacking the bones of a rotisserie chicken. Nature. I've been here 9 years, and suddenly I'm supposed to park half a mile away. I lost a penny out of my loafers, Oscar. I will quit. As God is my witness, I will quit if this is not fixed. Some of us like the walk more than others. It hurts like hell. Episode 4x10 "CHAIR MODEL" Did you pick a new chair? It's been a while. Pam, when I first opened this catalog, I thought I was just going to be picking out a chair. But instead you found something to distract you from picking out a chair. Michael started the process of selecting a new chair about three weeks ago. And normally I wouldn't care but he promised me his old one. It's way better. It's one of these: I really want it. - Have you ever seen this woman? - Her? The one in the really great mesh, black, hi-back swivel chair? Look at her smile. It's the eyes. Look at her eyes. She's got I don't know what it is exactly. She dresses like a professional, and yet you know there is a side of her that could just curl up on a couch. Or in a great chair. Yeah, maybe, but Remember after my dinner party when I said that I was swearing off women? I definitely remember your dinner party. I think what I meant was that I am completely swearing off one woman: Jan. I think that fate put this catalog in my hands. Actually, I put the catalog in your hand 'cause you have to pick out a new chair. What is it like being single? I like it. I like starting each day with a sense of possibility. And I'm optimistic, because every day I get a little more desperate and desperate situations yield the quickest results. Ladies and gentlemen, would you please open your supply catalogs and kindly turn to page 85? - Yo, is this his new chair? - No, he hasn't picked one yet. When Pam gets Michael's old chair, I get Pam's old chair. Then I'll have two chairs. Only one to go. I am ready to start dating again. Getting back on the market. So FYI, for those of you who're thinking about fixing me up, with any of your friends, use the woman on page 85 as a template. That will be all. I left my cell phone in my car. Call us when you get there so we know you're okay. Listen, man I am completely over Jan. So would you set me up? If I had somebody to set you up with, Michael, then I'd take her for myself. - I thought you were engaged. - Nope. Stacy broke up with me. What? God, that's terrible, man. She's crazy. Um, are you still on good terms with any of her friends? Not anymore. It's a bitter situation. Yeah She's You don't deserve her. All right. Hello, Oscar Meyer weiner lover. I bet that you have a bunch of very liberal girl-type friends who trust you implicitly because they know you'd never touch 'em 'cause of your condition. - Michael? - What? I have a friend who's single. Sandy. She's gorgeous and she's got a feisty personality too. Feisty So she's not jolly or sassy? Not like a jolly, sassy opera singer? No, she's a professional softball player. - Catcher or in field? - I don't know, Michael. Is she a dress-wearer or a pants-wearer? Could we share a rowboat? Could a rowboat support her? What are you asking? I think I'm being very clear what I'm asking. Would an average-sized rowboat support her without capsizing? It bothers me that you're not answering the question. No, all right? She can't fit in a rowboat. Damn it! I knew it! I knew it, Phyllis! What is wrong with these people? I would do anything for them, and they're just hanging me out to dry. Dating shouldn't be hard for somebody like me but it is, and you know why? Because nobody here is willing to help me. Nothing would ever get done in this office without a formal request, would it? Well fine, here goes. - I don't think that - Now okay, I know that this is probably not appropriate. But I need help. Because I want to play ball with my kids before I get too old. And before that happens, I need to get laid. And before that happens, I need to be in love. And I don't wanna hear, "I don't know, I can't help, na na na." No, no, I am a catch, and I am not going to be the one who got away. So this is what we're going to do. Dwight is going to hand out index cards, and I want you all to write down the name of an eligible woman for me to date by the end of the day. No, by the end of the hour, or you are fired. Write legibly, people. Because of the construction at W.B. Jones, half of us have to park in the satellite lot. - It's, like, a 10 minute walk. - No, 30. Look, I have an assigned parking place in front, so All right, all right. Let me try to think about what it would be like to not have one. Okay, yes, that would be bad. - That would be bad. - Okay, so - help us out. - Wish I could, but I can't. Well can, but won't. Should, maybe, but shorn't. Michael, please What part of shorn't don't you understand, Kevin? Look, I could probably handle it, yes, but I think it would be a good exercise for you to do it yourselves. - We won't let you down. - You can't because I don't care. Don't forget to fill out those cards. My love cards. There's nobody I hate enough to write her name on this card. Well, I'm setting Michael up with my fat friend anyway. He can just deal with it. - Who are you putting down? - Oh, you don't know her. - Who is it? - Your mom. Yeah, whatever. Give that to me! Give that to Okay, "Wendy" Hot and juicy redhead. Let's give this a try. Wendy's. Hello, Wendy. This is Kevin's friend Michael. This isn't Wendy. Sorry. Could you put her on, please? Dude, this is a Wendy's restaurant. Damnit, Kevin. Okay Could I just have a frosty and a baked potato, please? You've to come here to order food. I'll send somebody to pick it up, just have it ready. It's ready now. Well, put it aside. - I've collected the rest of the ladies. - Good, good. Because this batch was awful. - This one says "chair model." - I wrote that. Michael, you shouldn't have to settle. This is my pledge to you. I will find her, and I will bring her to you. And as God is my witness, she shall bear your fruit. That sounds good. Go get her. Wait! First go to Wendy's, get my food, come back, and then go. That is fantastic. Thank you, thank you very much. This is just what I needed. The furniture company gave me the name of the advertising agency. They gave me the name of the photographer. The photographer, a spaniard, used a Wilkes-Barre modeling agency. The agency gave me the following information: Debrah Shoshlefski, Dead, car accident. Case closed. She's dead? She's so young. She was so young and now, she's dead. As dead as every dead animal who has ever died. God. Why don't you sit down, Michael? Come on. There we go. Michael, you didn't even know her. Try not to be so hurtful, Jim. - Jim, how dare you? - Not at time like this. Okay, Michael, you know what? I might have someone for you. Oh, really? What's her name? Burgerking? No, I mean it. She's really nice and sweet and you guys might actually get along. I don't think I'm ready Is she hot? I'm setting Michael up with my landlady. She's really sweet and Whatever, I just can't take Michael like this. No question about it, I am ready to get hurt again. We need to assemble the five families. - No, not the five families. - We have to! The five families are the five companies of Scranton business park. The bosses rarely meet. There's Michael Scott, regional manager, Dunder Mifflin. Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration. Paul Faust of Disaster Kits Limited. They call him "Cool Guy Paul". W.B. Jones of W.B. Jones heating and air. Grade a badass. And Bill Cress of Cress Tool and Die. Bill Cress is super old and really mean. Kevin, I don't have time for this right now. I'm trying to get a date with Pam's hot friend. And she needs to meet me right now. I'm calling the meeting anyway. Thank you very much. Our suspect has straight brown hair. She is wearing blue jeans and a black top. So behold our bachelorette. Give her a 10 for her looks and a 3 for her ability to describe herself. Hello, my lady. Are you Michael Scott? Is who a Michael what? I'm sorry. I'm supposed to be meeting someone named Michael. That's not Yeah, I'm not Michael? Large hot chocolate with caramel and a shot of peppermint. So you get the rent checks every month and What happens next? What You're asking me what I do with the checks that people write to me? Just making conversation. Why is it so hard to meet people? I You know, it's All I want is somebody nice, and sweet, and someone I can talk to and share an experience with, you know? Why is it so hard for people like us? I don't know. You wanna see what I walked out on? This is going to blow your mind. Look at that! - She's beautiful. - Yeah. And you can't see her whole body, down here, she has a boob job. Just She was just crazy smart and really manipulative and I don't know. Michael? Hello Well, I'm gonna head out. Well I enjoyed this conversation. It was very nice. It was like talking to the sweet, old lady on the bus. That's incredibly rude. Now you ruined it. Where's Scott? Michael Scott could not make it today due to an unforeseen prior engagement. - Let's just meet back in an hour. - Gentlemen, please. We called this meeting. Andrew Bernard is the name of me, and this is my associate, Mr. Kevin Malone. I have things. All right, what do you want? Well, first of all, I'd just like to say what an honor it is to be sitting here - with you - You've 10 seconds. We want our parking spaces back. - Whose parking spaces? - W.B. Jones's construction guys park in our parking spaces every morning, and some people have to park really far away and walk all the way to the office. And some people sweat too much for comfort and My God. I don't have time for this, guys. Just give 'em back their spaces. - Okay. - We good? Okay. Could've done this over email. After Stacy left, things did not go well for a while. And it was hard to see It's just nice to win one. Margaret the landlady? Really, Pam? Is that what you think of me? She's sweet and cute. I thought you would get along. Oh, okay. Well, I'm looking for a passionate affair, not companionship. I'm a man of intensity. Of of cool, and youth, and and passionately. God - Margaret? - I know You just got yourself kicked out of your apartment. Oh, I don't care. I don't really like that place that much anyway. - I'll just move. - Oh, really? Who's gonna take you in? You're messy. You're a klutz, you spill everything. And you leave the volume on the TV way too loud. Yeah. Maybe I'll move in with my boyfriend 'cause he's kind of a slob too. Okay. Sure. Let's do it. No, I Well, I'm not gonna I'm I'm not gonna move in with anyone unless I'm engaged. Have I not proposed you yet? I don't No. Well, that's comin'. Oh, right now? No. I'm not gonna do it right here. That would be rather lame. Okay, so then when? I'm not gonna tell you. I hate to break it to you, but that's not how it works. Oh, right. Yeah. Wait, I'm serious. - It's happening. - Okay. And when it happens, it's going to kick your ass, Beesly. So Stay sharp. I've been warned. I am not kidding. Got it a week after we started dating. I don't know, man. I was with Jan for so long I was excited about meeting somebody new. Put my heart out there. You know what you need? Closure. You're right. What do you mean though? There was a woman in your life who affected you very deeply, and she left before you could say good-bye. I think you need to say good-bye. Come on. I'll drive. - We did it! - I did it. We got our spaces back. Nice job. - Nice. - Yeah. There it is. You're welcome. Did I do this for me? No. I did this for the little guy. For Joe six-pack, the guy who wakes up every morning in his $400 a month appartment, wonders how he's gonna pay his mortgage this month. Wonders how he's gonna fill his car up with oil. Wonders how am I going to pay my kids' orphanage bills? That guy shouldn't have to wonder where he's gonna park. How did she die? I guess you could say she died of blunt force trauma and blood loss. She got in a car accident and ploughed into the sight of an airplane hangar. - God - Yeah. She was so innocent. She was stoned apparently. You know, I used to think that I had this perfect person out there waiting for me. But now I know that that's just silly. Because she's dead. What do you do? You wait till next year's chair catalogue comes out and find someone who's still alive. - You move on. - Yeah. Where do you wanna go for dinner? I don't know. I kinda hate all our regular places right now. You know what? That one Hey, Pam. Will you wait for me one second while I tie my shoe? - I hate you. - What? My shoe is untied. What is your problem? Oh, my god! You thought I - No, no, no. - How could I have thought that? Bye, bye, miss chairmodel lady I dreamt that we were married and you treated me nice We had lots of kids Drinking whiskey and rye Why d'you have to go off and die? Why d'you have to go off and die? You believe in rock'n roll? Can music save your mortal soul? And then, can you have to dance real slow? Well, I know that you're in love with him 'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym - Kicked off both her shoes - Turned off her shoes - No more rhythm and blues! - No verdict was returned! Rhythm and blues. This will be the day that I die   Here are our final actual costs for this year. As you can see, we did pretty well. Yes, I can see That we did indeed. Why don't you explain this to me like I am an 8-year-old? This is the overall budget for this fiscal year along the x-axis. - Right there. - There's the "x-axix." You can see clearly on this page that we have a surplus of $4,300. We have to spend that by the end of the day or it will be deducted from next year's budget. Why don't you explain this to me like I'm five? Your mommy and daddy give you $10 to open up a lemonade stand. So you go out and you buy cups and you buy lemons and you buy sugar. And now you find out that it only cost you $9. So you have an extra dollar. So you can give that dollar back to mommy and daddy, but guess what? Next summer I'll be six. And you ask them for money, they're gonna give you $9, 'cause that's what they think it costs to run the stand. So what you want to do is spend that dollar on something now, so that your parents think that it costs $10 to run the stand. So the dollar's a surplus. This is a surplus. We have to spend that $4,300 by the end of the day or it'll be deducted from next year's budget. We should spend this money on a new copier which we desperately need. Break it down in terms of I think I'm getting you. Jarick &amp; Collioure Episode: 5x09 "The Surplus" (1.00) Guess what, everybody? Christmas has come early this year. Oscar very smartly has discovered an extra $4,300 in the budget. Thank you, Oscar. And I have decided with that money I am going to buy a new Drum roll, please. Can anybody guess? - New chairs? - No. A new copier. Unless everybody can agree on something better? No, please. Please do not do this. Michael, new chairs. These chairs are terrible. We were supposed to get new ones last year. So we all agree to get new chairs then. - Good? - Good. Yeah, he said good. I'm good. Listen, we are a paper company. How can we take pride in our jobs if we have to put our fine paper in this wretched machine? This is not the time for one of your principled stands. Pam, you make more copies than anyone. Exactly. That should tell you how terrible the chairs are. Okay, good suggestions. All good suggestions. Let's just decide and agree upon one. I'm with Pam. Chairs. All right, so teams forming. We should really have the office's air quality tested. We have radon from below. We have asbestos in the ceilings. These are silent killers. You are the silent killer. Go back to the annex. You'll see. I've talked to Meredith, Stanley and Jim about the chairs. I know they're with me on this. Actually, I'm gonna go with copier. What? Ever since Pam and I started dating, I just feel a little weird asking her to make copies for me. So I make my own copies. And that copier sucks. Let me tell you, I But you know what? Pam and I don't have to agree on everything. Good for you standing up to Pam like that. The balls on you, man. - So Michael, what do you think? - Why me? You have to make the decision. I swallowed all your ideas. I'm going to digest them and see what comes out the other end. I'm a little concerned about some of these directions to Schrute farms. Yeah, do tell. I mean, like, "156 paces "from the light red mailbox, make a left. "Walk until you hear the bee hive." How could it be more clear? I think Andy makes an excellent point. But my biggest concern is that there's only one bathroom. We'll dig a trench. As long as it's downhill from the well, we should be fine. Nana Mimi cannot squat over some trench. We're gonna put out stumps. Come on. Let's three-way this little issue and come to a solution by the time we get to Schrute farms. How's that for a plan? We're getting married at Schrute farms, no matter what. I have looked at 12 venues. I have lost 8 deposits. And I have seen Angela naked zero times. I am not losing another deposit. I've been thinking about this whole chair/copier thing. I really think you should reconsider. Pam, I really - hate that copier. - Yeah, I know. But I really think you should reconsider. Beesly, are you threatening me? I'm not threatening you. I love you. But you should know you're on very dangerous ground. This is where you'll have your receiving line. Of course we'll clear out all the livestock and hay and such. - What's that smell? - You're gonna need to be more specific. Manure. Get rid of it. Manure covers up the smell of the slaughter house. Do you have to slaughter on our wedding day? - You want to eat, don't you? - Honey, say something. If we pay extra could you slaughter the entrees the day before? I'll consider it. See? That's how you do it! Making progress here. Darn! There's a hose out back. You were gonna get a new chair and you were gonna give your old chair to me. Remember? That never happened. I don't know. I haven't decided yet. I'm gonna grab some lunch. Wanna come? Really? Absolutely! That would be amazing. You guys going to lunch? Mind if I join? Best lunch ever! - Let's do it. - All right! - Where we going? - I have no idea. So I guess that's how they're gonna play this. It is on. It is so on. Look, I really need this new chair. I mean seriously. How is it possible that in five years, I've had two engagement rings and only one chair? Michael, that is hilarious. - Is somebody making fun of me? - The best! Great food. Great friends. Thank you, Michael. I got you some tiramisu. So no hard feelings. That's cool. Good stuff. - You look really pretty. - Thank you. - You got a second? - I do. Good. - That must've been so fun. - It was fun. We had a good time. Have I told you you look really nice today? Yeah, is that a new tie? No, I got it at TJ Maxx, $4. That is amazing. You think that's good. Check out these pants. - $9. - What? $9. The boys department. Look at the ass. Check out the ass. - No way! - Look at that. I guess Oscar and Jim were talking your ear off about the new copier. They were. Here's what I was thinking. Everyone sits on a chair every day. But not everyone Sits on a copier. Or even uses the copier every day. - Yeah, right? - Very valid. - That's it. - OK! See you later. Hot tie guy. Have you made a decision on the butter sculpture? I haven't thought of it. Cow, goat or sheep. It's not that hard. I would like a cat. Cats don't make butter. I would like a cow butter sculpture of a cat. It doesn't make any sense. I'm telling - I want a butter sculpture of a cat. - Cow, goat or sheep. What is this? All right. We're all on the same team. Is it Damn, why is that in the kitchen? You might want to consider changing teams because we would We would love to have you. No, copier's great. - I have my copies. - There they are. - And I have my original. - You got it. So suck it. Michael, I got you a hot chocolate. - I hope that's okay. - Oh, thank you, my dear. Wait, Michael. Let me open the door for you. Chivalry is not dead after all. - There he is! - There he is! Good to see you. There's that ass. Don't take it away! I almost choked. Here's another place. It's beautiful. So Why don't we try this out? We'll see what would happen. Give it a little test drive. What do you say? You pretend to be Angela's father. You will play Angela, and I'll pretend to be you. That way you can see what it looks like when you're up here. Hello, I'm Angela Martin. - And I work with Dwight. - I'm Andy. He doesn't understand a word you're saying. Although born just minutes from here, he speaks only german. Closed society. So now after the readings by all of your sisters, we will arrive at the vows. So Conrad And away we go. This is a little taste of the ceremony, if you will. He's explaining why we're here, what we're doing here. Making introductions. Then he's gonna have Andy repeat a bunch of stuff. He's gonna ask Andy to produce a ring. I have now just just some twine for our purposes. You will put the ring on her finger. And then he's going to ask Andy, if he would like to marry Angela. And you will reply "I do." And he's gonna ask Angela if she would like to marry Andy, To which you will reply - I do. - And there we go. That's just about it. Man and wife. - Got a call about a problem up here. - Did somebody call Hank? Thank God you're here. The office is at a crossroads. So there's no security problem? You know I hustled up the stairs. I need your sage advice. And everyone, whatever Hank decides, that is the decision. That will resolve this issue. Yeah, take as many as you want. You know, it's nice and warm up here. So what are we talking about? Well, we have a surplus. Imagine that your parents give you money for a lemonade stand I know what a surplus is. Okay, good. Well, here's the thing. Some people want to use the surplus to buy a new copier. Other people are complaining about the chairs. - Is that the copier? - It is, yes. - What? - Just thinking. Let me see a chair. - You can try mine. - There we go. Not much lumbar support. Everyone, bear in mind once again that whatever Hank says goes. He is an impartial third party. On the one hand, this copier is very old. You should see some of the new copiers. You would not believe what they do. So the copier. Let me finish. Now the chairs. The chairs are very weak. Very weak chairs. I could not sit all day in this chair. Well, what should I do? - Let me see the copier again. - All right, get out. I thought I knew what I wanted. And then being here with you and the german mennonite minister, it just all felt right. I made a mistake picking Andy. I know you did. And that's why I have taken care of everything. - What do you mean? - Well, monkey He's a real minister. And you said, "I do." And I said, "I do." And Andy wasn't signing a receipt. He was signing our marriage certificate as a witness. That doesn't count! - Of course it does. - No, it doesn't! It does in the state of Pennsylvania. Mrs. Schrute. We are not married. Take this thing. It's not my fault you don't understand german. I've been telling you to take if for years! Are we We leaving or what? I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm eating tiramisu. Some of the chocolate powder just went down my throat. - I'm stopping now. - Is this why you're calling me? I'm calling I'm sorry. I'm calling because We have a stupid budget surplus and people Everybody wants something different. You want me to weigh in on a minor budget issue? I want you to make the decision so I'm not the bad guy. If I were you I'd just return the surplus and take the bonus. The what now? Branch managers who come in under budget get 15% of the savings. Like a tip? $645? I hate disappointing just one person. And I really hate disappointing everyone. But I love Burlington Coat Factory. You go in there with $645, you are literally a king. We got that going on Tuesday. Sure. No, I can I'll double check that for you. All right, attention everyone. Let me call you right back. I have made my decision. We do not need a new copier. We do not need new chairs. This copier is working perfectly. That's the original. Pam, would you stand up for a sec? See how relaxed I am? I like this chair. Offers good support. It is erkel-nomically correct. It's a good chair. I think we're spoiled because we don't appreciate the things that we have. You think kids in Africa have chairs? They sit in big piles of garbage. Do you think they have copiers? They don't have copiers. They don't even They don't even have paper. And we are spoiled because we throw out perfectly good tiramisu because it has a little tiny hair on it. My point is this. I have seen the light in terms of what we need and it is nothing. - Do you know? - Do I know what? I think you know. - Know what? - Yeah, know what? Does anyone happen to know what 15% of 4,300 is? $645. Michael's a genius. - Why did you say dollars? - Because that is how my mind works. What's 15% of 200? Everyone, Michael is returning the surplus so he can keep 15% as a bonus. - Wait, what? - You can do that? Michael, what's 394 times 5,912? Let's see. You're gonna give yourself a bonus of $645 instead of getting the office something it really needs. I don't need $645. I already have $645, more or less. - You're gonna get us a copier then? - Or chairs. This is so, so stupid. And, God That's my phone. - I didn't hear a phone ringing. - To be continued. No, I don't This doesn't change anything. I have a very important decision to make. We need a new copier. We need new chairs. And I need to figure out a way to keep this money without having everybody hate me. Hey, Tuna, check it out. Tuna sandwich. Just like you. Now I have to take care of a legal issue. Was that hot or what? So what's it gonna be? You have to make a decision. The day is almost done. You've been promising me this chair since the day you hired me. You are a smart guy. You'll do the right thing. - You think it's easy? - It's your job. You know what? Why don't you guys deal with it? I am going to get up and I'm gonna be out in the common area. But you need to decide. Otherwise, I'm taking the bonus. All right? It is a classic management tactic. You have two sides, a deadline. You know that neither of them are gonna concede. What you do is you put them in the room and you just - We're going with the chairs. - What? I figured I'd rather have new chairs than nothing at all. Good work. I'm proud of you. Mother What did we learn this week? Well, one, thanks to me, my team is much, much faster at coming to decisions than I thought they would be. Number two, never buy a fur coat with a credit card until you absolutely have the money to pay for it. And three, you should know that some people think it's cool to throw buckets of fake blood on you as you are walking out of Burlington Coat Factory. Truce. Yeah, I guess. Since I won. You did win. You did win. Anyway, I'm gonna need three copies of each of these stapled and collated. Totally kidding. I'm gonna need four. Good morning. Can i help you? Yes,i'm from techstar about a new phone system for you. I was wondering if i could talk to michael scott. I'm sorry. He's not in right now. Really? He's never around when i come by. Shoot.

No flowers for us. Relationships? We don't need no stinkin' relationships. I think we should all go around and tell our worst relationship story and then get past it. Just blow through it. Yeah? Kelly,what about ryan? He treated you pretty terribly,yeah? Well,his heart was in the right place. Yeah,but now his heart is in thailand-- Along with the rest of his body,having random sex.

Yes,he bowled five frames with this pink,sparkly thing until a little girhad to ask for her ball back. But that girl must have had monstrous hands because the holes fit. No,you just have little dainty fingers. You could always model ladies' jewelry. Nobody asked,bob. Do you risk telling them how you feel? Do you say something that you can barely admit to yourself? - Oh,god,what did you do?- So-- Wait,not that i approve of any of it,but-- I was stupid.I told him. Was he into you in,like,a gay way? Moron. If he was,there wouldn't be a story. He told me he wasn't gay. Really sad. I'm not done yet. Oh,my god. A week later,a friend of mine calls me up and he says," I just saw him in a gay bar in kansas city. "  Oh,no. Well,then it's a happy ending,because he was gay. You should call him. My worst breakup was actually two breakups. Two different men. I was in love with both of them,and when things went bad,they had a duel over me. Yeah,dwight and andy.We were here. No,this was years ago when i was living in ohio. John mark anjohn david. Angela,you had two sets of different men actually duel over you? I guess i have. All right. Who's next?Where's andy? He's on one of his honeymoons. What? He made non-Refundable deposits on his honeymoons, So he's just knockin' 'em off one at a time. I think today he's hot air ballooning,and later he's got a couples' massage. My worst breakup was with stacy. It was a sunday morning. We were reading the par. And i said,"oh,my god. I think the eagles could clench the n.F.C. East. " And she said that we're done. You know what,ys? I don't think we need to do this. You're right.Okay,everyone,back to work. No,no,no,no.I mean,have this kind of party. I look around and i see all these beautiful people who are alone on valentine's, And i think that there are other single people out there,too. We just ne tfind 'em. There's a girl out there for all of us. Maybe even in this office park. There has to be a way to get all these lonely people together. A net?A giant net? No,not a giant net. - A-- A-- A--  What do you have in mind? I was thinking maybe like a mixer. - Oh,god.That's a terrible idea.- Old-Fashioned meat market. - No. - I don't think it is. Lonely people mixing with one another? Breeding? Creating an even lonelier generation? You're not allowing natural selection to do its work. Kind of like the guy who invented the seat belt. These people need love. And i am going to get it for them. Who cares if we sell a little bit less paper today? A great boss cares more about thhaceppiness of his employees than anything else. ******** I am going to be cupid,and i am going to shoot my sparrow at unsuspecting victims, And they are going to get hit,and say,"i'm in love! I was hit by cupid's sparrow. " Funny little bird,but he gets the job done.. No movement. Ah,still early. Eh,it's not that early. So how you holding up? I'm okay.Feel a little lopsided 'cause of all the blood they took out of my right side. No,no,i meant about being single today. Exactly. Oh,here we go. - Hello. - Hello. Dwight k.Schrute. Why don't you introduce me to your little friend? - Dwight - Babe alert! Hello,i'm michael scott.Welcome to our little shindig. Oh,hi,i'm lynn. - Lynn,follow me.Come on in. - Off we go.

Well,he only gets better. - Thank you,michael. - Okay. I can untie any knot. I'm serious. Name a knot,any knot.Go ahead. Uh,i-- I believe you. You shouldn't believe everything you hear. In fact,there are many knots that i cannot untie. So where does a woman as charming as yourself find herself employed on a day such as today? Um,i work at a place that does catalogs for community colleges and small businesses. You must use a lot of paper. Oh,god.Tons of it. What's the rule about when people are in the bathroom? I think if you ordered hot food,you're allowed to eat. Damn. They've been in there for like ten minutes. Look at that. Bob ordered hot food. Yes. And i think they gave him too many fries. We should help him out. All right,the circle drive-In,they show old movies. It's really cool. That does sound cool. I used to go there with my fiancee. Before she left me. No,i-- I mean,before i left her. She left me. Stupid! I think i blew it. It all happened so fast. So fast. So erik,you mentioned before that you are in tool and dye repair. I am. Meredith recently had a total hysterectomy. So that's sort of a repair. L right.I'll let you guys talk. It's going very well.People are mixing. A lot of hope. 'Cause that's what you hate to see-- When hope gets crushed. Sorry. Thought i heard somebody coming in. Um,so it's not too late. And the kind of discoun we're talking about are not-- Hold on,hold on. Michael,why do you keep looking at the front door? - No reason. - Is somebody after you? Why do you always go to that? Has anyone ever been after anyone in this office? Hey,it just takes one. Nobody's after me. I just-- I met a woman when i was giving blood and i thought she might come by. You met a woman when you were giving blood?That is so romantic. It's not a big deal,really. I just-- You know,met mebody.We hardly talked. I picked up her glove,so i was hoping i could give it back to her. Oh,my god,that makes it even more romantic. This is like a modern-Dayenchanted. It's like a fairy tale. She could be your soul mate. Oh,not likely. Three billion women on the planet,most of them live in asia,so the numbers just don't add up. - It's possible. - She could be. Believe me,it's nothing. I hardly even talked to her. We just-- We were lying there next to each other. I think our blood bags touched. Here they come. - What? -No,just kidding. Seriously,though,that's enough. Well,just cover it with the broccoli. - Oh,great,i have to cover it with-- Do you think they dined and dashed? Well,they didn't dine. So yeah,maybe they just dashed. I thought we we having a nice time. We were. Yeah. - Empty. - Mine,too. Oh,boy. - Okay. - Oh,my go Is this the party? Nah. Okay,then. So where were we? Ah,bowling. Yep,yep.Yep. You didn't eat much there,jimbo. Oh,initially i did. Want some meat? - Oh,sure. - Little piece. No mushroom,though. - Forgot. - Yeah. Thank you. I'm sorry we did not have a chance to talk more. Yeah. I get very nervous talking to pretty girls. Seriously. Feel how sweaty my hand is. That's really sweaty. Are you on email? Oh,yeah. Cool. - Okay,bye. - Bye,kevin. Good valentine's. So basically the greater volume you decide to buy in,the greater discount we can give you. - Okay. - Okay? - What's up?-Look,i'm-- I'm gonna go. Before you go,i'd st love to get a firm commitment on this. Um  you know,maybe sign? Look,we already have a paper supplier. Okay. Well,thanks for wasting my time tonight. Idiot. God! You don't deserve her. Thanks,michael. Hey,if anybody wants to go-- - We can stay a little longer. - Really? Yeah. Yeah.Sure,michael. No,this is great. We'll hanout.Absolutely. Yeah. Oh,thanks. Michael,it's time. You know what?You guys-- You guys can head out. I'm-- I'm gonna soldier on a little bit. Come on. We'll all go. Yeah.Yeah.Let's go.Yeah. Okay. Four months ago,i dated a woman named holly. And,um,this is actually the first time that i've even considered getting back into that arena again. You know what? Sometimes it's not about whether cinderella gets her slipper back, But it's about the fact that the prince even picked up the slipper at all. There's a lot of princesses out there. You know,they have all different sizes and shapes of feet. And hands. So i think i think my odds are pretty good. Pardon me.May i have a chocolate chip cookie? I gave blood earlier and i'm still feeling woozy. Of course. That's weird. You got a cotton ball and tape and we've been using band-Aids. I,uh-- Oh,i feel so woozy. I just-- It's band-Aids. Ah,damn. I had no idea when I got into that car to go to New York that I was going to be quitting. I got on the ramp, and I was like, "two hours, two hours to go. "Feelin' good. Crank some tunes. Should have peed before I left." Get to the good part. Get up to building. Revolving door broken. So I have to take the normal door. At least he's in the building. I was so nervous, it was the wrong building. I had walked into the wrong building. He finally has a story we really want to hear. And he knows it. OK, focus, focus. You're in the right building. You're with the right people. - What happened? - I looked at Wallace and I said, "I quit." And as I turned to leave, I looked back and I said, "You have no idea how high I can fly." You didn't tell him how sick of him you were? Why would I do that? Wouldn't it feel good to tell him that he's incompetent That he's wasted Maybe spit in his face. You have thought about this a lot more than I have. I just winged it. I love a good quitting story. It makes me feel like I have control over my own life. Gives me hope. Maybe I'll have one of my own someday. But I dream. Proofreading: So. &amp; Valpi Episode 5x19 "Two weeks" About a week ago, Michael gave his 2 weeks' notice. Surprisingly, there is a big difference between Michael trying and Michael not trying. Michael, is that scotch? Scotch and Splenda. Tastes like Splenda, gets you drunk like scotch. Clinky clinky clink. Come on. Come on, come on. What am I gonna do? I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. A little bit of this, a little bit of that. I'm gonna stay up all day. I'm gonna sleep up all night. I'm gonna give it a and I'm gonna stop worrying about calories. Maybe you should go into your office, close the door, and make some calls about jobs. - I have a job. - For four more days. Do you have any leads? You don't understand At my level, you don't look for a job. - You are headhunted. - Have you called headhunters? Any good headhunter knows that I am available. Any really good headhunter will storm your village with overwhelming force and cut off your head with a knife. Right, 'cause that's what we're talking about. I need you to go over these client lists and indicate any wrong or false data. Your "I need you to" is my command. Can I talk to you? You can talk to me for as long as you want because I have all the time in the world. I just wanted to tell you that What's that? What is this about? 'Cause you're leaving and everything. It's a farewell. So I hope I get to work with you some day again. Me, too. - Is this wine? - Busted, yes. I already have wine. Isaac Silby here for the interview. Have a seat. It'll be a few minutes. You interviewing, too? Interviewing? For? Regional manager. Yes, I am. For regional manager, I've decided to go with an outside hire. For obvious reasons. - Where you from? - Philly. That's a drive. Well, this is one of the few places that's hiring. It's It's brutal out there. - When will the new copier be ready? - I'm working on it, Kev. You said it would be ready by today. And it is today. - It'll be ready soon. - "Soon" could mean anything. "Soon" could be three weeks. Is that what "soon" means to you? Sometimes. Then come back soon. During the course of business, a copier goes through something called "normal wear and tear." - I think it's 75 cents. - That's a lot. Bandit, no. Yesterday they delivered the new one. But they didn't set it up. So my day just got a little more interesting. It's monster.com. Singular. You work in paper long enough, you get to know the players. Hi, you've reached Prince Paper. We are sad to inform you that after 40 years of serving the community, we are no longer in business. Thank you for your support and may God bless you. What am I gonna do? You want me to come into your office? All right. Close your eyes. - I'd prefer not to. - Just close your eyes. I'm going to start my own paper company. You're starting your own paper company. Why? 'Cause I know paper. I know everything there is to know. Do you know that the industry is in decline? God, I practically invented decline. I know paper. I know how to manage. - I have a name. Close your eyes. - I did that. It added nothing. Just close 'em. "Michael Scott Paper Company." You want in? Do you want to be a part of this? I am not gonna do this. - and you are not going to, either. - Obvious - Agreed. Except - Here's the thing. What I wish for you is that you land a job at a company that "a," exists, and "b," has a salary because they're set up to do that kind of thing. What's up, Chuck? - What are you doing? - Nothing. Just talking. Michael handed in his notice. Did you also I didn't. - After you. - No, I'm staying. You want me to translate the german instructions? I'm sure they're pretty much the same as the english instructions. Typical american arrogance that got us involved in a war we never should have been in. World War II. Fine. Do the german instructions say what this is supposed to do? Deutsch. Let me see here. It is either an incense dispenser or a ceremonial sarcophagus. My german is pre-industrial and mostly religious. Listen, this order form Instead of "Dunder Mifflin", is there any way I could get it to say something else? Like "Michael Scott Paper Company"? Somebody's been talking in bed. Pillow talk. Listen, Michael. Have you really thought this through? 'Cause it's a big risk. This is a dream that I have had since lunch, and I am not giving up on it now. You could give it up though, right? And almost no one would know. Before you got here, I'm the one who landed all of these clients. Half of 'em, at least. I can do it again. I know the market. I know the price points. I'm on it. Don't worry. So how do I do that? You can scan it. And then you can upload the image, - then you can copy - Could I take a piece of paper and just tape it with transparent tape? Good. Thank you very much. So that is why I have to leave at 5:00 on Tuesdays. It's to pick up my little sisters from school. We're really tight. We're like the Kardashians. - You can run this stuff by Toby. - I don't like talking Come in. I didn't realize you were with anyone. But I wanted to bring you the brochure on that accounting seminar that I was telling you about earlier. We're in the middle of something It was so much fun last year. There was a sundae bar. I didn't have any You know, to stay trim. Did Michael just let anybody in his office? I loved invite us in all the time. He was like, "come in." I am aware of the effect I have on women. So you should be heading back to your desk. You'll let me know. She's such a special person. She's turning 50 this year. I'm starting my own paper company. No way! - In this climate? - In all climates. It's going to be worldwide. And I'm looking for some talented salesmen to join me. That's where you come in. It's a very intriguing concept, isn't it? Michael is starting his own paper company. What do you think about that? - Your own paper company. - Can you believe it? We'll see. It's a nugget of an idea right now, so. - Right. - Potential. Lots of potential. What a courageous venture. It's very courageous. Very exciting. Location is hard for me, with the farm and the responsibilities so With the farm. You getting to wherever I'm gonna put my thing. Think about it. Let's put a pin in it for now. I would love to put a pin in that. Everyone, can I have your attention? This is the moment you've all been waiting for. Right? Little Miss thing wants attention. It's a G-44. It's not ready, Kevin. I am at a crucial point where I have sunk four hours into that copier. And I am not gonna let it beat me like that wireless router did. - A note in my food? - I made it sterile. Just to say "sterile" doesn't make it so. I am offering you the opportunity of a lifetime, to come work for me. Do you have a business plan? A funding request? Market research? Financials? You need those things. Most new businesses, they don't make a profit till at least two years. And then your margins will be razor-thin. Best-case scenario, you don't cut a salary for at least 5 years. Can you go five years without a salary? - Five years? - You already have the job. - You don't have to convince me. - It's just not prudent. Can't you see I'm urinating? Listen. You don't need to answer me now. Just I want you to think about it. I am starting my own company. You're not letting me finish, and you just lost out on $1 million. No, I didn't. You know what? I had a great time at prom. And no one said "yes" to that, either. How's it working? Let's see. It's fine. I did it. I learned everything about this machine. I know all the buttons, even the inside ones. I know all the error messages. I could do a bound book in plastic with offset colors. Which feels You ready? I can't pretend I haven't seen that. I'm gonna ask you to stand up, walk out, and you can't take anything. I have immunity. It's my two weeks Not if you're starting a competing paper company. You really think Hank is going to be loyal to you? Please escort Charles from the building. Come on, man, let's go. I always thought Michael got a bad rap. He's a good guy, and he's super funny. Maybe I should tell him before he goes. He's all the way over there. Well, here we are. I would just like to You're done, Michael. All right, then, everybody. I'm out of here. - What is he doing? - It looks like he's saying something. I think he's singing. I can't believe this is really happening.  and I feel free. And just like that, as mysteriously as he arrived, he was gone. The whole office feels darker. You know? It's just a sad, dark day. - He's gone. - I know. You don't have to kiss his ass anymore. Michael's like a movie on a plane. It's not great, but it's something to watch. And then when it's over, you're like, "How much time is left on this flight? "Now what?" Don't look down. Look straight up. Come on. Please. For employees only. Angela, Kevin, help me out. I need a few things. Then I'll be gone. Why is it that you asked everyone except me, Angela, Creed and Meredith? I was going to. I wanted to, but I had to start somewhere. And you didn't want to start with us? Of course not. But now I want everybody. Buddy. Buddy. Jimbo. Did you have time to think about my offer? I did, but then I thought about something else. So which way are you leaning? It is tempting, but I am 100% leaning towards passing. Did anyone see the client list that Michael was supposed to be working on? Let me know if you find it. We don't have much time. Just act normal. Don't look at me. Stop. Don't look down. He's gonna see me. Not all the way up. Keep 'em at a normal height, OK? This is not Michael talking right now. This is your future. I am your future. You are older and you are very happy now because you went with Michael Scott, right? So everybody, come on down, and let's just crawl out of here together. All right? Come on. Are you doing your best here? Are you being the best that you can be? Everybody who's gonna go with me, I want you to stomp your foot. All right. Come on. You're coming with me. Come on, Phyllis. Here we go. Here we go. Get up. All right. Time to go. Time to go. Jim, let's go. Come on! - What are you doing? - I think maybe Hank should be here. No, I don't need Hank. You're gonna mess with me? I'll tell you something, Charles. I don't even care because I've got nothing to lose. All right. It's not worth it. What? I'm going with him. What? I'm going. You can't be serious. Michael, wait! I'm coming with you. You are? It's gonna be great. Great. Except I don't want to be a receptionist anymore. Right. - Executive assistant. - Salesman. All right. - Deal. - Deal. - Well, Jim? - Still no. Well, let's go. All my stuff is still upstairs. - Are people watching? - Probably. It's not how you leave an office. We're having a company meeting here. - I will bring all your stuff home. - OK, I'll see you later. See you later. So we had a personnel change today. Shouldn't affect our day-to-day, but until we get a new receptionist, I want Kevin on the phones. Phones. Also, there's been way too much wasting time. So Stanley I want you on top of that. I want you to be my productivity czar. Good. That's it on my list so, no excuses, guys. Let's get going, OK?   - Attention, everyone! Jim and I, on behalf of - Too loud. - The party planning committee, - Too too loud, too loud. - Have an annou-- But effective. Look. On behalf of jim and I, Merry christmas. Merry christmas. - Good. - My diabolical plot is on hold for christmas. My heart just melts with the sound of children singing. Not really. I'm just tired. The days are short. I don't know. Maybe I'm depressed. It is time to unveil the tree. - Hey, rockefeller center. - Yeah. - Uh, I've actually been to rock center, And this is nothing like that. - This is all we have. - Ugh. - Nope, it's not "ugh." It is office camaraderie. - It is warm feelings. - Why don't we talk more about it instead of doing it? - 30, 29, 28 - Why would you start so high? - 27 - 3, 2, 1 - 26 - Ooh. - Ah. - You didn't decorate it. - No, exactly. - We didn't, because we think It would be better to do it together. - Everyone. - Why would you wrap it in a sheet If you're not covering anything up? - Is--is it fake? - Pam. - Yes! We are unveiling an artificial tree. That will never die - Yes. - Like the spirit of christmas. - And we're supposed to applaud you For you taking a giant diaper off a fake tree? - This was a successful unveiling. Go back to work! Merry christmas. - Hello. Sorry, guys. Sorry, guys. I'm not sure I've earned the right To make announcements yet, But whoever is giving me the twelve days of christmas As my secret santa, Please stop. I can't take it anymore. My cat killed a turtledove. The french hens have started pulling out my hair To make a nest. Please stop. - What psycho would send that as a gift? - I begged dwight and jim To give me erin for secret santa. And I decided to give erin the twelve days of christmas. Bowtie time. Is it my fault that the first eight days There's basically - Ho, ho, ho! Merry christmas, boys and girls. It's me, santa claus. - Hey, santa. - They finally let you do it. - Congrats, phyl. - It's so edgy. - I have been wanting to be santa for years. I believe I have the right temperament And the figure to do the job well. I slipped a note to jim And he said I could do it. ohIt's been a long journey But I'm santa claus! - So, santa, what can we expect from this party? - It's going to be a very jolly time If you've been good. - What if you've been bad? - Oh, then nothing but a lump of coal for you. - What if you've been really, really bad? More "evil" than strictly "wrong." - Hey, creed, we covered it. Lump of coal. - For the past several weeks, My secret santa has been giving me pieces of a machine That I've been attempting to assemble. I'm suspicious of this, Because I had the exact same idea For catching osama bin laden. I would simply send him a different piece each day. He would assemble it To find himself In jail! - You know, oscar, every time I make this lasagna, People ask me if it's a family recipe. But reallyI just get the recipe from the box. - That's funny. - Is it funny? I thought it was more Interesting than funny. I think my water just broke. - That's too funny. - Oscar and the warehouse guy. Go, oscar! Go, gay warehouse guy! - Here'sSanta! Hey, little girl, what would you like for christmas? Ooh! You have been a very naughty girl, I see. - Michael, we already have a santa--phyllis. - What the hell is going on? Phyllis, jim? Phyllis is santa. - Yeah. - Phyllis. - Yeah. I told her a long time ago she could do it. - Take it back. That is absurd. - No. I'm not gonna do that. - No--no! Jim, come on! - I think she'll do a good job. - It's insane! A woman santa? Where does it stop? No! Jim, this may be the last christmas that we have here. Doesn't it make you a tiny bit anxious Me not playing santa? Come on! - I'm not gonna go tell phyllis that she can't be santa. - Fine. Then do it anonymously. Ransom note style. You can You know what? I have a bunch of letters cut out of magazines in my desk. You can use those. If this were russia, yeah. Sure, everybody would go to one santa. And there would be a line around the block, And once you sat on her lap And she asked you what you wanted, You would say, probably, "freedom" At which point the kgb would arrest you And send you to siberia. It's a good thing russia doesn't exist anymore. Ho, ho, ho! Ho, ho, ho! Why pay more to sit next to old tranny claus over there When you can sit on my lap? Phyllis is only pretending to be a man. I'm the real thing! Sit down on my lap, and there will be no doubt! No, it's not, like, penis-wise. Hello, little boy! What's your name? - Michael, it's me, kevin. Phyllis says I'm too big for her lap. - Oh, I am so sorry that phyllis hates you And hates your body. But santa remembers a reindeer That was just a tiny bit different as well. - When can I sit on your lap? - Right now! Come on over here, big boy! There we go! oh, my god. - It's really comfortable. what would you like for christmas, little boy? - I don't know. I-I didn't know you were gonna ask me that. - Well, what did you think was going to happen? - I didn't know.

So they said we are sold. - David is gone, alan is gone. We're all gone. - Okay, but we haven't gone under.

I'll call david. - No, you won't, because he's not picking up his phone. - Yes, I will, because I always know how to get through to him. He told me where his kids go to school. I call the school.

Over here is meredith palmer, creed bratton. Another couple of heartbreakers. Who's this tall drink of sun tea? That is jim halpert. He is the co-regional manager of this office.

Jeez, you gave me a paper cut on my throat! Yeah, I have this thing about men cutting Or threatening to cut my throat. Don't try to cut my throat. Jo, I don't know how things work in florida-- Which, from your description, sounds like A colorful, lawless swamp. But here It takes two men to do one job, Where in florida it might take one very strong woman To do such a job. - WhoaWhoa! - Whoa, whoa! - I'll take over. Um, what we're doing here-- Michael handles more of the big picture stuff, And I handle more of the day-to-day stuff. - Yeah - So together - I think I understand. - All right. Each of you is doing half a job. - No. - And sometimes I can Hardly handle that. Now, this is knucklehead talk. I'm not gonna abide it, you know. You can't give me gravy and tell me it's jelly, 'cause gravy ain't sweet Is it, jim? [whispers] I don't think so. - Michael? - Forget the question. I think one of you should return to sales And the other one will be manager. I humbly accept the management position. Why would you just automatically get it? BecauseWell, jim, Where I'm from, there're two types of folk-- Those who ain't, And those who are kne e-high on a grasshopper. Which type ain't you ain't? Y'all come back now. Do you even know what that means? Yes. Well, I'm gonna let this marinate, so you can go. - Um - You can go on. Yep. Shoo. I'm joleen bennett. Jo for short. I'm a breast cancer survivor. Close, personal friends with nancy pelosi, And truman capote and I slept with three of the same guys. When I was a little girl, I was terrified to fly, And now I have my own pilot's license. I am ceo of sabre international, And I sell the best damn printers And all-in-one machines korea can make. Pleased to meet you. Whoa, traffic jam. - Uh-oh! Traffic jam on route 3. - Beep beep! - Beep beep! There's blood everywhere! [both giggling] Um, I got you a valentine's card. - You did? - Yep. Oh, a bird and a dog. Yeah, well, it's snoopy and woodstock. - You named them? - Uh, charles schulz did. I thought it was relevant 'cause I got you all those birds for christmas. Remember? - Uh, yeah, I do remember. Aw, they love each other. Oh, look at that. They sure do. I hadn't noticed. Oh, it smells really good too. Yeah. It's roger federer for men. I sprayed some in there. Andy, whoa! Thank you very much. It's got pheromones in it. - Hey. - Hi. UhJust choosin' seats. Not getting married. Chop-chop, little onion. Jo, there's books in my chair. That's right, darling. Now you're the proud new owner of a sabre handbook And my autobiography. Now, you all must be in a tizzy. I can see it on your faces. I mean, what's going on now? I mean, who owns dunder mifflin, right? I mean, sabre? What's that? Some company we never heard of From down in tallahassee? Where is that? Near mars? No, we know. Texas. Now, dunder mifflin has an arm's reach Into all these small businesses all over the northeast. And now we're gonna take that arm And we're gonna start selling Printers. I could manage my way around that. They're the easiest to use printers in the market. I will try to manage my excitement. I have been saying the word "manager" a lot So whenever jo thinks manager, she thinks of me. Camel cigarettes did the same thing with joe camel By making him look like a penis. I can't even go near a cigarette now Without thinking of a penis. And vice versa. I think that's it. So we're all good. Thanks, y'all. - I, um Oh, my god. I guess andy likes me. I never thought of him in that way. But I guess in most romantic comedies, The guy you're supposed to be with Is the one that you never thought of in that way. You might have even thought he was annoying Or possibly homosexual. So check this out. According to the handbook, You could make more money as a salesman Than as a manager. They have all these incentive programs. I ran your numbers from last year. i&gt;- This is way more than I make now. I don't think I'm gonna miss being manager. You know, some people say they're not in it for the money. Well, with all due respect to this job, I think I'm definitely in it for the money. And, quite honestly, the women. [click] hey. Got a second? - Sure. - All right. What, are you here to tell me That you think I would be a better manager And that you are sorry for being such a jerk? ActuallyYeah. What? Exactly that. I think that you Absolutely deserve the manager position more than I do. [laughs] what? Really? - Yeah. [laughing] wow! Wow! * la la la la, hello, oscar * Michael. Reading. - What are you reading? - The atlantic. Oh, that is my favorite ocean--I love it! I'm so happy right now. No! I can't keep it a secret any longer. Jim's stepping down to salesman. I am going to be the sole manager once again. I should step into sales myself. Why? Is there an untapped gay market? Sabre has no caps on commissions. He can make a lot more money in sales. Where did you get that information? Manual. Manuel who? Mm-hmm. Well, according to the manual, There is no cap on commissions. I have been hustled. [quietly] son of a bitch. Pardon me. - Oh. Speak of the devil. We were just talking about you. Have a seat. - Okay. - Now, jim here is, uh Thinking about taking himself out of the running For being manager. - Yep. - Really? Oh, that is so sweet of you! But I cannot accept, because I have been thinking about it, And I think I want to go back to sales. - Really? - Mm-hmm. - Really? - Yeah. You can take the man out of the salesman, But you can't take the sales out of salesman. Well, I think you're both being a little too modest. No, I really, really think michael Is better at being manager for so many reasons. - Mm -mm. No. I think I would be bad. IWould sleep in my office, And I would sexually harass people. Why would you do that? I'm turning myself in right now. You know, michael, You have more experience in sales and management, So I'm gonna defer to your judgment. Thank you. I think you will become the salesman, And congratulations You're gonna be the new manager of this branch! Great! That's great. Congratulations. [quietly] have fun signing my commission checks, boss. Oh! Michael marked his heights. He'sGrown. Mm. [both chuckle] Bobcat, this is dragon. Listen, he's been promoted to sole manager. We have got to step this up. Meet me behind the dumpster in 90 seconds. You're 20 minutes late. Um I was at another dumpster. Just admit you lost track of time. Ryan and I have been meeting up To work on our diabolical plot against jim. Ryan is always late for our meetings. I wish I had a lair. i&gt;- Did you see saw? Course I seesaw. Mose and I seesaw all the time. No. Uh, the movie. Did you see the movie saw? Oh. Yeah. Great film. Almost as fun as going on a seesaw. Okay, the reason these movies are so popular Is the element of psychological torment. I like where you're going with this. Continue. Can we lure him into an old warehouse or something? I have an old barn. It's kinda smelly - Yes! But that might be a plus. Okay, then what? i&gt;- We do what they did in saw. I mean, we don't kill him, obviously. - I don't-- - I have a mask Okay. That's your idea? Exactly like in the movie? That is the most idiotic thing I have ever heard in my life! Well, suggest something else then, don't just-- He's supposed to cut his leg off? - Don't just criticize my idea! - Think! You think of something then! Michael, I'm worried that, uh, Not all your toys are gonna fit on your new desk. How is that possible? Well, in your old office, There were all those ledges and extra space-- No excuses, erin. Come on! Make it happen. You know, I actually think that I should get back to work. Jim asked me to do some stuff, and he's manager. Oh. Yeah. Fine, fine. - Okay. - Leave it here. All right. I have to make some sales anyway. Who should I call with my magic sales fingers? [telephone rings] [ringing] Michael scott, head of sales. You gotta do something, man. You can't just sit there. The new I.T. Guy. Nick. - Nick. - I think he's the key. He's very trusting. He's looking for friends. He's been given an awesome amount of power And does not know how to wield it. Like frodo. Why don't you just let me handle the tolkien references, Okay, dumb jock? Well, I think he can be corrupted. Like gollum. Smeagol was corrupted And became gollum. I might start a diabolical plot against him After this one. Who's hungry? - What is that? - That's ants on a log. Michael would always have me bring them in at 2:30 And say, "who's hungry?" - [laughs] oh. I'm fine. Thank you, though. Do you want me to spin you in your chair and make you dizzy? - Why would I want to do that? - It's a thinking technique. All the top executives do it. It keeps the brain moving, And aSpinning brain is a working brain. For now, I'm just gonna go back to work here. - Oh, sure. - Yeah. Thank you. Well It will be a pleasure doing business with you. Thanks. Bye-bye. [train whistle sound] I just got a new account. The gentleman's club in carbondale. It is called curves. I went by there the other day. Saw some of the women walking in. NotReally my cup of tea. Actually, kevin, you might like it. Nice. You know, we really don't announce out loud Our sales that much. Why not? It's part of the sales experience. It's not really 1992 anymore. Well, okay. [laughter] "you brighten my day with the sound of your voice. "you bring so much laughter and love. "you're everything to me, And I was so blessed when god sent you here to me." - Jeez louise. - I know. Obsessed with me much? - Well, everyone got one. - What did yours say? "friends are worth sharing a doghouse with." It's no wonder That andy gave kelly such a romantic card. I can't compete with her. That girl can sing and dance And gets all of her clothes at the mall And I feel like such a fool For thinking that andy was only going after one girl. 'cause andy bernard is a playboy, And why shouldn't he be? He's got it all. Ho ho. There he is, the I.T. Guy. See you discovered the break room. - Uh, yep. - I imagine One of the best things about being an I.T. Guy Is you get to know everyone's computer passwords. You know, I actually don't. [all laugh] Listen. I know you have to say that, But we got a little problem here. There is a employee named jim halpert, And he's doi some terrible things, okay? He's molesting people via the internet, And we need to stop him. I think that you should call the cops-- No. The cops called us. So I'm gonna need you to give me the password To jim halpert's computer. I don't know what to tell you, man, I'm sorry. I just can't give out his password like that. Nick, we could make things very Very difficult for you. Are you You threatening me? Threatening you? No. What is that smell? Do you smell that? What is that? Like a sulfur deposit under here? MichaelStop. No, I'm serious. We don't have to put up-- Is it the dogs? - [whispers] michael. You know what? We don't have to deal with this. I'm going to google sulfur maps. Michael, it's phyllis. No, this is geological. I sent an email out to everyone in this area That this might be a side effect To my new allergy medication I'm on. - Are you kidding me? - No. And you guys are okay with this? She sent an email It's not 'cause of the smell. I'm just expecting a nosebleed. Oh, my god. Oh[giggling] you scared me. I'm sorry. I thought you saw me. I didn't see you. And you were there all along. Well, I warmed it up for you. So should be good to go. Cool. Thanks. Bye, andy. - That was weird. - No, it ain't. We all saw the valentine you gave her. I don't even know what that card said. Believe me, if I got that card, We'd be in the bathroom doing it rightNow. Oh! Hey. Hey. You know, it's funny, I used to stand in here And wish I was out there. Now I'm out there, and I wish I was in here. Well, the grass is always greener. Yeah. Except there's no grass out there. It's just a farty dirt patch. Well, it's what you wanted. I really need my job back. We made a terrible mistake here. For the record, I fought this, all right? And nowI'm not really sure what we do. We make a poster that says "happy opposite day," And she sees it on the way out-- That's stupid. Oh, I wish we had one of those Amnesia flashlights from men in black and just-- Hey, what was that movie Where their boss was within earshot, And they could have just gone and talked to her? - Lethal weapon? - That's it. I think we should do it the lethal weapon way. You two are grown-ass men. What do I have to do, Fire you and get two people in here Who don't need so much management? Wha? What I'm saying-- Michael's saying that he's better at being a manager, And I agree, because he's a better people person, Weird--weirdly. - And weirdly, I'm a good dog person, right, guys? See? They love me. Fine. I don't care which one of you does which job. JustStop meetin' with me to talk about it. All right. All right. [cell phone rings] - oh. I gotta take this. Yep.

I don't talk like that. - [Laughs] Say, "me eat cookie." - No. I won't say it. - Why is everyone clumped around accounting? Break it up, you clique. - It's Kevin as cookie monster from Sesame Street. - Is that the program where all those puppets live in the barrio? - Mm-hmm. - I love that show. - This is Kevin. This is Kevin. - Thank you. - That is an amusing link. I'd like it sent to me, please. - Yes. - Me too, Oscar. Please send it to me. [All agreeing] - C.C. Me. - Angela, this is inappropriate. - This is my favorite day. [Cheerful music]   - it's secretary's day. And it is Erin's and my three-week anniversary. So perfect storm for a romantic gesture. Want to make sure the whole office remembers it's secretary's day. I sent an email blast, a text blast, a good, old-fashioned talk blast. I sent a snail mail blast a week ago. And a stern reminder via fax at 7:00 this morning, so people better step up and appreciate the crap out of Erin. - Here you go. - Oh, thank you. - I do. - Thank you. [clatter] - If it wasn't for secretaries, I wouldn't have a stepmom. - Welcome back. - Hey, thanks. It's my first day back after maternity leave. And I miss cece, of course. But we need the money. What was maternity leave like? Oh, how do I explain it? It rocked. It rocked my ass off. Oh. You couldn't have watered it? - I literally did not know that existed until this moment. - Well, I knew it existed, and I chose to let it die. - It's nice to see you again, Dwight. - Hello, Pam. - I was just wondering what you had planned for secretary's day. - I'm going to give Erin $15. - I know that Erin would be so psyched if you took her out to lunch. - A one-on-one lunch with Erin? - Yeah. She really looks up to you. And there's only so much we can do as her coworkers. Secretary's day is really kind of a boss-secretary thing. - She's kind of a rube. - That's my girlfriend you're talking about. - Okay. All right. All right. Okay. I'll take her to lunch. [Tapping desk] - She's gonna be so psyched. - Hi, Erin. Happy secretary's day. - Well, happy boss's day. There wouldn't be a secretary if there was no boss. - I wanted to know what your plans for lunch were because I was hoping to ask you to Lunch. - I got a picture of you asking me to lunch. I was thinking we could go to Hayworth's. - Ugh. - Just the two of us. - Well, Hayworth's is more business casual, and they always screw up your order. So I'm - Yeah, okay. Yeah, that was a stupid suggestion. I was thinking someplace special, so I thought Hayworth's, but - Okay, well, we'll figure something. - Oh. - Okay, let's go to Hayworth's. - Okay. - All right. - Have a cookie, kev. - Yeah, ha ha. Tray of cookie. I'm not falling for that. - I brought those in. It's my birthday. That's some stone-cold narcissism right there. - Man, Darryl, I'm sorry. Happy Birthday. - Thank you. - [As cookie monster] Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum. [Laughter] - They're making fun of cookie monster. I get that. But in a strange way, it feels like they're making fun of me. Oscar, did you eat some of my m&amp;m;'s? The level-- - this is violent and offensive. - Thank you. It really make me self-conscious about my voice. - It's awful. - I'm not crying. - You have some food on your face. - Do my hands feel sweaty to you? - The beginning here has been a little bit of a fiasco. Either they don't respect me or they respect me too much. And some of them still think that I'm the I.T. Guy. This cookie monster thing is an opportunity to show people that I'm an authority figure. Hello, everyone. If I might have a moment of your time. It's come to my attention that people have been watching and laughing at a hurtful parody video. It is now forbidden to talk, joke about, or email this around. - Yeah. - And that's straight from corporate. So, not to be scary, but, yeah, I would listen to me. And that's all. Ciao. - Would you mind if I listen to my book on tape? I'm kind of a bookworm. This is a novelization of the movie precious: Based on the book push by sapphire. - I was thinking it would be fun to talk on the way over. So what decade would you have chosen to be a teenager? - I don't know. - I would have chosen the 1490s. 'Cause America was discovered. - Right. [Sighs] - And then my last job was at a taco bell express. But then it became a full taco bell, and I don't know, I couldn't keep up. My favorite part about being a receptionist is that I get to have my own desk. In my foster home, I never had a desk. So it's like--I don't mean that I didn't like my foster home. I did like it. I just didn't have a desk there. Did you have a favorite age? Or month? - An age or month? - Yeah, like a favorite month. Like, I like April when I was seven. - I've been trying. I've been trying to keep it going. Erin is just weird. - How many pillows do you sleep on at night? - So how are things going with Andy? - He's the best boyfriend in the world. Tell me about him before I met him. - Well, let's see. Um Andy. Plays the banjo. - Yeah. I love that. - Other than the fact that he dated Angela, I don't think he is a snappy dresser. - What? - I don't think he is the best dresser. Reminds me of Easter. - Sorry. About Angela? Did you say he dated Angela? - Mm-hmm. You didn't know that? Oh. - Here we go. Hot plate. - Okay. - And your salad, miss. - Why wouldn't he tell me that? - I don't know. Probably didn't want you to have a mental image of him having sex with somebody else. - They had sex? - They were engaged, so Okay. You know what, sir? - Yes. - Yeah, I asked for pickles with my burger, and there are only, like, five or six. Could I get some more pickles? - Of course. I'll get you a bowl of pickles. - Thank you. - They were engaged? - Mm-hmm. Yeah. - Uh-oh. - Well - [Moans] - What are you doing? What are you doing? - In the foster home, my hair was my room. [Exhales] [Prolonged exclaiming] - Okay. You know what? You know what? You know what? Everybody's looking at you right now. - [Breathes heavily] [Groans] - I'll have what she's having. - Did you have a-- did you like your lunch? Did you have a good lunch? Did you like that? Did you enjoy your food? It was good. I liked my lunch. - Ooh. Ah-ah-ah. Ha-ha. - What's up? - Her milk is coming in. She's getting uncomfortable. - Dwight, don't be gross. - No, no, he's right. - Same thing happens with my cows if I don't tend them frequently enough. You gotta milk them, or else they'll moo like crazy. - That's weird. My breast pump is missing. Have you seen my breast pump? - All right, this is gonna traumatize me a hell of a lot more than you, believe me. - You know what, Dwight? Let me just check the bathroom first. Okay? - Really? Fine. Let your breasts explode. Three squeezes and I would drain you. - Mm. Meredith! - I just like the way it feels. - What are you doing? - Relax. Okay. - Relax? - This is like the Cadillac of pumps. - Give it back to me now. - Okay, I was just warming it up. - It's disgusting! - It's not a big deal. - It's not sterile! - We're both girls. Who cares? - So How was lunch? - Lunch was fine. - Was it everything that you hoped and dreamed it might be? - I don't know. It was lunch, Andy. - Well, I know. [stammers] Just want-- I mean [Chuckles] - Erin? I think we're out of fax cover sheets. - God, Oscar, will you keep your pants on? It's easy. [Drawer shuts] - [As cookie monster] "My name is Kevin. I'm an accountant." See, I did the voice. - That's a little derivative. - But parody is always derivative. - Uh, it's not organic. Do you know what I mean? - Jim does a really good one. Do yours. - Oh, guys. I really refuse to participate. "Michael, can I have an advance on my paycheck because a Mrs. field cookie just opened up at the mall." - Guys, why don't we leave the parodies to the pros at madtv? - "Sorry, Gabe, but that show hasn't been on in many cookies." - Okay. - Hey, can I have your attention, please? First of all, thanks to everyone for helping put this awesome party together. And a very special shout-out to the chair of the party planning committee, miss Angela Martin. You have outdone yourself. [Applause] - You know what, I think we can all agree that Angela's not so great, so - I am saying the exact opposite. Angela is fantastic. - No. No. No. - Specific shout-out - Stop talking. - Okay. As some of you may know, I have a very special connection to secretary's day in the form of that 115-pound moonbeam over there named Erin hannon. To a lot of you she may just be the person who brings you your fax confirmations, but to me, she is my girlfriend In addition to being the person who brings me my fax confirmations. So I wrote a [English accent] Little ditty that I would like to play for all of you right now. It's a little tune called secretary of love. A one, a two, a one, two, three-- [Gasping] - I know about Angela. I know that you were engaged to her and that you were sleeping with her. Michael told me. - Oh, God. - Erin, can we talk about this in private? - I don't want it to be in private. Is it true or is it not? - Yes. - Who else did you sleep with? Did you sleep with Phyllis or Kelly or Pam? Maybe all together? - No. No, never. - Did everyone know? Was I the only one who didn't know? - Yeah, pretty much. - Pretty much. - Who are you? I don't know you. I don't know you! - I should probably get involved in this, but I think my energy is better spent on the cookie monster issue. - Erin, you know, if I had been engaged to anybody before you, I would have told you. - Thanks. - So if you need anything, I'm right over there. - "Hey, Erin, you look delicious. I mean, beautiful." - [Snickers] - Okay. Okay. There. I heard that. So I'm sorry, Pam, but that's it. I'm going to have to suspend you without pay for two days. - What? What do you mean, suspend me? - I think you need to go a little easy. You can't just suspend someone from work. - Yeah, you're right. You know what? Um, you're suspended too, Jim. - [Laughs] Okay. - Fine. You too, Dwight. - Wait, what? I was just slow-clapping your no-nonsense decision-making. - I don't want to hear it. Suspended. - "C" is for suspension. - Why would that be something that you would talk about on secretary's day? - Andy, she's not the easiest person in the world to have a conversation with. All right? And besides, who doesn't tell their girlfriend that they were engaged to someone who works four feet away from them? That's like-- that's-- that's, like, mr. And Mrs. smith crap. - I was gonna tell her, just on my own time. - You know what, I resent the implication that I would keep that secret. Everyone here knows that I can't and won't keep a secret. - Who cares? I mean, it's not like I killed somebody. Big deal, right? This can blow over in two seconds. She never asked me, so, if you think about it I probably should have told her, I guess. Everybody does stupid things. - Psst. Hey. Erin. - You want to talk to me, come to my desk. - You embarrassed me earlier. - Oh, take it up with the chief of police. - You think I want people remembering I had sensual relations with Andy? It's the kind of thing you wish you could have annulled. I want to throw up just thinking about it. - I want to throw up just thinking about it. - You are throwing up for the wrong reasons. - I don't think this fax is going through. Is there a different I can just put it through again, you know. - Hey. You know, I was engaged before Jim. - Really? - Yeah. And he worked here too. - It was Andy, wasn't it? - No, no, it wasn't Andy. It wasn't. It doesn't matter. It's not about who you've been with. It's about who you end up with. Sometimes the heart doesn't know what it wants until it finds what it wants. - I hope you find what you're looking for. - Thank you. - So I can reprimand them, but I can't suspend them. Oh, I can't do either. Uh-huh. Fair enough. [Phone rings] - Hey, Toby. - I called Tallahassee. He can ask you not to come in, but he can't dock your pay. That's not legal. - Very interesting. - Yeah, I also learned some interesting things about how they structure-- - thanks, Toby. - Hey, everyone. Hi. Quite an afternoon, huh? Cathartic in a way. I'm glad that I got to share it with you. It makes you think about what's really important. It's not about showing you're in charge or flexing some sort of authority. It's about forgiveness. And, yes, I'm talking about you three in this desk clump right here. I think that, if you were to apologize to me, then I would revoke your suspension. - I don't think an apology is enough. I really think the only way for me to learn my lesson is to take my suspension. - And I got to take this bad attitude, and I got to go home, and I got to adjust it. And I hope the suspension does that. - Prideful idiots. Watch how it's done. Gabriel, I apologize. - Great. - I kneel before you. - Guys, I would even take a contrite look as an apology. - Humbly taking your hand upon which I kiss to show my contrition. - Guys, to err is human. - Trust is the most important thing to me. Is your name Andy Bernard? What's your real name? Lionel frankenstein? - Will you stop walking for one second? That's it. There's no other secrets. Okay? I mean, yeah, my chest is not naturally hairless, and my parents pay my credit card bill. - How long were you guys together? - A year. - A year? You were together for a year. - Yeah. But that's it. Now you know everything about me. I promise. And if I think of anything else - I think I have to be on my own for a little bit. Like that girl precious in precious: Based on the novel push by sapphire. Okay? - I didn't see that movie. [Chatter] - That was ugly. I'm sorry that you had to see that. - Do they still get paid? - It's tacky to discuss finances. It's best to pretend that this never happened. - Sounds like they just got to go home with pay. - Yeah. - Pathetic. - Very nice. - Can I buy everyone coffees? [Muttering] "Or cookies." - Oh. - What was that? Was that an impression? - All right. - [Imitating gabe] Uh, guys, I'm now going to apologize for the mess that we're in. Because corporate told me to. [Laughter] I just want you to know I laugh like a crazy person. [Laughter] - Okay. You got to be able to-- you got to be able to laugh at yourself. I'm one of the gang. - "I have to go back to the zoo to the stick insect exhibit." [Laughter] - "Ciao." Right? "Ciao. I say ciao 'cause I'm fancy from Tallahassee." [Laughter] - Why don't we say "ciao" to the impressions? All: Ciao. - Ciao. Filming. - Ciao, stick insect. All: Ciao. - God. [groans] - Erin? - Oh. Sorry. I thought everyone was gone. - No, no, I was just watching cookie monster. Finally downloaded. Mind if I sit down? - Yeah. - What's, um - I can't trust Andy anymore. - Oh. Yep. I'm sorry about that. I feel-- I'm sorry I caused that thing. - It's Andy's fault. - Well, yeah, yes. But I still feel sorry. [Sighing] Oh. You know what, I wouldn't worry about Angela. She's-- she doesn't hold a candle to you, Erin. She's old enough to be your mom for one thing, and she's, like, three feet tall. [Laughter] And she wears pioneer women clothing. And I don't think she's ever pooped in her life. And Andy, you know, come on. Andy, his butt looks big in those khakis. - Oh, I like his butt. - You said butt. - You tricked me. - Ahh! - Ahh. [laughter] You said it. - You know who'd you love? Oh, this guy in my neighborhood, Tom dizemore. This is him. "Hey! Hey, Scott!" - Sometimes, telling someone something is hard. - [Shouts nonsense] - Well, at least somebody made her happy on secretary's day. - Hey, Kevin, it's Oscar. I'm looking at the sheet you sent me. And I can't seem to find the column for shipping costs I made the most brilliant the retaliation video. It is so awesome. - I don't get it. - Yeah, I mean, the Count has a very distinct voice. - Yeah. "I vant to count to ten." - But Oscar is an accountant, and the Count counts numbers. Your an accountant too, so, it doesn't Why didn't you do Oscar the grouch that would have been funny. That would have been funny. But the Count is purple, and Oscar wears purple. Oh! Oh! I was just watching that. Did you do that man? Oscar! I am the Count Nailed him. Nailed him! Good work cookie monster. Thank you   - Look at that, heh, nice. - I love cycling. Andy, I feel like a tourist in my own city. I literally can't wait to wake up every morning. - Ok. - She is a beauty. - Can't beat a horse. A horse is a bike that pedals itself. - Oh, look at that, smooth roll. -Yeah - You got it! Lance Armstrong's bike. - Yes! - His ass was on that seat? - All right! - Nice. - No, Mary, that's not his actual bicycle. But it is the same exact model he uses. - I'm on Sheryl Crow's side in that whole thing, So I feel really weird right now. - Michael! - Oh. Yes, I can ride a bike. I take spinning classes three times a month. I think I know how to ride a bike. - Are you sure you once knew how to do this? - I did, yes! I had those extra wheels on the back That support you. Mi-chael! Mi-chael! All: Mi-chael! Mi-chael! Mi-chael! Mi-chael! - Michael! Yeah! - Yeah! - Just steer more now. - Oh, my-- - not the car! - Ow! [grunts] You never forget. Whoo! [cheerful music]   Sync &amp; Corrections by Alex1969 - [exhales] How do I look? - Amazing. How do I look? - Normal. Ugly. - Well, I do the best with what I've got. Let's go. - All right. - Wait, wait, wait, wait for me. It's weird if I come in slightly after. We have a big meeting with the chief buyer For frames select, Steve Nash. - He's not the Steve Nash. He's big, though. He's kind of like Scranton steve nash. - Will you stop trying to put it in terms You think they'll understand? It's condescending. - I'm not doing that. I'm just explaining. - And who is this "the" Steve Nash? - Phoenix sun's point guard? - No. - No? Nothin'? - No, Mr. Jock Hipster. - Well, I'm neither of those things, so - [scoffs] - Whoa. Libby Dirketts got married. Big, red mazel tov to the Libster. Ooh. Says here Dan Becker Fell off the side of Kilimanjaro In a climbing accident. It appears Dan's sherpa survived to tell the tale-- Oh, my god! - What? Is Dan okay? - No, he died. It's broccoli rob. You know this guy. I showed you his picture on facebook. - Yes. - "some Vermont-based alums "can hear 'broccoli' Rob Blatt, '96, "in the state milk lobby's new milk awareness song, "calci-yum, featuring phish's trey anastasio. "says broccoli, 'trey and I had a ton of fun in the studio, And I think you can hear it inhe song'". - Oh, that's great news for your friend. - Yeah. Yeah. It's great. - You know, I forget about milk. This is a terrific reminder. - I was the artsy musical one. And here comes trouble. I had four solos. Broccoli rob had three. Right? Uhh. - Go tell her we're here. You're good with receptionists. - Oh, ha ha. Dwight - Crap. Danny cordray is the worst. - Well, by worst, you mean thet. - The best salesman ever. He works for osprey paper over in throop, Steals more clients from dunder-mifflin than anyone. - So the situation is the worst. - Also, he slept with pam. - No, he didn't. - [mouthing words] - Tell 'em. - Nothing happened. We went on a couple of dates. He never called me again. - What? He never called you? I thought you said it just fizzled. - That's fizzling. I mean, someone has to start the fizzle. - Yeah, I thought you started it. - No, I liked him. For a couple of days. Four years ago. You know I have a kid with you, right? - Ah. - I'm gonna intimidate him. Okay? - Okay, great. I'm just gonna watch. - Watch this. So anyway, she says, "that is the biggest penis I have ever seen." and I said, "I know. "that's why I brought you to the penis museum, Where tickets are $1,000." Well, hello, Danny. - Hey, Dwight. Good to see you. Jim, hey. - How are you? Good to see you too. - What are you doing? - Oh, I'm just here for the coffee. - Oh, like hell you are. - Dwight! - He's not just here for the coffee, Jim.

Stop. - I will see you in ten. Bye! Hold tight. Well, I know a lot of you thought that my sales days Were behind me. And, to be honest, so did I. And the only reason I got out of the sales game Was to be reluctantly called back in. - You don't look reluctant, Michael. You look really eager. - [laughing] no, I don't have time for this. Are you kidding me? - You don't? - No! Okay. All right! -  knockity-knock, don't knock back  Just kidding, you can knock. It's your office. Do you have a minute? - I'm very busy with time-sensitive work. - Not to go all Sherlock Holmes on you, But I can tell by the reflection in your glasses That you're entering points into weightwatchers.com. - If you don't enter them immediately, You forget. What? - I'm starting a band, and I need you on keyboards. - Nah. I play for pleasure. - This is for pleasure. - Wouldn't enjoy that. - I'm willing  pay you. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. - How much? - 60 bucks a session. - That's crazy money.

Why is there a door close button If it doesn't even close the door? How do I feel about losing the sale? It's like if Michael Phelps came out of retirement, Jumped in the pool, belly-flopped, and drowned. You know who we always lose out to? Staples, the big guys. Osprey? They're a small company. They're smaller than we are. What's our excuse? How do we combat this guy? Stanley, how do we combat him? - We sell better? - Okay. You know what? You clearly don't care, so why don't you just leave? - I would like to stay. This pertains to me. - Why don't you go outside andTake a shot of insulin And have a nap, okay? - Why do you always assume I have diabetes? - I don't know. Your frame, your build. Why don't you have a glass of apple juice And tell me you're not a diabetic. - [grunts] - See? I could tell by the sound you made when you stood up That you have--okay. Yes, Phyllis? - I could try to seduce him. - Oh, my god! - I know how we can learn his tricks. What I'm about to show you is of the utmost secrecy. - Is that your office? - Yes, Jim. And with a little tweaky, it becomes a different office. We lure Danny to it and watch him sell. - Ehh - I'm outta here. - This is weird. - You know what this is?

It's not a very good song. - Yeah, well, it'd sound a lot better If you actually sang with some soul. - Oh, I never sing with soul. - That's a lie. - I could sing it. - I just was hoping maybe You'd save youvoice In case we did a novelty song about frogs. - But my voice is unique. Like Bob Dylan. - Okay, three-way argument Between a drummer, a keyboardist, And the front man le singer. Wonder who's gonna win this one.

Sync &amp; Corrections by Alex1969 - Can't tear youself away from "The Office"? You don't have to. There's more, coming up next. -  sun's in her eyes   tongue full of flies   would you like to share my pad  All:  croak, croak, croak      Got it. Okay, let's go. I'm freezing. People, wait, wait, wait. Come back, come back. One fun one. We're gonna do a fun one. One Charlie's angels. One. Let's go. Okay, this is just a Christmas card from your paper supplier. No one's putting this on their fridge. Ooh, I got it, you guys, how 'bout this Michael, what if all the boys are on one side, all the girls are on the other. The boys are, like, "why, I oughta," and the girls are, like, "let's go shopping"? Let's just jump in the air. That's it! That's a picture! Yes! Jump in the air. We're gonna jump in the air. - Here we go. - Okay, one TwoThree Not everyone jumped. Okay, everybody jump in the air this time, please. Here we go. One, two, three. Still some people not jumping. You gotta be kidding me. Who isn't jumping? I'll tell you who. Darryl, Phyllis, Stanley, - Angela, and Oscar. - I am jumping. You are? Let me see you jump. Oh, my God. This is a store-bought camera. This isn't one of those special military-grade cameras that would be able to capture that. I'm freezing. Um, also, Erin is jumping way too early. She's on the ground by "three." I didn't want to miss it. Well, if we all jump really high, we'll be in the air longer. Do that. Here's a question nobody's asking - Is this worth it? - Don't answer that. People, listen up and listen good. We need to just get one picture where we're all in the air at the same time. Yes? - Why? - I believe in us. - We can do this. - Okay, on three, everyone in the air. Three, two, one, zero. We didn't get it. I'm the office administrator now, which means I'm basically being paid to be head of the party planning committee. The first thing I did as head I shut it down. At its worst it was a toxic political club used to make others feel miserable and left out. At its best it planned parties. It hardly looks fake. It's so lush. Why does it smell real? AhGood one. Oh, ho, ho, ho! Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas, little children! Merry Christmas. How's everybody doing today? - Good. - Good. How's the party coming along? - Great. - Are we over budget? - Nope. - No? Good. Did anyone get drunk already? Not yet. Good for you. Angela, lay it on me What's the problem? Nothing. Should be fun. So, Stanley, how big is the bug up your butt today? Pam got those sugar-free cookies I like. I'm doing fine. All right, well, I will be in my office making toys for the good children. Andy? - Yeah? - What you got? It's all good, Santa. Well, that's a relief. Santa's gonna take some much-needed free time. All right. Good! My kids are growing up. As a boss, I look at that and I say great. It is exactly what a boss would hope would happen because that's what I want. That's what every boss wants, is a is a wonderful Christmas with no drama. It's present time, you guys. Happy holidays from your friends at Sabre. We just want to say how grateful we are. Sabre is actively looking for ways to involve me as minority executive trainee. So I suggested choosing the annual Christmas gift to the employees. And they said, "oh, yes. Perfect. Thank you, Kelly. Finally, something for you to do." It's a hello kitty laptop sleeve. Hello kitty's for girls. Nashua got mp3 players. Yeah, I don't even have a laptop. I wonder if these presents would be under as much scrutiny if I were white. - Wow - Come on. I said "I wonder." I didn't say "I think." Kelly, I thought we agreed on fleece blankets. Blankets? What am I, five? Erin and I make great use of ours. Yes, Erin and I are still dating. Why do you ask me so often if we're still dating? I'll take one of those pink pouches. I feel good today. My little girl Jada? It's my turn to have her for Christmas this year. Two years ago I had her, and we had the best time. I TiVoed her favorite shows, some things I've never heard of. iCarly You know who's funny on that show? The friend with the video camera. He's got a nice way of talking. Hey, it's snowing. Oh, my God! It's the first snowfall of Christmas. Is that just so magical for you, little girl? Can you not wait to have a hot chocolate, and cuddle up with papa and tell him about all your Christmas dreams, hmm? It's not even a real snow. Look, it's a dusting. Pitiful. Hey, Dwight. Whoo! Damn it, Jim, you cannot throw snowballs in here! Well, it's not a snowball, 'cause it's only a dusting. Right? Look at that. There's a pebble in there. You could have killed me! Oh, don't be such a baby. Yeah, who's a little girl now? You apologize to me right now. You've got something on your nose. You apologize right now. - No. - Very well, then I challenge you to a snowball fight on the first real snow of winter. You got it. That sounds awesome. Can we all do it? No, Andy, it's a snowball fight. It's not fun. Go get your own thing. Beat it. Jim, let go. Let go. Angela, are you bringing your new boyfriend to the party? I wouldn't subject Robert to that. He's a very busy senator. State senator. I would not expect you to know what it's like to date someone in the public arena. Who are you dating in the public arena? The senator. Oh, right. The state senator. We went to a picnic thrown my the comptroller's wife. Oh, that would be impressive If anyone knew what a comptroller was. Well Do you have any idea how many photographers there are at a ribbon-cutting ceremony? I do. Two. "Angela" "Over here, Angela" "Here. Look here!" Before we kick off the party, I just want to remind everyone that an office party is just that - Yeah! - A party. It's not an excuse to get really drunk or confront someone or have a cathartic experience - of any kind. - Pam? - Pam? - Pam? Wow, there are questions to that. Okay. Um, you know what, no questions. Last item on the agenda, Toby would like to make an announcement. - Hi, guys. - Hi. I just wanted to let you know that I'll be taking a leave of absence starting next week. Because you've been on the lam? Because the "boring police" have been after you, and they finally caught up with you? No, the opposite. I was actually selected to be a juror on a very high-profile case. Yes, the case of the horrible red-headed sad sack. And the verdict it was Toby. And the sentence, death. Death to Toby! Death to Toby! Okay, that's hurtful talk. We've talked about that. You know, I don't interrupt your announcements. You leave these huge pauses in your sentences. - What do you expect me to do? - What's the case, Toby? Well, I really can't talk about it, but it's a very high-profile case. - Is it criminal? - Yes. - Have we heard of it? - I don't know. Is it the middle school teacher who tried to turn her foreign exchange student into a sex slave? - Come on. - Was it the post office guy who rubbed his penis all over the mail? Guys, it's a really big deal. He's rubbing his neck. He's rubbing his neck! - He's rubbing his neck. - Oh, Scranton strangler! I can neither confirm nor deny this. Let's just say I'll be up to my neck in jury duty. That was the worst joke ever. Corporate will be sending someone else to take my place. Okay, good-bye. Good-bye. Uh, Holly flax She comes from the Nashua branch. What? What? Yeah, she'll be starting next week. If you have any questions about the transition, just let me know. Hold on, Holly's coming back here? - Yeah. - Guys, who's Holly? That is a great question, Erin. How do you describe somebody who is at the same time an old friend, and was a lover And was a complicated part of my past, and maybe, just maybe - a part of my future? - Wow. She's one sassy black lady. Holly's coming back, everybody, and we have to have a party. I'm not sure the temporary replacement of an hr rep really warrants a party. You know what, we'll postpone this party until then. This is too important. Cancel this one. - Dwight, get rid of the tree. - Okay. Cancel. We're canceling it. - No, don't throw them out! - No, we have to cancel - We can save that. - No, no, no. We're gonna get fresh for Holly. - I bought these. - These cookies are fine! They're not. Fresh and new. Michael, wait. We don't have We don't have the budget for another party. Well, then, everybody will chip in It'll be fine. I honestly think you're idealizing people here again, Michael. I don't think that's gonna happen. You know what, I'll pay for it. I'll pay for the party. This is way too important. People, Holly's coming back, and this is the most important Christmas party of my life. - So back to work. - Oh, boy. Man, I worked hard. I worked so hard for this! I was after corporate constantly. I emailed Joe. I wrote letters. And you know who I end up owing this to is the Scranton strangler. Thank you. Thank you, Scranton strangler. I love you! You just took one more person's breath away. We have always had good Christmas parties here, as you know, but they've never been cool. The name is bondSanta bond. I'll have an eggnog, shaken, not stirred. Classic Brosnan. SantaWonderful tradition. Everybody loves Santa. Everybody can't get enough of the jolly old man. But that is a myth, because you know what, he is not necessarily a big fat guy with a beard. He's not necessarily an old guy. No one knows what the real Santa Claus God! Ow! Just stop moving your calves so much while you're talking. Well, this year's gonna be different. We're gonna have fun. It's not gonna be tacky. It's going to be You know what, the food is going to be austere. It is not going to be tacky, deli platter food. It's not gonna have a big, fat, gross Santa Claus. It's gonna be a cool, sleek Santa. Maybe I'll bring my boyfriend. - I'll invite him. - Okay. Sure. I mean, unless there's any chance there could be *pss at this party. You never know about the press. Well, I only ask because he's a senator. Could he help us with some parking tickets? I don't think that's appropriate. Well, then he's not a senator. - Yes, he is. - Okay. - Hey. - Hey. We still doing the gifts today? I mean, it is the Christmas party. Well, the classy Christmas party. Yes. But don't get too excited, 'cause I didn't have a lot of time this year. - Me neither. Whew. - Okay. I've been working forever on Jim's present. He always gives me the best Christmas gifts. He'll take a memory or a private joke, and he'll create something totally unique. I love them. So this year I made him something. A comic book. It stars Jimmy Halpert, a mild-mannered paper salesman who, while riding his bike through the forest, is bitten by a radioactive bear becomes a "bear man." Wreaks havoc on the office. It's really good. Okay Oh, no, no, no, no! Fake tree. No! - No, it has the little - Pam, no, no. Holly's coming from new Hampshire. Somebody from new Hampshire looks at that and thinks it's a burning cross. No, no. I want you to go and get a real tree. Take some money. Thank you. Hi, I'm looking for Michael Scott. Yes, that's me. Come on in. There's nothing classier than boring jazz music, I am here to tell ya. And I made a bit of a judgment call. I hired one musician, because I thought, what's better, to hire an entire quartet for half an hour, or one bassist for the entire day?   Hey, any volunteers to come with me to go buy a Christmas tree? I would, but I don't want to get dirty. There might be girls at the party. Why do you always think that girls are gonna be at the party? No one invited girls. It's just us. I will help. Although my 'bridMy hybrid My Prius hybrid, won't fit a tree. Which is ironic, considering how many trees it saves - on a daily basis. - Yeah. I do, however, have a hookup with a dude who has a pickup. Oh, do you mean Darryl? That's a great idea. - I'll ask him. - You know Darryl? Yeah. He works here. We all know him. I should come along, just 'cause he's my You know, he's my hookup. Cool. Come on, now, Justine, look Listen Look, I've been planning this, okay? - You cannot do this, Justine. - I'm not doing it! She told me she wants to have Christmas here. - She did? - Yes. She wants to be around family for Christmas. I don't know I thought I was enough family for my daughter. Don't come in, I'm busy. It's cool, Darryl, I'm here too. Hey, sorry, I really didn't want to come in. It's just that we have to go buy a new Christmas tree, and we're hoping we could borrow your truck. Uh, no. Come on, it'll be fun. We could do doughnuts in the snow on the way back. No. Thank you for your interest in my truck. Okay. Sorry. We'll leave you ale. Hey [Sighs you know what, I could use a breath of fresh air. Let's do it. When Holly gets here, I want you to be very helpful to her. I've looked her up online There's nothing about her. She's made no impression on the Internet. She doesn't need an Internet presence You just know. Oh - Hey. - Hi. What the hell are you doing here? You're supposed to be in the courthouse. We're on recess. I came for the party. Hi. - Hey, everyone. - Hi, Toby. What does the strangler look like? Is he gorgeous? He looks gorgeous in the drawings. - Yeah. - That scowl. I can't talk about it or I'll get removed from the jury. And then he will come back here and replace Holly, so stop asking him questions. I know people are only this excited to talk to me because of the trial. But they talk to me for a while, and maybe people realize I have something to say. And then one day, we're just talking. You've reached the voice mail of Dwight Kurt Schrute. Please leave Raaaaugh! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Stop! OhOh! I have no feeling in my fingers or penis. But I think it was worth it. Aah! Um, I was laying on the ground, defenseless, and he just kept throwing 'em until he exhausted himself. And, uhThen "How 'bout icing it? Lol. Dwight." - Hi. - Hello. Is there any way I can get a hand with these, please? I'm really sorry, I can't help you. I'm waiting for my boss' pretty friend to arrive. There she is. Hey. Erin, would you help her, for God's sake? Oh, you're Holly! Of course. Sorry. Hello. Well, well, well, if it isn't Michael Scott. You old bastard. Well, I never thought I'd see your face around these parts, you old bastard! Well, I did show my face around these parts, you old bastard. Why, you're some sorta wise guy, huh? I most certainly am. - Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk, nyuk! - Unnnnnngh! - D'oh! - Oh, Homey. OkayHolly's back. Hi. Hi. Oh, huggy monster! Oh, not the huggy monster! I don't want to die! I don't want to die! I don't want to die! Wow. Well, everybody, - you remember Holly. - Hi. Did you bring us anything from Nashua? Oh, yeah. I brought some maple candy. But I have to admit, I got a little hungry on the drive, - and I ate some of them. - That's adorable. - Would you put those out? - To throw out? Or put out, like, six pieces for everyone? Oh, it's so nice to be back. It looks beautiful in here. Super-classy. It's like a party for limousine drivers. Well, you came on the day of our Christmas party. Oh, it's fabulous. I love what you did! Isn't it wonderful? We love it here. Don't you love it? All right, let me show you to your desk. I show you to your dayyy-esk! Watch out for my guns. They're both loaded. What kind of guns do you have? - Six-shooter? - Aww This is weird. I can't believe you're here. This feels like you never left. - Doesn't it? - Yeah, kind of. Yeah. - Oh, God. - Oh, and you have a Woody. Bah! - OhI love - Aj gave me that. Well, that's understandable. Still raw. - Woody your favorite character? - Mm-hmm. You know who my favorite character in toy story is? - Andy's mom. - Why? Because without Andy's mom, there's no plot. And without any plot, there is no movie. That is a really good point. Aj said he hadn't seen any of the toy story movies. - You're kidding me. - No. I know. I'm going, "what? Are you serious?" - What a douche bag! - Get a life! Get a Yeah. Good riddance. We sat down and we watched them all in one day. Now he's the biggest toy story fanatic ever. - Good for him. - Next day I found him in my bed. Really? That's creepy. How did Aj get in your house? We live together. Oh, you do? He had a little note pinned to him that said, "you've got a friend in me." - Yeah, Randy Newman's the best. - Yeah. - I love him. - Me too.  Christmas tree, Christmas tree   won't you be my Christmas tree?  Hey, how about this one? Ehh, seems a little full of itself, right? Kind of a pretty boy. What if we got a really beat up one, like on Charlie brown. And we just loved it for what it is? Maybe. I mean No, she be talking to your mom or something. This is my daughter too, Justine! You seem to think Oh Pick a damn tree already. Um, hey, Darryl, listen, it's none of my business, but if I couldn't have Cece for Christmas, I'd be really upset too. I don't have kids or anything, but if my grandmother ever dies, I'm going to kill myself. Jada don't want to spend Christmas with me. She told her mom it wasn't as much fun. How could she say that? You know, I took her to the toy store to buy her own presents. Well, Darryl, no kid wants to buy their own Christmas presents. Her mom wants me to take her to mass. I guess that's something to do. No, you should have her mom do the boring Christmas stuff on her time. You should be associated with the fun parts of Christmas. How do I do that? Bring her to the party. Yeah, we'll have Santa, and we'll play games with her. It'll be a lot of fun. Yes! You'll be Mr. Christmas by the end of the night. Hey, guys, the tree's here. - Hey. - Nobody hug me I'm covered in tree sap, so Why would someone hug you? Hey there, Jada. Nice to see you again. I'm Santa Claus. Welcome. Are you serious? It's a sophisticated take. He doesn't look like Santa Claus. No, he doesn't. I told her Santa would be here. Yeah, well, I was told that Holly would be here, single and ready to date. - And we all got misled. - Who told you that? Nora Ephron, in every romantic comedy ever made. So is it an open relationship? Oh, God, no. Well, you're almost 40. Oh, do you not want kids? Oh, I want kids. I really want kids. But Aj and I are practically engaged. We talk about spending our lives together. - So where's the ring? - Kelly! Um, how are you adjusting to the move? Nobody cares about that. Look, you have to make him commit, or kick his butt to the curb. You guys, I don't think any of us are really qualified to be giving Holly personal advice about her love life. Yeah, I mean, maybe Holly's not in any position to be shooing guys away. I don't get it. I'm sorry. I just I don't get it. Okay, listen, I'm gonna tell him that if he doesn't propose by the end of this year, we're over. - Wow, an ultimatum. - Yeah. It doesn't really seem like you. That is a great idea. Ultimatums are key. Basically, nobody does anything for me anymore unless I threaten to kill myself. Don't. Stop Dwight! - Dwight, stop! - Oh, no. Oh, no! - Stop! - Oh, no. - Yes, taste my wrath! - Okay. Okay - You like that? - Seriously! Okay. Okay. Yes, I have a wig for every single person in the office. You never know when you're gonna need to bear a passing resemblance to someone. I just want it to stop. So cool, right? There's no connection between - the origin story and the quest. - Okay. We need to know who Jimmy Halpert was before he was bitten by the bear. Otherwise it's the bear's quest. Okay, well, I just sorta meant, like, cute, right? Well, did you come here for help, or did you come here for me to tell you how great it is? I mean, help, if it's something simple, like add page numbers or laminate it or It sounds like you know what you want. It's also a little derivative of a serial called bear man. Did you look that up? - No. - Okay. - Oh, Jim. Hey. - Hey, Toby. There's this female stenographer at the courthouse - No way. - Who looks exactly like you. - That's incredible. - Yeah. No, it's uncanny. You know what's crazy? I can't reconnect with you right now. Hold on one second. Oh! Excuse me. I guess there are just some people who you stay together with when you transfer, and some people you don't. And that's just the way it is. And I can be mature about that. It's so cold. Even with my coat on. Maybe your senator boyfriend has a blanket in his car for screwing Americans. Yet another opportunity where a blanket would have come in handy. You guys, this has to stop. Someone could have really gotten hurt. What if Meredith was taking her smoking break below that window? You know what would have happened? The shards of glass would have shaved her face right off. And, yes, it might have been funny, but it also would have been incredibly tragic. I could not agree more. And I just want to state for the record that I am intending to sue Jim for acute psychological distress. What are you talking about? You're the one terrorizing me. With snowballs, Jim? With Fluffy little snowballs? No. I thought we were just playing. Dwight's right. What you did was dangerous and inappropriate. Mmm, mmm. Mm-hmm. I'm really surprised at you guys. Last time I was here, you were both best friends. All this arguing reminds me of a very funny story. You see this on my desk? Know who gave me this? My girlfriend Tara, who lives in New York city. - Wait, what girlfriend? - I haven't told you about her. I find that unlikely. You email me when you get a new zit. I'm a man in my mid-40s and I still get zits. I think that's pretty interesting. But you know what, I am not on trial here. The Scranton strangler is. So anyway, we have this great weekend, and she drives me to the airport, and we get to JFK, but I'm flying out of Laguardia. So we laugh and laugh and laugh, and then we spend the rest of the day walking around slomo drinking latte. And at the end of the day, she gives me this, and she says, "Michael, maybe next time, you should take a cab." I didn't know you had a girlfriend. I do. She is. Did you see her face? Well, it seems to me that there is a person sitting out there in the annex that still has feelings for Michael g. Scott. And it ain't Tara. So you went homemade this year. - Yep. - Yeah. Money problems Is that what this is about? I mean, oh, dear, I don't think we can help you out. No, no. Jim had a great year, actually. I just wanted to get your opinion. Are you good at homemade? Look at this. Yeah. Who did this? It's obvious to me I'm not welcome here, but somebody better tell me who did this, or else I'm leaving. Well, I don't think Erin seems to like you. That's not true. I don't know her enough to make a decision even. What happened? What happened? Toby, what did you do? I think Toby's very jealous of all the attention you've been getting. No, I would never ever do anything like that. But it does seem like something you would do. Oh, really? Turn it on me. Well, isn't that nice? Thank you very much. Wait, wait, guys, listen. Toy story is all about toys that come to life when people aren't looking. You don't think It's not possible That Woody did this to himself? It is Christmas. No, it really seems like something Michael would do. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Well, the fact that you would think that points to the possibility that it is probably not me. And that I have been framed. Why would anyone frame you for that? Okay, I'm sorry, why are we discounting this whole "Woody came to life" thing so quickly? AaaaahhAhh, Ahh! Surprise! It was part of the party. - Pretty funny, huh? - You think this is funny? I don't. But someday I think we will laugh about this - When we tell our kids - Yikes. - Oh, my God. - All right! Shh. Okay You know what, Holly, I didn't mean to do it. It was an accident. An accident borne of jealous feelings. Michael, you have to let this go. I'm with someone else. I don't feel that way anymore. Oh, really? Well, you certainly seemed jealous when I told you about my fake girlfriend. That's what Jim and Dwight thought. Okay, hey, hey, hey No, fake girlfriends are always wrong. You made up a fake girlfriend to see if I'd get jealous? And you destroyed a gift my boyfriend gave me? What is the matter with you? When you got transferred, and I drove you up to Nashua, you said, "Michael, I love you, but I can't do this." But then, with this other guy, you don't have any problem with a long-distance relationship, do you? And you know what, that is what is the matter with me. Michael, I'm sorry. And we did this whole stupid party for you. No. You guys, it wasn't my fault. Nothing is ever your fault. Just like when you ate those maple candies that you brought for us! I really think you're better off. Mmm. Erin, would you do me a favor and find my street clothes for me, please? Yeah. Is she an amazing cook or something? "Hey, pickles, Merry Christmas. "Open immediately? Love, Swiss cheese. Damn it, Dwight! Didn't think your affectionate nicknames would be your undoing, did you, Jim? Let that be a lesson to you all. So do they bring in food, or do you get to go out? No, they bring it in. You lucky son of a bitch. I have been trying to get on jury duty every single year since I was 18 years old. To get to go sit in an air-conditioned room downtown, judging people while my lunch is paid for That is the life. Daddy, I'm bored. Can I read my book in your office? Sure, sweetie. Jada, Darryl, I'm so glad I found you guys. A Grinch stole the star from on top of the Christmas tree and is hiding it in the warehouse somewhere. You want to go help me find him? Oh, my goodness.   I am the mean old Grinch. The little girl who wishes to win back the Christmas star must first succeed at these challenges. Ohh, that sounds fun and christmasy, you mean old Grinch. What kind of challenges? Waahhh Something like an obstacle course, Mr. Grinch? No. You must answer topical political question something like an ob"how many congressmeninch? "Is the state of Pennsylvania guaranteed? And what other state has the equal number?" I don't know. Do you know the other state? Maybe the Grinch hid the Christmas star, and we could ask for clues, and he'll tell us if we're hot or cold. The star has been hidden. Is the little girl hot or cold? Well, it turns out she's burning up because the star is right behind her ear! And the game's over seconds later. I'm so glad you could come. It's nice. I know. Hey, everybody, this is my boyfriend, senator Robert Lipton. Hi. Senator, it's an honor. I'm Angela's friend Oscar. Oscar. A pleasure. Robert seems great. He's very handsome, firm handshake, he's gay, good sense of humor. - Hi. - Hello. I'm, uh I'm Aj. I'm here to see Holly. It's kind of a surprise. I know who you are, and I think you should go.

Thank you. - For me? - Yes. - Thank you very much. - Mm-hmm. I don't know if you guys have had a chance to use the new parking meters that accept credit cards, but Robert was instrumental in that legislation. Wow, that's awesome! A real David and Goliath story. I'm just so touched that she's so interested in my work. I am. The real problem is the teachers' union. - Zip it, Meredith. - No. You tell me why my kid is 17 and still can't read. Hey, who's in charge of making drinks around here? Is there a bartender? You are. You make your own drink. I'll make it. What are you drinking? An "f" train to Brooklyn. Extra bitters. I don't know how to make that. Okay, well, I'll just stick with my Mohito. And you know those annoying geese at the park? Well, he's helping eradicate them as well. I mean, I think they've really become a pest. - Annoying. - Yes. I don't think he's in the ceiling, babe. Well, uhI don't think any of us really know. All right. Is it Is it pebbles from the beach in Jamaica? Ooh, go easy with the shaking. Oh, my God. You like it? I love it. Yep, I do make great Christmas gifts. But I couldn't make that. All right, my turn. Oh, um, it's just I didn't I didn't have a lot of time, so that's just a place holder. Right. Of course. "The adventures of Jimmy Halpert." OhMyGod. This is awesome! That's my bike. That's my desk. And that is my daughter. I mean Better office policy up there. It's not as fun as Scranton. But it should be the same policy as us. Michael, wait. Oh, hey, hey, no, don't run. You're gonna slip. - That's good advice. - Yep. I read this story about a woman who slipped on some black ice, and she hit her head and went into a coma forever. And then every day, her husband went and visited her in the hospital until she died. That's a sad story. Yeah, well, at least he was married. Oh, okay, Michael, slow down. Everything's gonna be okay. No, it's not. It's not. Oh, man, I can tell you confidently that it is not gonna be okay. I shouldn't tell you this, but Aj won't commit to Holly. And she's gonna tell him that if he doesn't propose to her by the end of the year, it's over. Really? Really. And I don't know about you, but I don't know of a lot of happy marriages that start off with an ultimatumDo you? No. So just be patient. Yeah. I mean, I can wait till then. Come here. I don't want you to fall. I surrender. I do not accept your surrender. There's only one way that I would ever relent. Anything. You got it. You hit Pam in the face with a snowball while I watch. You're a psychopath. I'll take that as a no. I was in the mall, and I saw that, and I thought it had your name written all over it. Michael, this is the gift that corporate gave us that I picked out. You're re-gifting this to me. No, that's not No, I went to the mall and I picked that out especially for you. Oh, yeah? Well, show me the receipt. From the mall. That This is a fast food receipt from April. WellThat God, how many number nines did you order? Is everyone here kind of mean? Oh, I think everyone's on edge because of the strangler trial. - Oh. - Hey I'm so glad you came down. It's been so much harder than I expected. Hey, what happened to Woody? Oh, okay, get ready for this. You're not gonna believe it. I was making salad, and he fell right into the dressing. I mean, there was salad dressing all over him. - He smells awful. - It was blue cheese dressing. Great. - Hey, Mike. - Hey. We wanted to give you something. - Oh. - Merry Christmas. Thank you. A hostess apple pie! This is my favorite breakfast. How did you know that? Thank you very much. - What do you say? - You're welcome. Oh, you know, I seem to remember that Santa promised that he would listen to all the gifts you wanted for Christmas. Didn't he say that? I think I know where he is. - A trampoline - Mm-hmm. - Video games. - Video games. - A horse. - A horse. Are you sure you don't want a pony? - You want a real horse. - Mm-hmm. All right. You have to pick up after them. Hey, sorry. I'm ready. I don't want to go. Oh Come on, bear man. Come on. Have you ever seen 'em do that? I'm sorry. I had no idea. No, it's it's okay. - Okay. - Oh, my God. Oh, my God. No, no, no, no. - Okay, this is it. - What? - Go! Go! Go! - What? What is it? What? Oh, my God! Honey? Jim? Jim! In the end, the greatest snowball isn't a snowball at all. It's fear. Well, I'm moving to Colorado to start my new life with Holly. Just up here getting used to the altitude. - Michael? - Yes? I've got a treat for you. Thank you. Like a butler. Colorado specialty-- Rocky Mountain oysters. Wow, those do not taste like oysters. That's because they're not oysters. They're bull testicles! I cut them off fresh this morning! Sick freak. What is wrong with you? What is wrong with you. I'm the sick freak? After what you did, you expect to be buttled? After you didn't recommend me? Dwight, I don't own Dunder Mifflin, okay? The job was not mine to give. Look, I need your advice on something. I am told that there are bears in the rockies. Where did you hear that? Obvious XM radio? Well, I was just thinking that maybe I should keep a salami in my pocket Great idea. In order to feed the bears. Especially if you think that life would be better without legs! How do you mean? Black bears can smell a salami at five Miles, Michael. What are you thinking? And they run faster than a horse. So if you were thinking about outrunning them on a horse, I would try a cheetah. You in tight pants, Michael, are a salami to a black bear. - Do you understand? - Mm-hmm. You're like a giant walking salami. Okay, so no salami in the pants. How about a pepperoni? Any kind of meat you can possibly name. Okay. You're not gonna take all your toys, are you? I mean, you don't-- You don't have a job lined up, so It's not like you have a desk to put 'em on. Well, I have interviews. That's nice. What about that truck? Can I have this little truck? Was thinking thinking I might glue a stapler on top or put a hole here and stick pens in it. You okay? Yes. Yes, you know what, take my favorite truck, sure. You know what, uh It's your last couple of days. I'm gonna get out of your hair. Oh, you don't-- I will be in the break room. Okay, that sounds good. Thank you. Dead man walking. Sad? No. No, no. I don't leave till tomorrow, so tomorrow I will be a wreck. - Stay away from Erin. - Hey. I'm your boss. Why don't you, uh, stay away from me? No, I'm gonna stand where I want, okay? You don't want to get on my bad side. I've seen some horrible things. I own over 200 horror movies. Okay, that's so weird! Just go away! No, you go away. Hi, Jim. You guys are filming people when they go to the bathroom now? How about cupcakes? Please. - What's wrong with cupcakes? - Everything. There they are. The party planning committee together again. Well, we all wanted to plan your good-bye party. We thought this would be easier. We thought. It's an experiment. The three of us have all been chairmen before. So this is the dream team. Hey! What are you saying? The dream team and Meredith. We decided on the ice cream. Mint chocolate chip-- Your favorite. Yeah, that was a surprise. You know what? I'm thinking maybe we should get ice cream that everybody will like. How about vanilla? Let's get vanilla. Okay. Tomorrow, I want everybody to have a good time. No drama. And as for today, just a typical day. All right? Should we get toppings? - What do you like, Pam? - What? What kind of topping would you like? Hot fudge? Sounds good. Fudge it up. I bought this for myself. And yesterday, they gave me this. I still need something to drink out of, though. Attention, everyone. Before I leave tomorrow, I would like to reveal a secret that I have kept for over 20 years. Secret about Phyllis. Please, Michael. When Phyllis was in high school, she was so cute. And she still is. I thought he knew about the baby I gave away. Look, Michael, it's a going-away present so your hands won't get cold. It's almost done, but you can't get them wet, and they can't be dry-cleaned either. You have to hand wash without water, wring dry gently, and use a hair dryer on cool. Sounds great. I just think it's great. Oh, I have gifts as well. And I will start by giving the first gift to Phyllis. Phyllis, you are shy and sweet, and you don't often speak your mind, but you should, because you have great ideas. So, Phyllis, I am giving you this so you can always remember to speak your mind. Gee, thanks, Michael. - You're welcome. - It's cute. Stanley, you love your sudoku and your puzzles. I bestow upon you My felt. May you never lose the fun-loving quality in life. Where's the rest of it? It's got no balls. Well, okay. And Andy. Andy, who needs confidence that he is a great salesman, I give you my clients. Our ten most important accounts. - Wow. - Yeah, wow. You know I'm the worst salesman here, right? But you're the best salesman on the inside. What does that even mean? You sold us all on Andy-- A product that nobody wanted. I'm gonna lose 'em. You're not going to lose them. I promise you that I will. Just do your best. I have faith in you. Gimme those clients. No. Do you believe that? I've given up expecting Michael to do the right thing or the decent thing or even the comprehensible thing. I used to be obese. Once you've conquered obesity, everything else is easy. Life literally moves in slow motion. I'm not saying I'm superman, but let me just put it this way, if I were shot in the head, I'm pretty sure everything would be fine. I almost welcome it. Kevin, I have something for you. You know who that is? Don't be a caricature, Kevin. Never be a caricature. How did that feel when I tore that up? - Better? - Good. Stand up. You will be thin. You won't drool over pizza like an animal anymore. But, I-- You will find love. Michael, I'm pretty much okay with who I am now. Don't be. You should never settle for who you are. Oscar, Oscar, Oscar. Oscar, you are a-- Michael, I just lost Porter hardware! I just-- I lost 'em. Okay, you know what? Just do your best, buddy. Okay, Oscar, you are very smart, and you have a gigantic education, and I think of you as my scarecrow, because you gave me a brain. So that's why I made you this. Thank you, Michael. It's beautiful. It looks like It looks like it was made by a two-year-old monkey on a farm. And he just He just accepted it, that I That I put all this work into it. Oh, man. He-- He has the lowest opinion of me of anybody. Was it just me, or did you think we were gonna have sex at some point? It was just you. How would you have wanted to do it? I--don't. Okay, you know what? Inappropriate, because I am engaged happily, and you, you have landed yourself a senator. State senator. Mm-hmm. Bravo. - Brava. - Bra--? Do you want to see some pictures? I just got these. Sure. Um, these are-- Okay, um, this is us at the theater. Ohh! And, uh, antiquing. Oh, rollerblading. Rollerblading. Who's that? Who's that guy? Oh, that's Thomas, Robert's aide. I guess this could be the one, huh? Yeah. Yeah. - Hey. - Hey. Um, I'm gonna be dropping in on one of our biggest clients this afternoon, and I could use some backup. Let's rip it up, homes. All right. Boom. Walk away, bitch. - Oh, um, Michael. - Hmm? Uh, where do you want your last paycheck sent? Last paycheck? Do you have an address yet in Colorado? No. What town do Holly's parents live in? I'm not sure. Um, MountainTon, I think. Sounds beautiful. You should do more stuff like that. I'm going to. Hey. It's almost your last day. Come on. Sit with us. No, I'm almost done. - You sure? - Yeah. So I'm going to Carbondale this afternoon to get a new bulk shredder. Finally. That old shredder sucked. It's a good shredder. It just keeps breaking. Yeah, and it won't shred magazines. It's not supposed to shred magazines, Kevin. I know. Did you break the shredder, Kevin? No. It's just that old shredder sucks. Just get one that'll shred magazines. I don't think any of them are supposed to shred magazines. I can't-- I can't do this. All the channels are gonna be different there. I'm not gonna be able to find my shows. I'm not going to start improv at level one. I don't think my credits are gonna transfer. And you know what? I just figured out where I was supposed to go to vote. I gotta call her. And I'm going to tell her that I cannot come. Hello there. Hi. What is the name of our town? Boulder. Is something wrong? Are you okay? No. No, I just needed to hear your voice. Oh, you mean this? Yeah. Yes, my hero. I'll pay the rent. Okay, my mom's looking at me like she has no sense of humor. It's a joke. Oh, I miss you. Well, I'll see you tonight. I'll pick you up outside baggage claim. Okay, I'll see you tonight. I love you. I love you, too. Yeah, so I know I told everybody that tomorrow is my last day, but I'm-- I'm gonna be leaving tonight. I, uh, head to the airport at 4:00. And, uh, I have said good-bye to half of them. Well, you know Michael, I have a brother, in Boulder. Rory Flenderson. You should look him up. Okay. Okay? Ahem, Kelly? Kelly? Kelly? What? If I just went away right now, would that be the best gift that I could give you? Yes, please. Please go away and stop using that weird, slow voice. She was once my girl, and she is your girl now. Wow. Yeah. This is totally unnecessary. You're not prone to seizures? No. So Michael said we can do whatever we want cake-wise. What do we want? - Erotic. - See? This is what happens. You can't let a street dog into the house. Mmm, let's hear her out. I would, uh, like to hear more about these cakes. I know these Ethiopians that run a cake shop. Good God. They make these cakes that are wild. I mean They show everything. I don't--I don't think we want a-- No, I know what you're thinking, but it's not just black. They do it all. And the women on these cakes, they're not just guys' fantasies. They have real, full women. It is refreshing. Okay, don't turn this into some feminist issue. As a person who buys a lot of erotic cakes, it just feels good to be represented on one. You know what? I think we should get some other input. I think we should do cupcakes. I am one of the few people who looks hot eating a cupcake. Yeah, cupcakes, that's what I said. No. I am not cleaning up a bunch of uneaten cupcake bottoms. You know, we don't really care about your opinion. You're just a tie-breaker. Um, Pam? Oh, hey, Michael. I'm just gonna go to Carbondale to price some shredders. I'll see you later. Okay. Gabe! I need to talk to you. You can't be in here. This is a ladies' bathroom. No, Erin, I respect your privacy, but I will follow you in here Every time you go if that's what it takes. Hey, creed. Not cool, man. I really think you should leave. Someday, you are going to tell our grandchildren about how their grandfather won you back in a women's room. Gabe, can we talk about this later? I have to go. I have to go. Just read the letter under your windshield wiper. It explains everything. - Okay. - Okay? Do you want-- - Gabe! Well. Here's the thing, Rory. I think you guys would hit it off in an odd way. I could bring him a welcome basket. I'll surprise him. Okay, well, you should give him a little time to settle in, but Does he like jams? My shelves are overflowing with preserves. Well, no, he hates jams. Darryl. Hey. I would like to give you the only copy of somehow I manage, unfinished. If there's anybody here who can finish it, it's you. That's sweet, Mike. Let's see here. Here's a chapter called "gum." - Mmm. - With one sentence. "Everybody likes the guy who offers them a stick of gum." Mm-hmm. It's true. Darryl, I have one last wish. I would like to use the baler. No. Can't let you do that, Mike. - No problem. - Sorry. - Worth a try. - All right. Darryl said I could use the baler because I'm leaving. No. All right, guys, well, see ya later, warehouse. Catch you on the flippety-flip. All right then, see you guys. Catch you later, warehouse. See you on the flippety-flip. Catch you on the flippety-flip. Catch you guys on the flippety-flip. Come on. Okay. So what's our approach? You a veteran? Do I have a month to live? You gonna get married tomorrow? What? I thought we'd just talk about our customer service and exceptional paper quality. That's stupid. Well, what do I know? I know. What you know? We gotta get psyched up. Okay, guy? Let's get psyched. Is there an animal shelter on the way? Yeah. Awesome! Ani-ani-shelto. Here we come. Andy, do you know how to high-five? Yeah. 'Cause if you do, now's the time. All right. Not while I'm driving. Catch you guys Catch you guys on the flippety-flip. Flippety-flip. Flippety-flip. Really? Okay, see you guys. You know how I met Bennet and got started on my ladder of success? No, I don't. Walkin' along, out of workAgain, thinking to myself, I've only got enough cash to buy a sandwich or get drunk. And I see this guy trying to steal this lady's dog. So I grab the dog, he runs off. She's so grateful, she hires me. Aw, wow. Gimme that dog! It's not your dog! Yeah. - Again. - Oh, okay. Gimme that damn dog, you [Bleep] Thief! It's her dog! Don't ever do it again! You hear me? You feel that energy? - Mm-hmm. - Yeah? Whoo! Yeah. Okay, again. I know that Gabe is young and hot and everything, and he's begging me to reconsider, but II just think I'm in love with someone else. Kevin? Andy. I wish I knew who my birth mother was so she could just tell me who to choose. Maybe neither. I'm not attracted to Kevin. Erin, listen to me. You shouldn't rush into this at all. And you know why? Because you are beautiful, and you are fun, and you are smart. And when the right guy comes along, you'll know it. You will. Hey. And you know what? You don't need a mom, because you have my number and you can call me anytime. Extension 147. - N - I know. Okay. Okay. Did you want the 2726 or the 2730? Phyllis? Phyllis, are my mittens done? - No. No. I'm on a sale-- Okay, listen, it's 2:00 P.M. From now until 4:00, your priority is knitting. Knit like the wind. Okay. Dwight, I will be leaving tomorrow. Yes? So I wanted to give you that. It's a letter of recommendation. This is gonna be good. Ahem. "To whom it may concern." Good, real personal. Thanks, Michael. "The dictionary defines 'superlative' "as 'of the highest kind, quality, or order, surpassing all else or others; Supreme.'" that's great. If I wanted the dictionary definition, I'd buy a dictionary. "I define it as Dwight Shrute. "As a sales executive, as a leader, "as a man, and as a friend, "he is of the highest kind, quality, and order; Supreme." Lots more like that. Really repetitive. What's this? "2:45 behind the building, paintball." Come on, come on! Give it up! Yaah! I would like to start by just saying that I have not worked with Mr. Andy Bernard here for very long. But I can say that he is no Michael Scott. I can't sit here and tell you that he's gonna be a success. Uh, I can't sit here and tell you that he's even the best man for the job. But I can say this. He's got potential. Sure. You know, I always say, "go big or go home." You go with this guy, you could be making the biggest mistake of your life. Or the biggest good decision of your life. It's either gonna be the best thing you ever did, or the worst thing you ever did. If you want some boring, white bread clock-watcher, who's gonna get you your paper when you ordered it for the agreed-upon price, Andy's not your guy. You ever play Russian roulette? Time to spin the chamber, Boris By signing up for another year. Uh, what happened to you? You should see the other guy. Jim, where is Pam? Uh, she's still pricing the whatevers The shredders. But it is already 3:00. Right. Whether you're scared of dying or dying alone or dying drunk in a ditch, don't be. It's going to be okay. Yeah, I was tripling up. There's not enough time in the day to have a special moment with everybody. And you, why are you still here? I'm either gonna quit today or stay to make sure that Andy's career is destroyed. No, you are not going to quit today. For goodness sake, this is not going to be your last day at the office. Everybody gets dumped, Gabe. Can I give you a piece of advice? A little cover-up on your Adam's apple will make it appear smaller, which will make you look less like a transvestite. That is cold, sir. Absolutely cold. You know what? It was a complete waste of my time. Uh, Deangelo, I'm, uh I forgot my bag, so I'm gonna I'll meet you in the car. Okay, whatever. Sir. I'd just like to apologize for that. I could tell you that he has a steel plate in his head, or that he's crazy, but the truth is, I think he's just a terrible salesman. And I want you to know that if you re-up with us, anything you need, day or night, I will be the one to take your call. Keep talkin'. Yes. Okay. All right. No. Well, thank you. Thank you. All right.

Let's do this! Yes. What is this about? - What is this meeting about? - Mm-hmm. All right. Well Okay. Here we are in the conference room. Once again. And I just wanted to call you all here together because I have something important Well, there's two things, actually. Okay, first, I would like a whereabouts on Pam, and, secondly, Phyllis, how are those mittens coming? Because I would actually like to bring them home and pack them, and I am leaving for the day at 4:00. They're almost done, but my knuckles are swelling a little, and I can't-- Well, power through the arthritis, Phyllis. You can do it. Is that it? Is that it? No. No. There's a special guest that I would like to invite to say one last goodbye, so here he comes. He's coming right in. Hi, everybody! It's ping! And I'm here to say goodbye to all you wonderful people. Thank you, everybody! You've been so wonderful. We were such a good-- I "rove" you all. I "rove" you very much. Hey, can I talk to you for a second? Sure. See you later! So I've been meaning to tell you. I want to take you out for lunch. For your last day. What do you think? Tomorrow? Lunch? You and me? Okay. You're not leaving tomorrow. You're leaving today, right? Maybe. Wow, so that's it, huh? Just 4:00 and you are gone for good. Why am I so sad? Am I doing the wrong thing? Absolutely not. It's just that sometimes goodbyes are a bitch. T-shirt idea. "Goodbyes stink." Okay. All right. So James Halpert You started with this company As a fine young man. You know what I think we should do? I think we should just save the goodbyes for tomorrow. At lunch. Oh. Okay. And then tomorrow I can tell you What a great boss you turned out to be. Best boss I ever had. Oh, shoot. That's my cab. - All right. - All right. Listen, Michael, I really-- I did text Pam, but I know. It's okay. Just give her a hug, all right? I will see you tomorrow at lunch. I am looking forward to lunch. And hearing about what a great boss I am. You got it. Okay. Okay. Phyllis. Mm-hmm. Oh, they're still not done. Oh, no, no, no. Let me see. Oh, Phyllis. Nice try. I love 'em. See ya tomorrow, boss. Later, guys. Well, got almost everybody, so Holly's my family now. She's my family. And the babies that I make with her will be my children. The people that you work with are just, when you get down to it, your very best friends. They say on your deathbed you never wish you spent more time at the office, but I will. Got to be a lot better than a deathbed. I actually don't understand deathbeds. I mean, who would buy that? Well, I guess this is it. Hey, will you guys let me know if this ever airs? Thank you. All right. Oh. This is gonna feel so good getting this thing off my chest. No, he wasn't sad. He was full of hope. About Colorado. And he was hoping to get an upgrade as an awards member. And he said he was just real excited to get home and see Holly. Well, if he's not gonna make it, at least we should go ahead and eat the cake. Yeah. I, for one, love the corners. Why did I just do that? This is not even that good. I don't even-- I don't even want it. I had cake for lunch. No, you know what? I've been good. I deserve this. What am I doing? Come on, Deangelo. Hey No! No! The Office is all new for the rest of the season, so let's see what's new next week. Christmas time is here! Wow! Thanks, guys. That sounded amazing. Hi, I'm * Bernard and I am the first office Santa ever to make holiday wishes come true. Who's excited to get their holiday wishes? Holiday wishes What's that, Stanley? We know exactly what holiday you're referring to. It is important to be mindful of all belief systems at our holiday party. I've been here 18 years and I've suffered through some weird, thematic christmases. A Honolulu Christmas, a Pulp Fiction Christmas, a Muslim Christmas, Moroccan Christmas, Mo Rocca Christmas. I don't want it. Christmas is Christmas is Christmas is Christmas. I got Stanley tickets to see Lewis Black for his birthday. Might not have been the best idea. I don't want no kwanzaa wreath. I don't need a dreidel in my face-- That's its own thing. And who's that black Santa for? I don't care. I know Santa ain't black. I could care less. I want Christmas. Just give me plain baby Jesus lying in a manger Christmas. What is the status on my wish? Fulfilled. Brought my bicycle so I can be your designated driver later in the event that you drink too much, which is by no means required. What about my wish that we don't have to attend meetings that degrade our sense of adulthood? That, I cannot do. But I did get you an acre of property on the moon. Where, dark side or light side? Light side. Is it by the sea of tranquility? As a matter of fact, yes. Directly adjacent. - Beachfront. - Thank you, Andy. So whose wish is next? Oh, what about Santa's wish? My biggest wish is that you all get along well with Jessica. Come on, guys, Jessica. Jim, tell them who Jessica is. She's not your grandmother, is she? Ugh, gam gam's name is Ruth, Jim. You should know. I introduced you on speaker phone that time. Jessica is my super serious girlfriend who is seriously awesome and seriously sexy. Only thing that's not serious, by the way, our repartee. That's great. When you know, you know. Hey, what's Ruth's deal, man? Totally out of your league. So, in summation, ho ho ho, please be nice to Jessica, and mistletoe is not an excuse for sexual assault. And don't go near gam gam. I love Jessica, and I haven't even met her yet. It's like, we don't even need to meet, you know? I already love you. Stay home. I just want you to know that I will be mean to Jessica, if you want me to be. Oh, no, no, it's fine, Kelly. It's really no problem. I was already planning on being mean to her. That's okay, I don't want you to do that. Hello. Merry Christmas, Erin. Kelly, happy Pancha Ganapati. Ew, what is that? The five day hindu celebration in December, honoring the God Ganesh, patron of the arts. Cool. - Hey, man. - Hey, oh! How you holding up? Because of your wife leaving you. Kevin. I actually appreciate the human intimacy. I feel like a kitten being cradled by a gorilla. Yeah. It's been ten days since I had sexual intercourse. Well, you came to the right place. Ah. It-- This party will cheer you right up. I hope so. The corporate party was wretched. I am so tired of the Black-Eyed Peas. It's rock and roll for people who don't like rock and roll. It's rap for people who don't like rap. It's pop for people who don't like pop. Ah, heartbreaking. Oh, thank you. Well, I hate to have to take my Santa hat off and put on my hard ass hat, butThis is serious. It's come to my attention that somebody who shall remain nameless wants to switch desk clumps. Fine with me. Jim can leave any time he wants. - Good-bye. - Wasn't me. It wasn't either of you. Kathy wants to leave our clump? Don't look. Who it was is not important. But she did say that your constant pranking and one-upsmanship is driving her crazy. She or he. I just want to say this is not my fault. Okay, the weak always bully the strong, contrary to what you see in the media. I am always acting in self-defense. Occasionally preemptive self-defense. - Ow, what are you doing? - Hey! Hey! Respect the hat. Pam never seemed to have a problem with us. All right. I'm gonna speak in a language you both understand, Monet. - What? - What is? Money. You both have sizable Christmas bonuses coming your way. If I catch either of you messing with the other, I will give both bonuses to the other person. - Can't do that. - No, absolutely not. You need consequences. Okay, I want you both walking on eggshells. Hi, I'm Jessica. I'm looking for Andy. Jessica, yes. We don't say hi. We hug. I'm Erin. - I-- Oof. - Sorry. I hope you feel really welcome. - We all want you here. - Oh. My ex is meeting my sex. Which is always scary. You know? And not just because you think they might talk about your penis. That's just part of it. Hey! Jess, Erin. I hope you're not talking about my penis. - Hi. - Hi. Hey, everyone, I want you to meet Jessica. She is an assistant cross country coach at Bryn Mawr. Wow. Erin, by the way, amazing receptionist. Oh, that's great. Backbone of the office. Which is funny, actually, because my spine is a mess. - What? - Oh. Scoliosis. Had to wear a back brace for three years, but I never did. Oh, no. Oh, no, it's kicking in. - SpontaneousScoliosis. - Spontaneous scoliosis. Oh. This thing could take your arm off, your head off. You know, just exercise caution. - Thank you. - All right. All right. Oh, yeah, and, um There's a Christmas party upstairs tonight I wanted to tell you about. Isn't that just for popsicles? Popsicles? Yeah, like, upstairs people. 'Cause you got a stick up your butt. See, I thought it was because they're all so rich they could eat popsicles all the time. What? I-- In my-- Well, you should definitely come. The foreman always comes. Plus it's fun, you know, cookies, smoked fish, alcohol, people acting stupid. You had me at "clookies." I can't wait to find out what they are. What should I wear? Oh, it's nice. It's real nice. People get dressed up. I will look so handsome for you, Darryl. Ah I'm gonna s-- Dwight really wants my bonus. He's trying to entrap me. Oh, God, now I can't drink at this thing. I get really pranky when I drink. Erin, what can I get for you? Uh, do you have cola? Kirkland, if you have it. Why would you come to a bar and ask for a cola when you can get some from the kitchen? Did some small part of you want something a little stronger? Ryan, Kevin, Phyllis, Oscar, come and take these shots. - Oh. - Yes. Will do. The fifth one is for you, Erin. You can take it or leave it. To take it would be to accept that you're at a party and you're an adult woman with an adventurous spirit. To leave it would be fine, too. - One, two, three. - Yes. - Mm. - Whoa. - Hey, hey, nice. - Whoo! Jiminy Christmas! Jiminy Christmas, indeed. - Hit 'er up. - Oh, yes. - Whoo! - Yeah. Yeah, I just got my replacement credit card. Do you want the number-- Oh, it's 4-7-9-3 The security code is 927. Okay, great, thank you very much. Bye. So Dwight did take the bait. He used my credit card numbers to send a $200 bouquet of flowers To my wife. From me. Boom! Look, it's Christmas, so you're allowed-- Whoa, hello.   I meant dressed up compared to normal. You usually dress like a ghostbuster. Okay. I thought you'd wear a sweater. Since when does a sweater mean "dressed up"? Am I your grandson? Come on, stay, all right? It's good for people to get to know you. As a contestant on dancing with the stars, maybe. I want my sugar-free cookie, and then I want a sugar cookie. And then I want my nap. That's right. Thank you. She is remarkable. - Edgy impressions. - Thank you. How many drinks have you had tonight? I can't be driving everybody home. - A thousand. - Whoa! Maybe you should take a break. Maybe you should mind your own business. Just kidding. Ah, I've been attacked! Oh, my God. Oh, someone put a porcupine in my drawer. Oh, my God. Yeah, I was just sitting here at my desk, and I reached into my drawer to grab my toothbrush and some tooth powder, and-- and all of a sudden, I was attacked by this bloodthirsty rabid creature. I wonder, in this office, who has access to a porcupine? Or who in this office knows that I have access and is trying to set me up? Hm, you know, this sounds a lot like the premise of my latest Chad Flenderman novel, a murder for framing. Chad Flenderman. Just an easy-going black guy who knows the streets, yet he also went to Oxford. So just as comfortable on a motorcycle as he is on Air Force One. Oh, and he's also the world's leading egyptologist. Toby, nobody cares about your sex-crazed black detective. No, no, no, no, no, women chase him. H-he misses his wife. Hello, lacerated hand here, folks. Nice try. This is ridiculous. Oh, is it really? Two separate times you have set me up to believe that I was being recruited by the CIA. - Three times, actually. - You see? Jim, this has your fingerprints all over it. Andy, you've got to be kidding me. Fingerprints can be planted. You know, with a severed hand-- Do you think that's what happened? Do you think he used a severed hand? Okay, you know what, why don't we just call Animal Control? You might want to run that by Angela. 'Cause it's so cute. No. Porcupines don't have souls. They're like dogs. Yes, I'm calling from Dunder Mifflin. We have a very rabid porcupine in our office. Someone should come pick it up. Come down right away. Uh, I don't know, let me ask. Uh, were you quilled? Yes, I was quilled. - And what's its name? - Henrietta. - Oops. - What? All right. Get her out of here, Dwight.   Guys, I just wanted to say-- Come here. I am so happy you guys are together. Okay? And you both have such beautiful hair. Thank you. I hope you guys get married. And who knows? Maybe at the wedding I meet someone. Okay. And later on tonight, I hope I see you guys kiss. Yay. Okay, well, I'm gonna go do another reverse spit. That's how the cool kids say "get a drink." That's, uh, that's the girl you dated. Um, yeah, she's not really like that. It's No, she-- she seems fun. - Yeah, uh, excuse me. - Okay. - Hey. - Hey. Have you had anything to eat besides candy canes? - Every Martini has an olive. - Okay. Maybe I should make you some oatmeal or something. I don't want to put you out, but if someone's making oatmeal, I'll take an apple cinnamon and a maple brown sugar in one bowl with whole milk. Hey, I never told you my Christmas wish. - Okay. - It's about you. That's not what it should be. It should just be like a trinket or something. I'd said I wish Jessica was dead. You-- you mean you wish she wasn't here or something. I wish she was in a graveyard under the ground with worms coming out of her mouth. Hey, you know, you can't say that, okay? That's my girlfriend that you're talking about. You and I are not together anymore. You need to get over it. Take your wish back. Too late. It's already been wished. And you promised it would come true. You wrote it in an email! So which one are you, a murderer or a liar?   - Hey - Hey. So there was talk of oatmeal. You know? Don't listen to what anyone is saying. You look like a A princess. - Yeah. - Thanks. I was too embarrassed. Hey, guys, sorry to interrupt. I, uh, just found this on my desk and need to talk to somebody about it. Can you believe that? - Is that Cece? - Yes, it is. - Oh, man. - That's awful. - Cece is Jim's daughter. - Oh, my God. How could somebody do that? I know. I mean, the way I see it is, you can deface any picture of me. Any one. Pick one. Not my kid, though. Who did this? Who did this? - Do you know who did this? - I don't I know who did this. Dwight. - Dwight? - Yeah, he did. - What? No. - He should pay. He is gonna pay. This is fire-able. - Okay. - It's-- I mean-- Let me just see it one more time. You know what? I know who my friends are now. But I shouldn't have got you involved. Because the truth is, I don't even really care about this picture. It's a little out of focus. It was probably an accident, right? Like That's no accident. Right. You're right. So maybe it was me who did it. By accident. - What? - I'll figure it out. Get to the bottom of it. Merry merry. Enough of this garbage. This is Christmas.   Hiya!   Christmas! You all right, Santa? You know those movies where two friends are sleeping together and it's like, hey, can they stay friends? Yes. Do you think two friends who are not sleeping together can stay friends? Two friends who are not sleeping together? Can they remain friends? Yes, yeah. No. I-- Mm, I don't know. - Okay. - By the way, I'm not gonna mess with your and Dwight's bonuses. I think it's causing more problems. So just be yourselves, have fun, and try not to let it affect your work. All right. I will definitely do that. All right. I'll tell Dwight. You know what? You're sitting and thinking. And it's probably better if it comes from me anyway. Christmas miracles do happen. Yes, they totally do. You can't click on these Kardashian links. That's why you have so many viruses. Well, help me, okay? I'm trying, but-- - You need to-- - Kelly. - Yo. - Game on. On it. I don't know what I was thinking, it was awful. Jessica, did you just fart? And that is how it's done. I would like another alcohol. Let's you and I take a walk. Oscar, you're in charge of the bar. What? I haven't bartended in forever. Oh, never considered myself a mixologist. Oh, this is daunting. Uh, I need a mortar, pestle, muddler. Does anyone have any chocolate shavings? Your heart is broken. So's mine. And? And what? And do you have any advice or anything Oh, my God. To help me feel better? I've been married thrice, and each has ended in an acrimonious divorce. I'm not sure I'm the best person to give love advice. Oh. I was hoping you were going to make me feel better. - When you do your make-up - Uh-huh? How long does it take usually? 'Cause Um, it-- it depends. Chad Flenderman's kryptonite-- Whoa, we got a real Clarence Thomas here. - I'll see you at home. - Okay, great. - Perfect. - Bye. I still don't get why you can't just call her a cab and pay for it. I would, it just-- That wasn't the holiday wish. Either he drives or I drive, and now I'm drunk and mad. - Okay, bye. - Okay, bye. All right, come on, Meredith. Bye. Thank you, Santa. You bet. Thank God Erin's getting a ride home with Robert, 'cause she is trashed. And who better to drive her home than Robert? I mean, what a standup guy, you know? I mean, he's going through a lot-- Separating from his wife, showing up at the Christmas party in a track suit and a blazer. - Let's go, let's go. - I'm coming, I'm coming. - I'm coming, I'm coming. - Hang on. All right. - Whoa! My stuff! - What? What is all that? - It's my valuables! - It's junk. This is my treasures-- No, they're my treasures! You're a hoarder. My God! No, I'm not! I'm gonna sell it on eBay! No, no, no, you be careful. - Be careful! - Ah! My Santa suit's stuck. What are we gonna do with all that bonus money, Henrietta, huh? Where are we? This ain't my street. Shh, shh, shh, shh. Mmm, this is the posh part of town, huh? Oh, my God. Wonder what a studio condo would cost in this neighborhood. Meredith, shut your drunk hole right now. Erin, it was great fun tonight. Take a few aspirin, drink a whole lot of water, sleep in in the morning. Thank you. Good night. What are you smiling for? You thinking what I'm thinking? I'm sure I am not. Let's get you home. Ow! Take it easy! Whoo. Oh, man! Ah, fell asleep. Took a nap. Hey, guys. I feel refreshed now. - How's it going? - Dwight. Took a little nap right next to Jim's desk. I feel so good right now. Mmm, cookies. What's everyone staring at? Oh, man! I was supposed to tell Dwight something. Come on, Jim I got nothing. Today is the test launch day for the inaugural Sabre store. And I, Dwight Truth I'm in charge of the entire operation. If I can prove myself today and the store is a hit with the media and Nellie sees this, the vice presidency is mine. Hey are you holding this chair? 'Cause I feel like - Yes. Yes. Yes. - I'm gonna fall off. I'm not wearing the right shoes for this. We went over this, okay? Your tiny fingers make the best knots. Hey, strangers. So stoked for the Sabre store opening. Hey, my name's Tabitha. I'm camped out in front of the Sabre store so I can be first in line for the new pyramid. Psst. It's me, Erin. Dwight had me pretend to be a hipster to create hype, and it's working. There's already people camped out behind me. Test launch day, people. Now, I would like to fill you in on a little secret about me to inspire you today. Now, I know you probably all think I'm this patrician goddess. But here's the truth. I was born in the little working class town of Basildon, and until the age of 32, I talked like this, which was bloody horrendous, innit? I came from dirt-- No, lower than What's lower than dirt? Loam, magma, mantle, outer core, inner core. - Yeah, thank you. - Loam. Bloody loam, I came from. I hit rock bottom. When I auditioned for the Spice Girls, I didn't even get a callback. I never stood a chance. Okay. Now, think about my journey here today, and let it inspire your journey. Okay. Nellie, thank you. - Thank you so much. - Yep. Today is press day, and press is gonna make or break this store. And for a tech company, press can only mean one thing-- Bloggers. Dossier on bloggers. Bloggers are gross, bloggers are obese. Bloggers have halitosis. You're gonna love 'em. Ryan is going to be the main event today. He is the pitchman who is going to give the feisty, yet profound speech worthy of a world's fair. Ryan, you ready to do this? When people see this presentation, they're gonna in their pants. - Okay. - Come on, man. Seriously disgusting. Cathy, you will be the hot girl who talks to bloggers. Ugh. Kill me. That was my idea. Packer, you will be the sexual predator who has come to prey on the trendy teenage girls who are obsessed with the pyramid. - Uh - Uh That is excellent. I don't see what that gets us, but I'm a team player. Perfect casting, right? Schrute's out to get me. But I'm playing the long game. As soon as he messes up, I swoop in like a sexual predator. I want to create a sense of wonder and enthusiasm as if, at the end of ET, candy poured out of the screen. Do you understand? I wanna get goose pimples. Speaking of pimples, let's release the bloggers! Morning, everyone. Oh, Andy, guess what happened to me this morning? Don't care. Tell me later. Listen, it's important. You've gotta hear this. What do you got? - Oh, my God. - Do you have a black eye? Yes, I do, Phyllis. I woke up at 4:00 A.M. by accident, in time for the paper to be delivered. Guess what. It's not a kid on a bike. It's a man in a car. Andy, who punched you? Hey, I was on the can. What's this about a black guy in the office? Black eye, Meredith. Will someone please explain what's going on here? Since the interesting thing happened till now, so much time has passed, it's like my life is buffering. Here's what happened. Pam and I were arriving for the day, and there was a gang in the parking lot on bikes, on-- on motorcycles. And they just were hassling Pam - That's true. - They had, uh - Weapons. - Weapons. I just stepped in to talk some sense into them. But these were not the kind of people who use their words. Punches were going, and I ducked a few, landed a couple, and I was fighting them off. It was totally, like-- like, senseless crime. - Thank goodness he was there. - Good job, Andy. Yeah! I didn't do anything any of you wouldn't have done. Open the gates! There's plenty for everyone. No need to panic. - There's plenty for everyone! - Quit it! There's plenty! Don't stampede. No need to stampede, sir. - I was ahead of you! - Okay, okay, hey, hey! It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be fine. There's plenty of pyramids. Come on. I was in line before you. So you're a blogger, right? Yeah. Blogger. God, stay away. Oh, I always get in trouble around bloggers. I'm trying to be a good girl for once. Uh, yeah, I already bought my pyramid, but I don't want to leave yet. I haven't had so much fun since seeing Zoo-ey Desh-channel at the Couch-arilla Music Festival. So fun. How can we feel safe knowing that there are gangs here? We should call the police right now! - No! - Yes! No, no, no, no, no, we don't need to call the police. They'll just ask everybody questions, get up in everyone's business, right, Pam? Police are a hassle. We settled this on the street. And my eye will heal. But if the police come, then we will forever stain our neighborhood as a troubled area. Why would you care what the police think of our neighborhood? Because I have neighborhood pride. - 1-8-5-0-5. - Guys, guys. That's so vague. You gotta do the zip plus 4. Dash 7-4-2-7! Look, I don't feel safe. I think we should call the police. Exactly. We need to feel safe. Which is why Toby is teaching us self-defense. Me? Toby, will you teach us self-defense? Yeah. Um I can't believe you remembered I do self-defense. Um, I'll go put on my cup. Great. - Yes! - Okay. I wasn't sure which one of you was Chuck! Yeah, no, it seems to be going great. Andy got beat up by a fifth grade girl? Look at that guy. He's got his Sabre phone on, and he's not even using it. This is a perfect photo for my "Daily Fail" blog. Uh, I-I gotta go. Okay. Dwight, what is a fail? That sounds bad. Oh, no, no, no. It's good. It's really-- on the Internet, it's a really-- That's a really good, good thing. Are you trying to sabotage this entire event? I'm very sorry. We gave you an Arrowhead for free for the day. How hard would it have been to do this, hmm? "Hello. Hi, sweetie. It's Jim. "I'm calling you from the new Arrowhead, "which is why my voice is crystal clear "and my hand won't ever get tired because of the ergonomic shape." I'm really sorry. Is there anything I can do, maybe pretend to be Chuck? You could have pretended to be Chuck. I begged you to pretend to be Chuck, but you chose to be yourself, and you can no longer be Chuck! Surrender the tripack. You know what you have to do. Point it towards the store, idiot! You know what I mean? One of these buttons is-- Damn it. Take over. Oh, hey, hey, hey, you guys, you must be lost. Listen. Excuse me, sir. Yeah, the fountain where you can feed the pigeons is out behind the bank. Tell your great grandson to bring his kid by. Okay. So long. Here we go. Erin! Psst! Come on! The elderly suck the life out of the young. Get them out of here! We are closed! Come on. Self-defense is not some fun boxing match, okay? This is about escaping with your life. So Strike, scream, and run. All right? Let's try it. Ow. That may have been my fault. What the hell, Toby? Okay, look, in a real crisis situation, you're not gonna have time to think, okay? So just remember, I-a-a-t-g. "It's all about the groin." What if you're being attacked by a Smallish man who happens to not have a groin? I don't think that's very common. What if you're being attacked by a 4'11" man - who's penisless? - Why are you fixated on this hypothetical transgendered attacker? Why don't we start with the basics? Show us how to defend ourselves against a baby, and then like a fifth-grade girl, and then, you know, if we have time, on up to a scary man. Well, the most common scenario is a larger man attacking a smaller female. So in that scenario, what if the victim sucker-punches the attacker in the face? What can the attacker then do to better protect himself? It's interesting that you're drawn to the point of view of the attacker. You would like the turn of the table. Okay, the latest Chad Flenderman novel Based from the point of view of his nemesis, Dr. Lucifer Wu. Can I please leave? I have a rape flute. All right, well, let's try one simple technique together. Why doesn't everyone stand? Okay, so You're being attacked. You got your hands up. Simple palm strike to the chin. Up to the chin. One, two. One, two. - One, two. - Take that, kid. Cathy, I would like to introduce you to fatty gruesome. He is a freelancer for Wired Magazine. Patty Grossman. I'm a woman. But you still work for Wired, right? Yes. Good! Okay. Flirt away. Sabre. It's time to come home. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think It seemed like you were a little nervous. - Yeah, no , Sherlock! - Can somebody please tell me something encouraging about this presentation before I go out there in front of a million people and do it? I know, I know, champ, just calm down, because listen When you're out in front of all those people - Yeah, what? - You just need to realize so much rides on this. - You have no idea. - Dwight. I'm trying to make him feel important. God. I wish Kelly were here. She always knew what to say. Um Oh, Ryan, you're so smart. You're smarter than Mark Zuckerberg and those Google guys all combined. - Hee hee hee. - You're so ignorant, you barely know what you're talking about. That's so ridiculous. You really need to read a couple of books. What's a book? Oh, my God. You're so embarrassing. My mom would say the best stuff, though. You can You can do it, Ryan. And you know that I'm capable of this. - You're the only one who can do it, s-sweetie. What did you think of the presentation? I thought it was great, sweetie. I would just fix that one-- Oh, "fix" means you hate it! I knew it! - I need something to drink! - Jim, get him a water. No, not a water. A sports drink. I hate everything in that fridge. Not red-- Get me something yellow or green from a nearby store. Not red! Why are you just standing there? Go to a nearby store and get him a yellow or green sports drink! Now, if your attacker is willing to defile a corpse, you better stop playing dead right away and just make it known that you're alive. Forgive me for interrupting. I believe my daughter had an altercation with somebody here, some fancy gentleman with a squeaky voice? I think you guys might have the wrong office. That's him The guy I hit. - What? - You've gotta be kidding me. Poor Andy! First you got beat up by a gang, - and now she kicks your ass? - No, Kevin-- What about the lady you hit with a pine cone? There. That chubby one. I just had a baby. - Yesterday? - Wow. Apologize. Sorry I kicked your ass in front of your "thin" girlfriend. How 'bout we wait till next year after you have your kid? You know what? Tiffy's going to college. Listen, I don't know what you guys are talking about, but I guess I'll just accept your apology so we can get on with our day. God bless. Friend of mine uses your paper. You do good work. - Bye-bye. - Bye. So, Toby, I think we should do a different self-defense seminar-- "How to protect ourselves against tiny little girls." There's no shame in getting beaten up by a girl. My ex-wife used to demolish me. No, there is shame in it, okay? We have to draw the line somewhere. Oh, my God, I think I see the imprint of a ring pop. Oh Have you seen Erin? I'm on break. Oh, God! No, hey, bloggers, where do you think you're going? No, no, no, you gotta stay for the big presentation. We got this young whiz kid-- Ryan. He's like an even more handsome Bill Gates. When's the presentation? It's moments away. Just stay here! Hey, Uncle Lucas, it's your nephew, Ryan. Honestly, I could use a prescription for ritalin right now. Well, I know you did one for Aunt Carol. Oh, so it's different because it's your wife? Well, that doesn't make any sense to me. - How you doing? - Don't talk to me right now. I'm sorry, I know you're my boss, but seriously, you need to get the hell out of my face. What I don't understand is why Your little man is unraveling. Now, go and fix it. Sorry about kicking you out. It's just we don't want our brand associated with death. It's okay. I'll go to the Costco and search for handsome men. You're not married yet? Oh, I was. My husband was my best friend. He passed away. My best friend was my boss Andy. We dated for a while, but since then, he rejected me, and we're not really friends. Someone rejected you? With that body and those bazongas? Forget him! Yeah! Forget him! And you should forget your husband. Well How long has he been in the bathroom? - About ten minutes. - Jeez! What's he doing in there? Oop, that's my phone. Am I allowed to answer it, - or are you gonna freak out? - Are there bloggers around? It's Ryan. "I'm sorry. I lied. "I'm not in the bathroom. I can't do it. I need to see my mom. I'm going home." What is the delay here? Where's Ryan? Why is he not here? I had to send him home. As brilliant and creative as he is, he is nothing - Compared to this guy! - Uh - What? - That's right. Will you just give us a second? You are gonna bloody ruin it. You're gonna bloody ruin it because you're a no-good - half-ass cockeyed - Okay. - That's-- - Jim-- - I'm not doing the presentation. Look at me. Look at me! Look At This Face. This is not the face of a performer. This is the face of a scary apparition you see before you die. I'm telling you If you don't do this, I don't stand a chance. Please, Jim. Okay. I'll do it. Oh, my God. Okay! Go get into Ryan's costume and check out his notes. - A costume? - Of course there's a costume! Oh, this is gonna be great. There's nothing like some last-minute changes to really energize a presentation. Huh? Did you pass out in there? What is taking so long? I've been in here for 20 seconds. Hurry up. Let me in. I wanna watch you get dressed. Did you find the eyeliner? I'm not wearing eyeliner. You are wearing eyeliner, Jim. Time. Space. Gender. There are no rules anymore. All boundaries are breaking down in the wake of the infinite future. The only thing that-- The only thing that remain-- The only thing that remains are the things that have stood the test of time-- Love, values, and of course, the pyramids-- The strongest shape ever constructed, a shape that fits all other shapes inside of it. No, that-- It's true. This is the future, because this is the past. I've been through a lot of issues in my life. I've seen drug addiction, unemployment. I've been in a relationship that tore my heart apart without ever being able to accept that love drove the pain. Yep. When I was ten years old, my parents took me to Disney World. I cried the whole time. I was not able to comprehend the beauty that was before me. I just wanted To go home. This is what the pyramid will do for you. It is the bridge to the world. It has a USB port. Wireless Will be available in 2013. You can play anything from Chuck to Cars 2. With the pyramid, you have the connection to everything, in time and space. Oh! Psst! Oh. Sabre. It's time to come home. All right. Thank you so much. Wow. Wow! And good night. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you very much. Okay, this isn't over. Let's stay focused, okay? We made fun of Andy earlier for getting beat up by a little girl, but little things can be dangerous. Whether it's a Gremlin or Chucky The Doll-- The key is to throw it in something. Like a fireplace or a tub of electricity. Okay, good point. Um Good point? What is a tub of electricity? - I don't-- I don't-- - With all due respect, we know what we're defending against. It's a 12-year-old female bully. - I was a 12-year-old bully. - Great! I think Kelly should attack Toby. Yeah. Yeah, that's not a bad idea, actually, because I have had a lot of pent-up aggression. - Thanks. - Good. Go. - I don't know if this is gonna help-- Let's go, Kelly. We should stay to maybe some more traditional models-- You think you're so pretty! Well, you're not gonna be so pretty come prom time! Okay, this is what's called pre-violent posturing. Take that! Not so pre-violent anymore! Okay, I'm at what's called "the decision point." - Hey, hey, hey, Kelly, Kelly, Kelly-- Ow! God! My good eye! Oh, boy! Oh, no, I'm not laughing at you. I'm laughing at, um something that Cece did on the playground earlier-- Yesterday. This morning. You know why I got hit by girls? Because I stood up for others Pam and Toby. I stepped in, and I didn't care that I was standing up to girls. You may wanna ask yourselves, "where were you when the girls came?" Tough day. Yes. But I feel good. I put the office in their place, took a bunch of pain killers, drank half a bottle of wine, took my pants off. I just feel good! Okay, okay, I will be the first to admit it. We could have integrated more Chuck into the presentation. Dwight. You're the Vice President. Ha ha ha ha! Yeah! Okay! - Come on! - Aah! Right on! Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam! Boom!
