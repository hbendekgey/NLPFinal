MICHAEL: Tonight is the Dundies, the annual employee awards night here at Dunder Mifflin. And this is everybody's favorite day. Everybody looks forward to it, because, you know, a lot of the people here don't get trophies very often, like Meredith or Kevin. I mean, who's gonna give Kevin an award? Dunkin' Donuts? Plus, bonus, it's really, really funny. So I You know, an employee will go home and he'll tell his neighbor, "Hey, did you get an award?" And the neighbor will say, "No, man. I mean, I slave all day. "Nobody notices me." The next thing you know, the employee smells something terrible coming from the neighbor's house. The neighbor's hanged himself due to lack of recognition. So, you ready for the Dundies? (SIGHS) PAM: You know what they say about a car wreck, where it's so awful you can't look away? The Dundies are like a car wreck that you wanna look away, but you have to stare at it because your boss is making you. (HOARSELY) Hey, hey, hey! It's Fat Halpert. What? Fat Halpert. Jim Halpert. So, why don't I take you on a tour of past Dundie winners? We got Fat Jim Halpert here. Jim, why don't you show off your Dundies to the camera? Oh, I can't, because I keep them hidden. I don't wanna look at them and get cocky. Oh, that's a good idea. And mine are at home in a display case above my bed. Yuck! TMI. TMI, my friends. TMI? Too Much Information. It's just easier to say TMI. I used to say, "Don't go there," but that's lame. And here we have Stanley the Manly. Now, Stanley is a Dundie All-Star. Aren't you, Stan? Why don't you show them some of your bling? I don't know where they are. I think I threw them out. No, you didn't. I think I did. Why did Say, we gotta order some more appeteasers this time. We ran out last year, remember? Yes, we should. You know what? I wanted one of those skillets of cheese, but when I got off-stage someone had eaten all of them. To Oscar Martinez, it's the Show Me The Money Award. Michael has taped every Dundies Awards, and now he's making me look through hours of footage to find highlights. song that I think we're gonna play for the ladies. Hit it, Dwight. (PLAYING FLUTE) A little bit of Pam all night long A little bit of Angela on the thing A little bit of Meredith everywhere This is the part where Kevin sat in front of the camcorder all night. It's great. A little bit of Roy eating chicken crispers A little bit of Kim with some ribs A little bit of It was you. Live and learn. It wasn't, I swear. Yeah, it was. So, what's the joke? You're not perfect, either. We're not laughing at you, Dwight. So, who are we laughing at? Just something somebody wrote. Who, Dave Barry? No, no. Just something that was written on the ladies' room wall. What is it? Who wrote it? It's kind of private. It's about Michael. (LAUGHING) That is defacement of company property, so you better tell me. Kelly, if you tell me, you'll be punished less. Okay, now I'm laughing at you. (PAM LAUGHING) Will Her Highness Jan Levinson-Gould be descending from her corporate throne this evening to visit us lowly serfs here at Dunder Mifflin, Scranton? JAN: (STUTTERING) It's a two-and-a-half-hour drive from New York, Michael. Well, you could take the bus, you could work on the way here, sleep on the way home? No. Come on, Jan, this is important. I mean, this is validation to my employees here that you and corporate approve of this. So But we don't approve of this, Michael. You only have the budget for one office party a year, so we're not paying for this. Um Could you Are you there? Yeah, I'm here. I just wanted to talk to you for a second about that. MICHAEL: What What is I mean, come on, Jan. What, it's a You're dropping an A-bomb on me here. Really? I'm dropping an atomic bomb on you? Well, yeah! I mean what is What No, you can't You already had a party on May 5th for no reason. No reason? It was the 05-05-05 party. And you also had a luau. It happens once every billion years. And you had a luau. And the Tsunami Relief fundraiser, which somehow lost a lot of money. Okay, no, that was a fun-raiser. I don't really understand that. I think I made that very clear in the flyers. Okay, well, I don't understand why anyone would have Fun. F-U-N. a Tsunami fun-raiser, Michael. Well, I think a lot of people I mean, that just doesn't make sense. were very affected by the footage. This is a little character I like to do. It is loosely based on Karnak, one of Carson's classic characters. Here we go. The PLO, the IRA, and the hotdog stand behind the warehouse. (RIPPING) Name three businesses that have better healthcare plans than Dunder Mifflin. Here's the problem. There's no open bar because of Jan. And it's the reason why comedy clubs have a two-drink minimum. We'll be fine, but I just wish people were gonna be drunk. PHYLLIS: Dwight, get out of here! No, no, no What are you doing in the ladies' room? It's not what you think. No! Why were you in there? What were you doing in there? You are a pervert! I am not. The Dundie Award for Longest Engagement goes to Pam Beesly. Pam, everybody! (MICHAEL WHOOPING) When is that girl gonna get married? That's what I have to say. Ah, Roy's accepting. Yes. MICHAEL: Thank you, Roy. Are there any words you'd like to say on Pam's behalf? ROY: We'll see you next year. MICHAEL: Yeah! (MICHAEL LAUGHING) Hope not. Hope not. I'm not changing that. That's the best one. No, it's hilarious. You're right. I just think, "World's Longest Engagement," we're all expecting it, you know? That's why it's funny. Every year that Roy and Pam don't get married, it gets funnier. Well, I'd think if you use the same jokes, it just comes across as lazy. Oh, "lazy." Uh-huh. Excuse me, everyone. Can I have your attention, please? I just wanted to say that the women in this office are terrible. Especially the ones who wrote that stuff about Michael on the bathroom wall. Having a bathroom is a privilege. It is called a ladies' room for a reason, and if you cannot behave like ladies, well, then you are not going to have a bathroom. You're taking away our bathroom? We are going to have two men's rooms. But where would we go? Be prepared to hold it, folks. From 9:00 a. M Okay, okay, look PAM: Michael? Yes? Dwight's banning us from our bathroom. Okay, well, that's ridiculous. So, just don't I don't have time for this right now. There needs to be repercussions for people's behavior. Just don't talk, don't talk Okay, look, I know there have been a lot of rumors flying around about the Dundies this year. How there is no money, and how there is no food, and how the jokes are really bad. But, what the hell, everybody? I mean, God! The Dundies are about the best in every one of us. Can't you see that? I mean Okay, we can do better. So tonight, for the first time, we are inviting all of your friends and family to attend the awards with us. Yes! MICHAEL: Yeah. Not bad, right? So let's make this the best Dundies ever. (CLAPPING) Best Dundies ever. (SIRENS WAILING) (TRUMPETING) Welcome to the Eighth Annual Dundies Awards. DWIGHT: Before we get started, a few announcements. Keep your acceptance speeches short. I have wrap-it-up music and I am not afraid to use it, Devon. (O.P. P PLAYING) (SINGING) The Dundies, how can I explain it? Or would you like to hate it? I'm happy that you all made it You never had to work so hard And feel no one notices You're just a name and number And no one even says hello Card! OSCAR: The Dundies are kind of like a kid's birthday party. And you go, and there's really nothing for you to do there, but the kid's having a really good time, so you You're kind of there. That's That's kind of what it's like. You down with the Dundies? You down with the Dundie The waitress tripped on the cord. All right, all right. Joke landed. So, we are here. Thank you all for coming to the 2005 Dundie Awards. I am your host, Michael Scott, and I just wanna tell you, please, please, do not drink and drive. Because you may hit a bump and spill the drink. I'll just put these on the group tab. No, actually, this year no group tab. We're gonna be doing separate checks. ROY: What? LONNY: Oh, great. Is he serious? You said we could bring our families. I did, and why didn't you, Stanley? I did. My wife's name is Teri. Well, I'm looking forward to meeting Teri. It's this person whose hand I'm holding, Michael. (BREATHING HARD) VOICE: Oh, yeah. Shut it. Good. Speaking of relationships, of all ways, shapes, and forms, I was out on a very, very hot date last night with a girl from HR, Dwight. Really? We don't have any girls from HR. No, that For the sake of this story. And things were getting hot and heavy. DWIGHT: Yeah? And I was about to take her bra off Yeah? when she had me fill out six hours' worth of paperwork. Like an AIDS test? No. God. (MICHAEL CLEARING THROAT) MICHAEL: All right. So, let's get this party started! Hey, let's go to Poor Richard's. Yeah, let's get out of here. Guys, where you going? Pam, the show's just getting started. Sorry. (CLEARING THROAT) MICHAEL: And now, to someone who goes Are you staying? Yeah. Gotta eat somewhere. MICHAEL: quietly about their job, but always seems to land the biggest accounts. The Busiest Beaver Award goes to Phyllis Lapin! MICHAEL: Yeah! Way to go, Phyllis. Nice work, per usual. This says, "Bushiest Beaver." What? I told them "Busiest." Idiots. It's fine. Well, we can fix it. We'll fix it up. You don't have to display that. Because that's what happens every time He's a jackass. Every year. No. Come on, I'm going to Poor Richard's. No, I don't wanna go. I don't want to. Pam. If you would have asked me that, then you would know. Hello, everybody. MICHAEL: You know, Michael called Hey. How are you? I thought you had left. No, I just I decided to stay. Oh. I'll just get a ride home from Angela. MICHAEL: I'm going to call Jan Levinson-Gould Oh, good. I'm just in time for Ping. Yeah. of Dunder Mifflin, and me so horny. Right? You know what I'm talking about. Can I get a drink? (MICHAEL EXCLAIMING) (YOU SEXY THING PLAYING) This next award goes to somebody who really lights up the office. Somebody who I think a lot of us cannot keep from checking out. The Hottest in the Office Award goes to Ryan, the temp! MICHAEL: Yeah! (ALL CLAPPING) You sexy thing Sexy thing, you Here you go. Hanging and a humming and a huh Come from baby? (WHOOPING) There you go. There you go. What am I gonna do with the award? Nothing. I don't know what I'm gonna do. That's the least of my concerns right now. And the Tight Ass Award goes to Angela. Not only because she is everybody's favorite stickler, but because she has a great caboose. So, come on down. No. (LAUGHING) (SLURPING) I think those might be empty. No, no, 'cause the ice melts, and then it's, like, second drink. Second drink? The Spicy Curry Award goes to our very own Kelly Kapoor! Get on up here! There you go. "Spicy Curry." What's that mean? Not everything means something. It's just a joke. Yeah, but why'd you give it to me? I don't know. I just This is a bowler. I know. It's They didn't have any more businessmen. Yeah, but everyone else Just sit down, Kelly. (SIGHING) It's so freaking hot in there. Now I know what Bob Hope was going through when he performed in Saudi Arabia. Man! MICHAEL: I got Dwight sucking the funny out of the room. But, you know, you do what you can do. (TINY DANCER PLAYING) Here we go. He's early with the cue. I've gotta go. You have won a tiny Dundie (HOWLING) Sing it, Elton! Hey, thanks, guys. Hey, where you guys from? We just came from your mama's house. Are you guys gonna finish that? MICHAEL: All right, yeah. MAN: Sing another song, dude. You know what, guys, we're just having a little office party. So, if you wanna Hey! You know, cool it, guys, really. MAN: You suck, man. You suck. Let's cut it. (CLEARS THROAT) I had a few more Dundies to give out tonight, but I'm just gonna cut it short and wrap it up, so everybody can enjoy their food. Thanks for listening, those of you who listened. (MICHAEL CLEARING THROAT) This last Dundie is for Kevin. This is the "Don't Go In There After Me" Award. It's for the time that I went to the bathroom after him and it was really, really smelly. There you go. Yay, Kevin! (PAM WHOOPING) For Kevin! For stinking up the bathroom! Yeah. All right, Kev! (WHOOPING) Hey, I haven't gotten one yet. MICHAEL: Yeah. Yes, I have not gotten one, either. JIM: So, keep going. More Dundies! Dundies! Dundies! Dundies! Dundies! Dundies! Dundies! ALL: Dundies! Dundies! Dundies! Dundies! Dundies! Dundies! All right, all right, all right, all right, okay. MICHAEL: All right. We'll keep them rolling. Okay, this is the Fine Work Award. This goes to Stanley for all the fine work he did this year. PAM: For the fine work. Fine work, Stanley! MICHAEL: You know you did. Hear, hear! Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech! Well, last year I got Great Work, (LAUGHING) So I don't know what to think about this award. But at least I didn't get Smelliest Bowel Movement like Kevin. And this next award is going out to our own little Pam Beesly. I think we all know what award Pam is gonna be getting this year. It is the Whitest Sneakers Award, because she always has the whitest tennis shoes on. Get on down here! Pam Beesley, ladies and gentlemen! Oh, here we go. I have so many people to thank for this award. Okay, first off, my Keds, because I couldn't have done it without them. PAM: Thank you. Let's give Michael a round of applause for emceeing tonight, because this is a lot harder than it looks. And also because of Dwight, too. So, finally, I want to thank God, because God gave me this Dundie and I feel God in this Chili's tonight. (WHOOPING) Pam Beesley, ladies and gentlemen! Thank you. Yeah! (SIGHING) (BOTH SIGHING) JIM: What a great year for the Dundies. We got to see Ping and we learned Michael's true feelings for Ryan, which was touching. And we heard Michael change the lyrics to a number of classic songs, which, for me, has ruined them for life. ((I'VE HAD) THE TIME OF MY LIFE PLAYING) What? Nothing. Okay. What? I don't know. What? Oh, my God! You are so drunk. Did you get that? Please tell me that you got This is all going to be on This woman is having a seizure. Grab her tongue! Grab her tongue! It's okay, I'm a Sheriff's Deputy. Well, he's a volunteer. Don't get into that now. DWIGHT: We need something to cushion her head. (SINGING PARODY) Throw pillow, a cushion Okay, I'm gonna use my shirt. PAM: Get off of me. DWIGHT: No! MAN: I'm sorry, sir, you're gonna have to put your clothes on. People are trying to eat. I can't. Was this year's Dundies a success? Well, let me see. I made Pam laugh so hard that she fell out of her chair and she almost broke her neck. So I killed, almost. Oh, my God! I just want to say that this was the best Dundies ever. (SCREAMING) Careful, careful, careful. We have a strict policy here not to over-serve. Apparently, this young woman was sneaking drinks off of other people's tables. I Xeroxed her driver's license, and she is not welcome at this restaurant chain ever again. Great work tonight. Watch your step. Excellent. Thanks. I had to check her pupils to make sure there wasn't a concussion. Yes, that, too. But, I mean, with the audio. Great work. I feel bad about what I wrote on the bathroom wall. No, you don't. Oh, here she is. Careful, careful, whoa. All right, easy. You're almost there. Hey, can I ask you a question? Shoot. I just wanted to say thanks. It's not really a question. Okay, let's get you home, drunk. All right. Bye. Good night. Have a good night. Thank you, Angela. (PHONE RINGING) (CLEARING THROAT) Hey, what's up? Hey. Any e-mails today? I don't think so. No? Check your spam folder. There it is. What? "Fifty signs your priest might be Michael Jackson." Well done. Kidding. Topical. MICHAEL: I am "King of Forwards." It's how I like to do business. Everybody joking around. We're like Friends. I am Chandler and Joey. And Pam is Rachel. And Dwight is Kramer. So, the monkey does the sex thing right here. That's funny. That's funny. Not offensive, because it's nature, educational. Do you want the link? 'Cause then you could forward it around. Consider it? Maybe, maybe. Well, we'll see. Because I don't know if MICHAEL: Come on. What has two thumbs and likes to bone your mom? This guy! MICHAEL: Oh, you are so bad. (BOTH EXCLAIMING) This guy is out of control. He is a madman. Better get the bleep button ready for him. Bleep-bleep. What's up, Halpert? Still queer? MICHAEL: Todd Packer and I are total "BFF." "Best Friends Forever." He and I came up together as salesmen. One time, we were out, and we met this set of twins, and Packer told them that we were brothers. And so, you know, one thing led to another, and we brought them back to the motel, and then Packer did both of them. It was awesome. Okay. Grade-A gossip for you. Right now. Randall, CFO, resigned. Nobody knows why. Are you kidding? Everyone knows why. You don't know? Okay, check this out, all right. What? So, here's the story. Yeah? So Randall is nailing his secretary, right? And she's totally incompetent. Really? Here we go. Buckle up! It's gonna be a bumpy one! We're talking blonde incompetent, right? Oh, yeah. Like, 10 words a minute? Talking? Well, to be fair, blondes, brunettes, you know, there are a lot of dumb people out there. Right. They are women, right? (EXCLAIMING) I didn't say it, I didn't say it! Come on, I said it. And then suddenly, for no reason, this bimbo blows the whistle on the whole thing just to be a bitch. What'd I tell you about the bleep button? Hey, what has two thumbs and hates Todd Packer? This guy. Meant to ask you, can you think you can get somebody to drive me around because of the DUI situation? Bad boy. Ryan? Come on, kid, let's go. Man, that Todd Packer can do anything. Except pass that Breathalyzer. You a big William Hung fan? Why does everybody ask me that? Who the hell is that? (EXCLAIMING) I'm really excited to meet your mom. You are? My mom is coming in to visit. She lives, like, two hours away, and she doesn't have a cell phone. Which is cool, 'cause it's kind of adding some suspense to my day, and I keep looking over at the door, hoping she'll walk in. I'm excited to show her around. She really wants to meet everybody. Oh, yeah? Good. 'Cause I have a lot of questions. Oh, really? Yeah. "As a child, did Pam show any traits "that would hint towards her future career as a receptionist?" Hey, send me that link to the monkey sex video. I'm going to forward it like it's hot. Yes! Forward it like it's hot, forward it like it's hot. Old school. Michael? Yes, Toby? I need to talk to you in your office, it'll just take two seconds. (CLEARING THROAT) Literally two seconds? Toby is in HR, which technically means he works for corporate. So he's really not a part of our family. Also, he's divorced, so he's really not a part of his family. The full story is that Randall resigned because of sexual harassment. So corporate asked me to do a five-minute review of the company's sexual harassment policy. No. No, Toby, no. It's really not a big deal. It is a big deal. It's a big deal. What are we supposed to do, scrutinize every little thing we say and do all day? I mean, come on. And then, corporate is gonna send in a lawyer What? No. Just to refresh you on our policy. What? He No. Okay, what is a lawyer gonna come in and tell us? To not send out hilarious e-mails? Or not tell jokes? Maybe not some of them, maybe not inappropriate ones. There is no such thing as an appropriate joke. That's why it's a joke. Everyone. Hello, everyone? Hi. Sorry to interrupt, I know you're all busy, and the last thing you want is for a major interruption. But Toby has an announcement that he insists on making right now in the middle of the day. So take it away. Yeah, okay. Corporate would like us to do a five-minute review of the company's sexual harassment policy, so I'll go over that later. MICHAEL: I wish you luck, Toby, I really do. But you are going to have a mutiny on your hands. And I just can't wait to see how you handle it. A guy goes to a $5 lady of the night and he gets crabs. So the next day, he goes back to complain. And the woman says, "Hey, it was only $5. "What did you expect, lobster?" This is what's at stake. (ELEVATOR BELL DINGING) Time to bring out the big guns. I'm heading down to the warehouse, where jokes are born. Find a killer joke that'll just blow everybody away at the seminar later. And remind them what is great about this place. So Here they are. Guys. Wondering if I could get your help for something? I am looking for a new joke to tell. And it needs to be just killer. And it does not need to be clean. So what you got? Like, a joke, a knock-knock joke? Yeah, no, well, I mean, better. Better than that. The type of stuff you guys tell all day. You know? Well Those are some awful tight pants you have on. Where'd you get them, like, "Queers R Us"? "Boys R Us." All right, all right, well, good, yeah, but you know, a joke, but not necessarily at my expense. So what've we got, like Man, we could see all your business coming around the corner, okay? You need to, you know, hide that. Good thing you don't have a lot of business to start with. Okay. But that was still about me, so Hey, hey. What? So you don't have the biggest package, don't feel bad. I don't feel bad. I think he feels bad. No, I don't. Well, you look like you feel bad Okay. 'Cause it's a little package. Well, you know not exactly A little package! what I was looking for, but thanks, guys. Thank you. You look good in those pants. He gets it from his mama. (ALL EXCLAIMING) So remember, intent is irrelevant. And that's it. Pam? I just wanted to say that, just, my mom's coming in today. MILF. Thanks, Kevin. Usually, the day we talk about sexual harassment is the day that everyone harasses me as a joke. She's coming in today, and maybe just don't joke around about that stuff in front of her. Great point. Thank you. In fact, basic rule of thumb, let's just act every day like Pam's mom is coming in. All right, that's it. If anybody has any questions about anything, you know where I sit in the back. It is over? TOBY: Yes. MICHAEL: No. I can go over it with you. I know, I know, it's good. It is not over. It is not over till it's over. TOBY: It's over. Did he tell you everything? Obviously, he didn't, because you all still look relatively happy. Albeit bored. Do you realize what we're losing? Seriously. E-mail forwards. Exactly. Can we afford to lose e-mail forwards? Do we want that? I hate them. You send me these filthy e-mails, and you say, "Forward them to 10 people or you'll have bad luck." Give me a break. Stanley? How about that hot picture you have by your desk? Centerfold in the Catholic schoolgirl's outfit? I mean, it is hot, it is sexy, and it turns him on. And I will admit, best part of my morning is staring at it. But what? Are we gonna just take it away? That is my daughter, she goes to Catholic girls' school. I'm taking it down right now. What about office romance? Office relationships are never a good idea. So let's just try to avoid them, but if you already have one, you should disclose it to HR. All relationships? Even a one-night stand? I think the old honor system was fine. For example, I have never slept with an employee, and believe me, I could have. Yeah, Meredith. No, no, Catherine! Remember her? Remember how hot she was? DWIGHT: Yes. She would have definitely slept with me. She wasn't that hot. Yes, she was. TOBY: Okay, you know, Michael Damn it, Kevin. I'm in an office relationship. It's special. She's nice, she's shy, she's actually here if you wanna meet her. Hold on a second. Oh, my God. Put on a shirt. Put on I told you that you'd be on camera. I'm sorry, she's European. No, I told you that you'd be on camera. Stop. What if Pam was a lesbian? What if she brought her "partner" in to work? Would that be crossing the line? TOBY: No. What if they made out in front of everybody? TOBY: Well, that would be MICHAEL: At home? And I told everybody everything about it? Okay, I'm lost. Okay. Well, then, let's act it out. Pam, you will be Girl A, and Girl B will be Okay, we'll use the doll. Pam? Pam. I wish Todd Packer was here, 'cause he would love this. I wonder if anybody else would like to join us? Hey! We have to watch Toby's video that he's showing us, in order to brainwash us, and I was wondering if anybody would like to join in? Gonna be fun. Got microwave pizza. What do you say? Jim? No thanks, I'm good. That's what she said. Pam? My mother's coming. That's what she said. No, but, okay, well, suit yourself. Hey, Toby. Hey, Dwight. You said that we could come to you if we had any questions. Sure. Where is the clitoris? On a website it said, "At the crest of the labia." What does that mean? What does the female vagina look like? Technically, I am in Human Resources, and Dwight was asking about human anatomy. I'm just sad the public school system failed him so badly. You know, maybe when you get really comfortable with each other, you can ask for that. Good. Good. And I should get back to work. Okay. In today's fast-paced business climate, it can sometimes be hard to know when a comment or an action crosses the line. Let's take a look at a couple of scenarios, and ask ourselves, "Where is the line?" "The Natural Redhead." MAN: Hey, Marie. Hey, Joe, Mike. Settle a bet. Are you a natural redhead? Stop the video! We go Stop it right there. What? That's that girl from that thing. I banged this girl right here. That's her? Yes, this is the one, you remember? No, the party? DARRYL: Yes! You banged her? Yes, right here. You are a naughty girl! MICHAEL: Whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait. Hypocrite! DARRYL: Leave those lips alone! Okay, she is a hypocrite. That is such a scam. Okay. Yes? Yes, I did. Okay, well, we can talk about that later, then. Okay, you are never gonna believe this. The girl in the video we're watching that corporate gave us, Darryl banged her And he's about 90% sure. (DOOR OPENING) Don't ever let this little bitch drive you around town, we got lost for half an hour. I don't have any DUIs, so I can drive myself, but thanks. Where is Michael "Snot"? Sniffing some dude's thong? Probably. So you are the lawyer, Mr. O'Malley. I know a lot of lawyer jokes. I love lawyer jokes. Well, it's probably because you don't get them. When I said before that I was "King of Forwards," you gotta understand, that I don't come up with this stuff. I just forward it along. You wouldn't arrest a guy who was just delivering drugs from one guy to another. You seem a little bit agitated, Michael. What's the problem? The problem is that I am the boss, and apparently I can't say anything. Well, that's true, in a way, you can't say anything. Where's the line? Where's the line, Jan? Do you need to see the video again, Michael? No, I've seen the video. He talked the whole time. No, I didn't. MICHAEL: What? Attention, everyone. Hello. Yes, I just want you to know that, this is not my decision, but from here on out, we can no longer be friends. And when we talk about things here, we must only discuss work-associated things. And you can consider this my retirement from comedy. And in the future, if I want to say something funny, or witty, or do an impression, I will no longer ever do any of those things. Does that include "that's what she said"? Yes. Wow, that is really hard. You really think you can go all day long? Well, you always left me satisfied and smiling, so That's what she said! Michael! MICHAEL: Come on! JAN: Michael, please. There he is. Please. PACKER: Come on. You would have done the same, you just didn't think of it first. Michael. Michael, please, I really It's That's It's not my sense of humor. Okay. Hello. Jan, Mr. O'Malley, this is my lawyer, James P. Albini. Your what? I believe you may recognize his face from the billboards. He specializes in free speech issues. And motorcycle head injuries, worker's comp, and diet pill lawsuits. This guy does it all. Excuse me, I'm sorry. Michael, Mr. O'Malley is your lawyer. What? Mr. O'Malley is our corporate lawyer. We have him on retainer to protect the company, as well as upper-level management such as yourself. So I'm not in trouble? I'm so used to being the "bad boy." I am so used to fighting corporate, that I forget that I am corporate. Upper management. They hooked me up with an attorney, to protect me. You can't be too careful about what you say. Mo' money, mo' problems. Okay, well, let's get you out of here, James. I think we're under an hour still, so. Yeah, but I did a lot of paperwork at home before I got here. I know. Well, we'll talk about it later. Thanks for coming in. Hello. Oh, my God. I finally made it. Hello. I love my mom. Okay, that's probably the most obvious statement ever. Okay. This is all yours? Yeah, I'm in charge of this whole area. Oh, my goodness, that's great. So a guy goes home, tells his wife, "Honey, pack your bags, I just won the lottery." She goes, "Oh, my God, that's incredible, where are we going?" He goes, "I don't know where you're going. Just be out of here by 5:00." (LAUGHING) PACKER: Boom! This is where I used to keep my computer. Oh, right, I remember, with the picture. But then I moved it. Yeah, yeah. But I switched stuff around, because I actually needed, like, more room for organization. Sure. So this is, like, an organization station. Oh, there he is! Hey! How are you? Hey, handsome. ROY: You look great. Oh, thank you. So, we ready for dinner? Well, you know, actually, I kind of need to stall a bit. But, it's okay, because I am very used to killing time. I don't believe that. Okay, I'm gonna go wait in the parking lot. And what kind of tunes you want for the ride? A little classical, little oldies? Anything is fine. All right, I'll see you. (DOOR CLOSING) So, which one is Jim? Mom. I just wanted to know. No, it's All right, okay. Okay. Ten minutes. Okay. Then we can go to dinner. I'll make myself busy. There's this guy, he's at a nymphomaniac convention. And he is psyched, 'cause all these women are smoking hot, perfect 10s, except for this one chick, who looks a lot like KEVIN: Phyllis? Yeah. No, no, no, that crosses the line. Ex-squeeze me? Not you. Kevin, just unwarranted, hostile work environment, Kevin. Well, Packer said it. No, you said it, he pointed. A point is not a say. Look, Kevin, we are a family here, and Phyllis is a valued member of that family, like a grandmother. I'm the same age as you, Michael. I don't know about that. We're the same high school class Well, I have a late birthday, and usually September is the cut-off point. You know what? You just crossed the line. Okay? There's a line, and you went over it. And you must be punished. So go to your corner. You mean, where my desk is? Yes, your corner, go. Okay. I have a lot of work to do, anyway. Oh, my. They really got to you, didn't they? They didn't get to me. I got to them. I am still the same old Michael Scott. New and improved. You know what? I love Phyllis. And know what else? I think she is gorgeous. I think she is an incredibly, incredibly attractive person. Come here, give me a kiss, come on. Michael, come on, you don't have to worry. I'm not gonna report you to HR. I'm not I'm not worried! You know what? The only thing I am worried about is getting a boner. Good work today, everybody. Times have changed a little. And even though we're still a family here at Dunder Mifflin, families grow. And at some point, the daddy can't take a bath with the kids anymore. I am upper management, and it would be inappropriate for me to take a bath with Pam. As much as I might want to. He said what?   MICHAEL: I'm an early bird and I'm a night owl. So I'm wise and I have worms. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) MICHAEL: Oh, breakfast. I got your sausage, egg and cheese biscuit. Yummy, yummy, thank you, Ryan. What was the thing you needed me to come in early for? Um The sausage, egg and cheese biscuit. But, thank you. And why don't you just take a couple hours. Office is yours. Home Alone, Risky Business. Take your pants off, run around. Whatever you want to do. I'm just going to take a nap in my car till work starts. Okay. See? Healthier, got to watch those carbs. Today, I, Michael Scott, am becoming a homeowner, investing in real estate. Diversifying. Smart. Yes, it is. Yes, it is. It is very important to own property. Back in olden days, they would not even let you vote unless you owned property, and they'd throw you in the stocks and humiliate you. And it worked. Yes. They should bring the stocks back, people would obey the law, there'd be less troublemakers. Maybe. PAM: Every so often, Jim dies of boredom. I think today it was the expense reports that did him in. And our deal is, that it's up to me to revive him. You see Dwight's coffee mug? Sometimes when he's not here, I try to throw stuff in it. No way. Let's do this. Here, try paperclips. Oh, wait, this message, for Dwight. Perfect. You should go. Yes, yes. Final walk-through. Sign the papers at the condo. You have your lawyer there? I don't need one. Can I be your representative? I think I should be there. I don't need representation. No, no. No, I'm good. I can make sure things are up to code. No, Dwight. Please. I'm always the guy that you rely on at work. Well, this isn't about work. This is closing on a condo. It's completely personal. So, you're taking a personal day? Except that it's about my living arrangement and as boss I need to have a living arrangement in order to do work. Please. I'll make you proud. Okay, fine. Yes, you can come. Yes. As your representative? As my associate. Same thing. No, it is not. I have been Michael's number two guy for about five years and we make a great team. Why, we're like one of those classic, famous teams. He's like Mozart and I'm like Mozart's friend. No, I'm like Butch Cassidy, and Michael is like Mozart. You try and hurt Mozart, you're gonna get a bullet in your head, courtesy of Butch Cassidy. (MICHAEL EXCLAIMS) Most honorable Pamela. Not offensive, because that's the way they talk in movies. You headed out? We are. Dwight and I are going to the big thing. So, why don't you have everybody work on their expense reports and I'd like them in by the end of the day. Okay. Very good. Have a great time. We will. Did you do the thing I asked you to do about the magazines? Yeah, I changed them to your new address. Good. The Small Business Man? Yep. Maxim? American Way? CRACKED? Yes, I changed your CRACKED magazine subscription. How about Fine Arts Aficionado Monthly? No? Okay. Well, could you get on that, 'cause I don't just read CRACKED. Thank you. Yeah. Okay. See you soon. What kind of shocks you got on this baby? I don't know, regular, normal ones. Nothing fancy, not my style. What are you doing? I want to put the top down. What are you No, Dwight. It's 50 degrees outside, please. But then no one can see us. I Just Would you put it up? Okay, fine, just leave it down. Whiner. Check it out. Terminator. I do not understand what you spend your money on. Hey, Oscar. These new expense reports, do we really have to go back to last quarter? Yeah, it's a terrible system, I know. What does "2005 Season" mean? Wait a minute. What is this? It's a scoreboard. What? Kevin and I play this paper football game when Michael's out. Really? KEVIN: Or when we're bored. Oh, my God. Wait, this goes back two years. We're bored a lot. (JIM EXCLAIMING) Sweet. Yes, so close. I really love the "paper triangle flicking and hitting things" game. Yeah. We call it "Hate Ball." Why? Because of how much Angela hates it. Hey, do you guys have any other games? Sometimes we play "who can put the most M&amp;M;'s in their mouth." You play that. You should ask Toby to teach you "Dunder Ball." Home, sweet home. Which one's yours? Right there. My sanctuary, my party-pad. Someday, I can just see my grandkids learning how to walk out here. Hang a swing from this tree, push them back Wait. No, it's this one right here. Home, sweet home. So that's what this sound is all day. Michael, this is Bill. He's the head of the condo association. Oh, hey, how are you? Nice to meet you, Bill. Bill, Mr. Bill. (IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE) Oh, no, Mr. Bill! SNL. When they pull him apart? He would always get rolled over by something. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, too. This is smaller than your old place. Yes, well, I'm buying it. I'm not renting it. So, it's still an upgrade. He doesn't know anything about property ownership. He's kind of an idiot. DWIGHT: Actually, I do own property. My grandfather left me a 60 acre working beet farm. I run it with my cousin Moes. We sell beets to local stores and restaurants. It's a nice little farm. Sometimes teenagers use it for sex. Are we ready to sign some papers? Actually, no, we have a couple of questions. About the neighborhood. It's very safe. It's very clean. Also, it's very accepting of all lifestyles. It's a very gay-friendly neighborhood. Oh, good, that's good. It's good to be accommodating of that. Let's go check out the master bedroom. Stanley, I just played Dunder Ball with Toby. What about you? You got any games? Yeah, I got a game. It's called "work hard, so my kids can go to college." Fair enough. This, my friends, is the master bedroom. Check out the cathedral ceilings. Those are, like, 17 feet high. We have cable readiness right there. I'm going to totally pimp this place out. I'm going to put a surround sound system. I'm going to put a plasma screen right against this wall. Oh, terrible idea. Here's where I'm putting my bed, right here. No, no, no, no, this is a shared wall. Neighbor throws his wife into the wall, plasma screen hits the floor, totally smashed. Well, then I will get a warranty. Warranties don't cover it. Plus they're a rip-off. Well, then I won't get a warranty. Wait. So, that's the problem, it's solved. What? NEIGHBOR: I don't hear you practicing. (WHISPERING) Listen. Can you hear that? (DOUBLE BASS PLAYING) Oh, man, these babies are thin. (HUMMING OLYMPIC ANTHEM) This scented candle, which I found in the men's bathroom, represents the eternal burning of competition, or something. It smells like cookies. Yes, it does. Yes, it does, my friend. Okay, we will be competing for gold, silver and bronze yogurt lids. Now, the bronze are really blue and they're also the backside of the gold, so no flipping. Okay, honor system. ANGELA: I do play games. I sing and I dangle things in front of my cats. I play lots of games, just not at work. Let the games begin. (ALL HUMMING ANTHEM) And then I just need you to sign here at this arrow. What kind of mortgage did you get? Ten year. Well, 10 over 30. So 30 year total. What? What? You said 10. Ten year fixed, over 30, 30 year total. Oh, 30 years. Okay, okay, okay. Wow, you'll be paying this off in your mid-70s. All right. Forget about retiring when you're 65. Hey, I have an idea. You know that extra bedroom? If the whole girlfriend thing never happens, that's where the nurse can live. Okay, all right. Oh, boy. Okay, now, this is it. Whenever you're ready. Yeah. Oh, okay, is that supposed to come off? Actually, yeah. DWIGHT: Hey, look, cool, carpenter ants. I'm going to take a little breather for a second, excuse me. We'll be here waiting for you. Oh, man. A 30-year mortgage at Michael's age essentially means that he's buying a coffin. Now, if I were buying my coffin, I would get one with thicker walls so you couldn't hear the other dead people. CAROL: Whenever you're ready, Michael. You have what is the national sport of Icelandic paper companies. And I'm blanking on the name. Could you help me out, Pam? Jim, they refer to it as "Flonkerton." In English, "box-of-paper snowshoe racing." Fair enough, but I like Flonkerton. The thing about Jim is when he's excited about something, like the Office Olympics, he gets really into it and he does a really great job. But the problem with Jim is that he works here, so that hardly ever happens. So, who will be challenging Kevin in Flonkerton? Anyone? I'll do it. Yes, Phyllis. (ALL CLAPPING) Phyllis. Phyllis, if you just put your foot right through here, right through the flonk. The ceilings are lower than they were last week. That I don't What? I don't know if you showed me the same unit or not. Michael, this is the unit you saw. And where are all the hot people? I was told that there would be all these attractive singles. Who told you that? And as far as I can tell, I'm the best-Iooking person here. There's a basic principle in real estate, that you should never be the best-Iooking person in the development. It's just sort of common sense. Because if you are, then you've no place to go but down. Is this a financial thing? If it's a financial thing, what some people do is they rent out the third bedroom. That's an extra income for you. No, no. I'm not going to rent the third bedroom. I want a price reduction or I am a-walking. You will lose $7,000 if you walk away right now. I made the right decision. I'm glad I signed. Look, I'm a homeowner. Right? Good to be a homeowner, diversified. This is good. This is fun. We're having fun. Totally having fun. Can you imagine those poor saps stuck at the office today? (LAUGHING) Here we go. Here we go. WOMAN: Go, go, go! MAN: Pair of shoes. Dig deep. Dig deep. (ALL EXCLAIMING) It's Phyllis, Phyllis by a nose. Gold medal in Flernenton. Flonkerton. Thank you, delegate from Iceland. Wow, okay, no one else should even try. Gold medals. Give him medals. Wow. (EMPLOYEES EXCLAIMING) There's something else, Dwight, I want to talk to you about. I have a surprise for you, for helping me out today. Oh, you didn't have to No, no, I insist, I insist. Because you've really done some great work, great work. And that is why I'm going to let you move into my third bedroom and pay me rent. (EXCLAIMS) Why did I do it? Because I believe in rewarding people for their efforts. I rewarded Dwight with the room and he is rewarding me back with $500 plus utilities. I don't even know what to say. I'm thinking, lock you into a four-year commitment. We'll go month-to-month after that. Or until I start dating, have a girlfriend and then, you're You know, you're gone. So Question. Where can I put my terrarium? What the hell is a terrarium? It's a fish tank for snakes and lizards. Oh, so, an aquarium? That will not come into this place, okay? Question. Oh, my God. My grandparents left me a large number of armoires. PAM: Are you sure you don't want to play? I'm sure. Come on, Angela, don't you have a game? I have one, yes. Well, let's play. What is it? I call it "Pam-Pong." I count how many times Jim gets up from his desk and goes to reception to talk to you. We're friends. Apparently. JIM: Very nicely done. Okay, so, I think that's H.O.R. For Stanley and H.O. For Phyllis. Are you calling me a ho? Oh, my God. Phyllis coming alive, I like it. Question. What about car-pooling? Who pays for the gas? We take separate cars. Okay, question. Can sometimes I drive your car and you drive mine? Why would we do that? Just for fun. No. Okay, question. Who's the primary on the fire insurance? (MIMICKING BUZZER) Game over. Offer revoked, Dwight. I'm sorry, but you reach out and you try to be a nice guy and help out a friend and this is what happens. This is what I get. Oh, God, I'm Okay. DWIGHT: Thank God. It was nice of him to offer, but I live in a nine-bedroom farmhouse. I have my own crossbow range. It's a perfect situation for me. Although, two bathrooms would have been nice. We just have the one. And it's under the porch. Who had somebody from Vance Refrigeration? I did. Ryan Howard. Ryan, gold medal. I made something for our closing ceremonies. What? Oh, my God. Where did you have time to make that? Automatic voicemail. All right, Pam, all right. Nice work. You know, you can always refinance your mortgage. We had a 15-year on our beet farm, we paid it off early. Yeah, well, you know what? Nobody cares about your stupid beet farm. Beets are the worst. People love beets. Nobody likes beets. Everyone loves beets. Nobody likes beets, Dwight. Why don't you grow something that everybody does like? You should grow candy. I'd love a piece of candy right now. Not a beet. Let's get this roof going. Stop it! Final lap, final lap. The time to beat is 1:15. Time to beat is one minute, Here they come! MEREDITH: Go, go, go! Guys. What is going on? Nothing. Guys, timer's still going. That's my stopwatch. Here you go. All done. Great. JIM: Yeah, I filled out the expense reports. That took about five minutes and then I closed two sales at lunchtime, so, about as productive as any other day, if not more so. RYAN: I figured I could throw it away now or I could keep it for a couple of months and then throw it away. I mean, it was really nice of Pam to make them, but what am I going to do with a gold medal made of paperclips and an old yogurt lid? Hey. I have 59 voicemails. Hey, can you ignore those and do something for me, instead? Sure. Okay, today, 5:00, closing ceremonies. Really? Notify the athletes. Cool. Michael? Yeah. Jim. Slim Jim. What's going on? Nothing. I just wanted to congratulate you on your condo. Oh, thanks, thanks. It's very cool. It's three bedroom, gay-friendly. Nice. You know. Hey, would you mind coming out here for a second? I just have something for you. Really? What's this? These are the closing ceremonies. Step up. Here, on the top one. Congratulations to Michael, because he closed on his condo, so gold medal. (ALL CLAPPING) I don't really know what to say. I'm not one for making speeches, but my heart is very full at this moment. And for Dwight Schrute, the silver medal. Get on up here, Dwight. Silver medal. Yeah, not as good as gold. (THE STAR-SPANGLED BANNER PLAYING) Why are you playing the National Anthem? 'Cause your condo's in America. What the hell is that? Those are the doves. (MAN WHOOPING) MAN: All right. Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Sure, can I ask who's calling? Just a second. (TELEPHONE RINGING) Jim Halpert. What? How did you get this number? Stalker. Katy and Jim met in the office. PAM: And now, I guess they're, like, going out or dating or something. And I don't know, you know. They're just She calls him, and they You know. I'm sorry, I feel like I'm talking really loud. Am I talking really loud? So we're still on for lunch? You're meeting me here? Okay. Great. Bye. Hey, you can just give her your extension. Okay. HowardlRyan. Ryan Howard is sitting in my office. And he has been a temp here for a couple of months, and he's kind of gotten the lay of the land a little bit. Had a few laughs along the way. And now he wants to know what I think. The temp agency wants to know what you think. Shall we? Let us proceed. First up, "Proficiency in necessary skills. "Excellent." (LAUGHING) DWIGHT: Michael's in there right now evaluating the temp. He hasn't evaluated me in years. Five years from now, what do you wanna do? Where do you wanna be? Well, I'm interested in business. Oh. Good. Ambitious. Excellent. Wanna be a manager? No, actually, what I want is to own my own company. That is ridiculous. Ryan's about to attend the Michael Scott School of Business. I'm like Mr. Miyagi and Yoda rolled into one. (IMITATING YODA) "Much advice you seek." Do you know who that is? Fozzie Bear? Hmm. No. That was Yoda. There are 10 rules of business that you need to learn. Number one: You need to play to win, but you also have to win to play. Got it. And I will give you the rest of the 10 at lunch. Hey. (DOOR CLOSING) DWIGHT: Michael and I have a very special connection. He's like Batman, I'm like Robin. He's like the Lone Ranger and I'm like Tonto. And it's not like there was the Lone Ranger and Tonto and Bonto. (FIRE ALARM RINGING) People! Okay, everybody! This is not a test. Move to the exits. Devon, head towards the exit. Do not panic! Get up off your desks. OSCAR: No, I don't wanna hear it. All right? Let's go, people! No panic is warranted. Do not panic! Go in a single-file line. This is not a drill! Arms at your side! Arms at your side! DWIGHT: Please, move quickly! This is a paper company, people. Step lively. This whole place is a tinderbox. It is ready to blow. This is not a test. Can you leave? Oh, you say that every time. (SCREAMING) Do you wanna die? Oh, God. Do you wanna die? Out! All right, let's go, let's go, let's go. Stanley, have you ever seen a burn victim? Move to the exits. Come on, your safety partners. Your safety partners. Let's go! Real smoke! We've got smoke! Smoke! God! Oh, Kelly! Are you okay? I got you! I'm okay! Cover your nose and mouth. Hey, let go of me! Breathe through your nose. Let go of me! Breathe through your nose. Remove your stockings, okay? They'll melt right into your flesh. Stay below the smoke line. Let's go! Clear out, stat! Stat means now! MICHAEL: Yes, I was the first one out. And, yes, I've heard women and children first, but we do not employ children. We are not a sweatshop, thankfully. And women are equal in the workplace by law. So, I let them out first, I've a lawsuit on my hands. Another rule of business is being able to adapt to different situations. Yeah? Mmm-hmm. Adapt. React. Readapt. Apt. All right? That's rule number two. Okay, guys, listen up. We need a head count. Okay, we need to count off. Michael's number one. Where is he? Where's he? So, what was rule two? Adapt, react, readapt, apt. Okay, well, let's just kind of take it a little slower. Hey, Michael, Ryan needs a number for the count off. Okay, well, "1" is taken. Okay, "2"? No! Oh, sorry. Okay. He can have "14." Marjorie's not here today. MICHAEL: Well, he needs a permanent number, right? No, I don't. Oh, you know what else? I thought of a nickname for the three of us. Three Musketeers. Yeah, okay. Yeah. No, no, no. I got one, I got one. The Three Stooges. DWIGHT: That's funny, too. But if we're the Three Musketeers I don't wanna be, like, a guy here, you know? Like, Stanley is the crossword-puzzle guy and Angela has cats. I don't wanna have a thing here. You know, I don't wanna be the "something guy." Okay, you know what? I think I'm gonna be setting the agenda here, okay? Can everybody gather up, please? Important announcement. Very important announcement. I think this is a perfect opportunity for all of us to participate in some really intense, psychologically revealing conversations. So, we're gonna be playing "desert island," um (SIREN APPROACHING) "Who would you do" and "Would you rather." "Would you rather." "Would you rather" is our third game. (HORN HONKING) Yeah! Hey, guys. Great response time. Listen up. I got some theories. Okay, there's a Okay, so three books on a desert island, Angela. The Bible. That's one book. You've got two others. A Purpose Driven Life. Nice. Third book. No. Okay, Phyllis. The Da Vinci Code. The Da Vinci Code. I would take The Da Vinci Code, so I could burn The Da Vinci Code. Okay, great. That's gonna keep you warm for, like, seven seconds. Question, is there firewood on the island? I guess. Then I would bring an axe, no books. JIM: No, it has to be a book, Dwight. Fine. Physician's Desk Reference. Nice. Smart. Hollowed out. Inside, water proof matches, iodine tablets, beet seeds, protein bars, NASA blanket, and, in case I get bored, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. No, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Question, did my shoes come off in the plane crash? Rule number four: In business image is everything. Andre Agassi. This car is an investment, right? If I have to take out a client or I'm seen around Scranton in it I love it. I love this car. Do you like it? Yeah. JIM: Okay, thought people read more books. DVDs. Five movies, what would you bring to the island? Yes, Meredith. Legends of the Fall, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Legally Blonde, Bridges of Madison County. Wow. Legends of the Fall. Wow. Bridges of Madison County. Legally Blonde. These movies are just Well, I kind of like Legally Wait, wait, wait. Pam, no. Do you understand? The game is "desert island movies," not "guilty pleasure movies." Desert island movies are the movies you're gonna watch for the rest of your life. Forever. Unforgivable. I take it back. Unforgivable. I take it back. Good. And, Ghost. But just that one scene. Is this your car, Ryan? Well, sir, I don't Some pretty big books back there. Good shocks. Hello, Mr. Egghead. (LAUGHS) Oh, Stanley Kaplan. I know him. "M" is for Murder, "P" is for That's actually a test-prep book. for Phone. What? That's a test-prep for business school. Oh, thinking about business school? I just got in. I applied. I go at night. Really? So, you think you know a lot about business? No, not yet. Just started. Uh-huh. Yeah. Quiz me. I wouldn't even know where to start. Oh, come on. Come on, egghead, let's do it. DWIGHT: Do it. Quiz me up. All right. Why have people been rethinking the Microsoft model in the past few years? When I was Ryan's age, I worked in a fast food restaurant to save up money for school. And then I lost it in a pyramid scheme, but I learned more about business right then and there than business school would ever teach me or Ryan would ever teach me. Is it cheaper to sign a new customer or to keep an existing customer? Keep an existing cust Shut it. Can I just do it, please? It's equal. It is 10 times more expensive to sign a new customer. Okay. Yes, it was a trick question, okay. Look, I mean, he didn't need business school, okay? Michael comes from the school of hard knocks. All right. Okay, Dwight Self-taught. You didn't even go to college. You know what? You don't need to help me here, okay? You know, maybe you should go to business school like Ryan. Then you'd know what you're talking about. DWIGHT: Come on. So I'm studying with the master. Reference. Why don't you go to business You should learn from him, right? Right? Right? Stop it, Dwight. You know what, Dwight? You're acting like a dork. Would you cool it, please? Okay. Hey, he's not your five-year-old brother, Dwight. He's a valued member of this company. And you know what? He knows more about business than you ever will. Stupid. MICHAEL: I did not go to business school. You know who else didn't go to business school? Lebron James, Tracy McGrady, Kobe Bryant. They went right from high school to the NBA, so So, it's not the same thing at all. Look at this stuff. "Market fragments." What is that supposed to be? It's a way of looking at consumers as subsets of a larger client base. You are so smart. You are so effing smart. You should be teaching me. Pam, get us back into it. Okay. JIM: Five movies. Go ahead. Fargo, Edward Scissorhands, Dazed and Confused. Oh, definitely in my top five. Yes, in my top three, so suck it. Breakfast Club. What? The Princess Bride and Okay, that's five. No, my all-time favorite! JIM: Pam, play by the rules. PAM: All-time favorite! Play by the rules. Dwight, all-time favorite movie. DWIGHT: The Crow. I became a salesman because of people. I love making friends. But then I was promoted to manager, very young age. I still try to be a friend first, but, you know, when you're very successful, your co-workers look at you differently. (SIGHING) What do you think? Maybe we should get some air. No, I'm okay. I'm really uncomfortable. All right. Let's move on. Let's move on to the main event, "Who would you do?" Present company excluded? Not necessarily. Pam. Pam. JIM: Um Okay. You know what? Maybe I'll finish explaining the rules. Let me explain it first and then (EVERYBODY HURTS PLAYING ON CAR STEREO) Yeah, so we'll get right You know what? I'll be right back. Stanley, you're taking over for me, buddy. I'll be right back. Okay. Dwight. (TURNS UP VOLUME) Dwight! Come one, Dwight, use words. Why didn't I go to business school? Who goes to business school? The temp. He does? Yeah, it's all him and Michael talk about anymore. You know, I bet Ryan thinks to himself, "I wish I were a volunteer sheriff on the weekend." He doesn't even know that I do that. PAM: You should tell him. Oh, yeah, Pam, right. That's gonna help things. Just talk it out. I hope the war goes on forever and Ryan gets drafted. Dwight. What? I'm sorry I said that. I didn't Just part of me meant it. Besides, he'd end up being a hero anyway. You know what you should do? You should quit. And then, that would stick it to both of them. No, Jim. I'm not gonna quit. Then Ryan wins. Yeah, you're right. Thanks, you guys. I just need some alone time. Okay. All right, buddy. (EVERYBODY HURTS PLAYING ON CAR STEREO) (LAUGHING) Hey. Guys, what's going on? Nothing. Hey. What's up? Can I hang out with you guys for a bit? The warehouse guys are a bunch of jackasses sometimes. Come on, people, you know the rules of the game, now. Hey, gang. What game are we playing here? Okay, it's called, "Who would you do?" Oh, I play this at home all the time while I'm falling asleep. What Where are we? Where are we here? Roy. Roy? Roy? Who would you do, Roy? Oh, I got it. What's the name of that tight-ass Christian chick. The blonde? My name is Angela. Hey, Angela. Roy, nice to meet you. All right, who's next? Who's next? Who's next? Who's Jim? You're next. Who would you do? Kevin, hands down. Yeah, I mean he's really got that teddy bear thing going on and afterwards we could just watch bowling. Well, I would definitely have sex with Ryan, 'cause he is gonna own his own business. You're all gay. Who's next? Who we got? (CELL PHONE RINGING) Who Hey. No, I can talk. I can talk. I can talk. Yeah, it's a great time. Well, I wish I had my cell phone, but I left it inside, so Would that make you happy? What's that? If you had your cell phone, it would make you happy? Yeah. I'm on it. Dwight. Hey, Dwight! You can't go back in yet. He is an idiot. The man is an idiot, ladies and gentlemen. What if he dies in the fire, and that's the last thing you ever said to him? I didn't say it to him. I said it about him. Jim? Definitely Jim. Definitely, definitely Jim. Come on, Pam. Come on. What about you, Pam? Oscar's kind of cute. Yeah, I like Oscar. Ooh, Toby. How long does it take to find a cell phone? (SCOFFS) I don't know either. Is there anybody else? (CLEARS THROAT) Hey, where are you? Oh, good. Yeah, we're just here. We're playing "desert island." It's when you pick your five favorite DVDs. Seriously, where the hell is Dwight? (CLEARS THROAT) Hey, call my cell phone. It'll make it easier for him to find. What's your number? I gave it to you in the car. I saw you program it in. You gotta give it to me again. Okay. All right. Now I have it. (CELL PHONE RINGING) Uh I better tell somebody. Excuse me, sir? Dwight! Dwight! Oh, God, man! Why did you go in there? What? Everybody was scared out of their wits, man. Everyone, okay, I have an announcement. Apparently, in business school, they don't teach you how to operate a toaster oven, because some smart, sexy temp left his cheese pita on "oven" instead of timing it for the toaster thing. Oh, wow, okay. Well, I guess they don't teach how to operate a toaster oven in business school. That's exactly what I said. Hey, did you miss that day, there, Ryan? DWIGHT: Were you absent? MICHAEL: Toaster Oven 101. DWIGHT: You failed? I'm so sorry. Oh, man. "Hey, I know what'll impress everybody. I'll start a fire." Oh, man. Bad idea. Bad idea jeans. I have a song, attention everyone, that I wanna sing, that I wrote especially for this occasion when I was up there among the flames. Ready? Ryan started the fire! It was always burning since the world's been turning! Ryan started the fire! Ryan started the fire! It was always burning since the world was turning! Everybody! I can't believe I started the fire. (SCATTING) Marilyn Monroe! Ryan started the fire! Ryan started the fire! It was always burning DWIGHT: Eat it. Yeah, eat it. You have to eat it. KATY: Hey. Hey. How are you? Good. How are you? I'm good. It's good to see you. Good to see you, too. I'm hungry. Yeah, I am, too. Oh, I have been thinking the whole way over, and I have my answers. What answers? For the "desert island." Oh, right! Right, right, right. Come on, come on. Ladies and gentlemen, gather around. We have one more participant. Come on, be polite. Be polite. Hi. Desert island, five movies, go. Okay, first, Legally Blonde. (GIGGLING) I forgot what a super-nice girl Katy is. And just good for Jim. They are so cute together. And what an adorable car. Okay, I think the game's over. People are, like, leaving. There was a bigger crowd last time. Do you wanna just go to lunch? Okay. Yeah? All right. You wanna drive? Sure. All right. They are so cute. I'm really sorry, Dwight. Answer me this, though. What? Was it worth it? Was it worth it, temp? No. Was it worth it? Really? I'm really sorry, Dwight. The fire guy. The fire guy! Joe McCarthy, Richard Nixon Studebaker, Television North Korea, South Korea, Marilyn Monroe! Ryan started the fire! Okay, rule five: Safety first, i.e. Don't burn the building down. Okay? That should be a no-brainer. Oh, look, Ryan is book smart, and I am street smart and book smart. I'll give you the rest of the 10 tomorrow. Happy Halloween, everyone! Oh, that's great. Hey. Happy Halloween. Jan called. (SIGHS) Okay. I know why she's calling. It's the end of the month, and I was supposed to let somebody go by the end of the month. (SIGHS) And somehow I'm supposed to put on a costume and smile. (TELEPHONE RINGING) Okay. SHERRY: Jan Levinson's office. Hey, Sherry, Michael Scott returning. Oh, she's in a meeting. She just wanted the name of the employee you let go. Well, I'm gonna wait until the end of the day, because the book said it's best to wait until the end of the day. I just need the name of who you're planning to let go. I don't know yet. I will have to call her back. I know she wanted the name. Okay, Sherry? Yeah. If you were getting fired, how would you wanna be told so that you could still be friends with the person firing you? Jan wants the name as soon as possible, Michael. Thanks. I'll call her back. I wish I could fire Sherry. Hey, I'm still here. Okay. I'm sorry. Yeah. No. Okay. Bye. Hanging up now. I mean, you hear about layoffs in the news, but when you actually have to do it yourself, it is heavy stuff. It's I mean, these are people's lives you're talking about. You wanted me? Yes. Papier-mache? Yes. Yes. Um Pam, I have to let somebody go today. This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do. Why did you put it off until Halloween? Because it's very scary stuff. I think it's gonna put a damper on the party a little. You're worried about the party? There's a man's life at stake here. So it's a man? No. Or woman. A human life. If you had to guess who it would be based on their job performance and who you think deserves to be fired, who would that be? I just answer the phone. And sometimes you just let it go to voicemail. Your costume is fantastic. I know. I sent away for it in July from a catalog. PAM: Oh, no. Don't, don't, don't, don't. (SCREECHING) Okay. Oh, man. Okay, I have to fire somebody. What is that? What are you supposed to be? I'm the three-hole punch version of Jim, 'cause you can have me either way, plain white Jim or three-hole punch. That's great. I like it. JIM: Oh? Yeah. Yeah, well, look. What about me? (HISSING) What are What are you? A monk? I'm a Sith lord. Oh, big deal. Three round pieces of paper taped to a shirt. This cost me $129. Ass. Hey, you guys excited about the party? It's gonna be fun. Yeah. Yes. Oh, and look at you. Showing your colors. Don't you wish you wore a dress every day. What are you implying? All good. Happy Halloween. What happened to all of those spooky decorations that we had, the cobwebs and such? Yeah, I don't know. We put them all up last night. (SIGHS) Well, you know what? Go buy some more. I'll approve the overages. Sound good? Yeah. Good. Oh, yeah, also, about budget stuff Um I'm gonna need you to find, like, a full employee salary plus benefits. Like 50 grand. I'm gonna need you to find 50 grand in the numbers. But we don't keep two sets of books. Well, that's not what I'm saying. Just, you know, find it. Pretend that your jobs depend on it. (LAUGHS) Interesting take on Dorothy. I love it. Hey, you know what would even be better? A soccer ball and cleats. Why is that? Bend It Like Beckham. Oh, like the movie about the Indian girl who plays soccer? Yeah, that would be perfect. Yeah, I mean, I guess I could do that. It'd be funny. I don't really play soccer or anything. Well, I don't really have two heads. So Wait, what are you again? Oh, right. Three-hole punch! Okay, greatest strength. Okay, okay. A dog-like obedience to authority. Nice. But that doesn't sound good. Okay, okay. How about the ultimate team player? Dwight is special. But I don't believe that his talents are being used in this office. So Pam and I have put his resume on Monster. Com, Google, Craig's List. We're really interested most in jobs that take Dwight out of state. Preferably Alaska or India. (WHISPERING) He's a gun nut. (GRUNTING) (WHISPERING) Sticks to his guns. Well, I looked through all the budgets and there is one department Yes. that has three people Yeah. doing the work that could be done by two. This is great. Oh. Yeah. Oh. Who do you think it should be? Jim, definitely. No, Jim brings in money. Phyllis? No. Stanley, Pam, Oscar, Meredith, Kevin, Angela. It's not a popularity contest. Although it does make sense to fire the least popular because that has the least effect on morale. One of the warehouse guys. What? There is someone left off that list? Who? Who is he saying? (GASPS) You're right. I didn't even think of him. No, Michael. Yeah, that's actually a really good idea. No. No. Not me. Yeah, I could. Not Dwight. I'm not saying that's what he said. I know that's what he said. What? Tell him not Dwight. That is not a very nice thing to say about him. Tell him to stop. Are you kidding? Quiet, you! I agree. He'd land on his feet. Make him be quiet. Those aren't chips and dip. No, I made brownies. (EXCLAIMS) What? I'm just trying to figure out why you're sabotaging things. I made brownies. And I made cookies. Same category. (SIGHS) I'm guessing Angela's the one in the neighborhood who gives the trick-or-treaters some toothbrushes, pennies, walnuts Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Yeah. Just one second. I will transfer you to our manager, Michael Scott. (TELEPHONE RINGS) Wow. Michael Scott here. Yes, I am regional manager of this orifice. Hmm-hmm. Dwight Schrute is amazing. Yeah. No, he is actually the single greatest employee of his generation. Hmm-hmm. You know what? I'm gonna tell you what. You hire Dwight K. Schrute and he does not meet, nay, exceed every one of your wildest expectations, well, then, you can hold me, Michael Gary Scott personally and financially responsible. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Stanley, could you come with me, please? No. As Assistant Regional Manager To the? Look, I've got some bad news. You're fired. You need to pack up your things and go. I'm serious, Stanley. It's over. I'm sorry. "You're fired." Get your fingers off my phone. So, how did it go with Stanley? How did he take it? He wouldn't listen to me. Oh, come on. If you wanna fire him, you're gonna have to tell him yourself. I don't wanna fire Stanley. I never said that. I'm certainly not going to do it myself. Get those big baleful eyes staring at me. Yikes. Just Okay, just Cumberland Mills? And how did you get my resume? Oh, no, no. I'm very flattered. Don't get me wrong. I'm just not sure that it's my official resume or if it's something that maybe a satisfied customer posted online. What does it say under martial arts training? Oh, okay, I'm gonna have to supplement that. Could I have your fax number? Would I ever leave this company? Look, I'm all about loyalty. In fact, I feel like part of what I'm getting paid for here is my loyalty. But if there were somewhere else that valued that loyalty more highly, I'm going wherever they value loyalty the most. Oh, hey. Oh, your dress is stuck in the back. Gotta just Oh. So you got the fax. So why didn't you add it to the resume? What do you mean? Of course, martial arts training is relevant. Oh, excuse me, I know about a billion Asians that would beg to differ. Yeah, I get a little frustrated when I'm dealing with incompetence! Well, you know what? You can go to hell, too, and I will see you there burning. Fine. Oh, wait, so you'll let me know when you've made a decision Jim is really talented. And he should be the one who's getting a better job offer. Like, for real. Don't take this the wrong way, but you should go for that job. Um It's in Maryland. Yeah. But, I mean, look at the salary, and it's definitely a step up and a challenge. Yeah. Yeah. You know what, maybe Maybe I will. Jim. This is called leveraging an offer. Michael, can I talk to you for a moment? Oh, God. I just thought you should know that I was just offered a job with better pay, better benefits, and a better title at Cumberland Mills. Fantastic. And I turned it down. What? That would have solved all my problems. Out of loyalty to this company. Oh, you idiot. Go. So I was hoping to be made Assistant Regional Manager officially. If you left, I wouldn't have to fire anybody. But then you wouldn't have me here. Big deal. Oh, it would have worked out so well. Can you get it back? It's in Maryland. You could call. Can you call them? I can't I suppose I No. (YELLING) They never really made me an offer anyway. Why are you torturing me? God. Honestly, I don't think Michael has the slightest clue of who he's gonna fire. I think he keeps hoping that someone's gonna volunteer, or be run over by a bus before the deadline. But in the end, really, what's gonna happen is it's gonna be the first person to give him a dirty look in the hall. And therein lies the true essence of his charisma. (MICHAEL CLEARS THROAT) Can I speak to you a minute? Yes. Michael, I really didn't mean to Help me. I'm sorry? I want you to role-play firing me. I want you to fire me, and I will take it. Oh, you want me to be you. Yes. Okay. I want you to be me and I will be Creed. Oh, are you firing Creed? No, no, no. That's just first thing Came Can't That head We should switch seats in order to Yes, that's a good idea. All right? Excuse me. (CLEARS THROAT) I'm really sorry, but I have to let you go. And it's purely budgetary. It's not personal (SCREAMING) I'm gonna kill myself! Wow. I'm going to kill myself and it's your fault! That's an overreaction. Corporate is really breathing down my neck and they're saying this has to be done by the end of the month Is this you? Are you being you? Or is this Creed? Are you I am This is Creed. Okay. I'm improvising. So just try to keep up. And I'm very angry. Hold that thought. And I want I'm gonna kill you. Michael Scott here. I'm gonna kill you for firing me. Toby. I really have to take this, Creed, so it was really a pleasure working with you, okay? Get off. Get off. No, no. Just get up. Just, just Yeah. (SIGHS) What happened? It wasn't me. Oh, that was, like, crazy, because I was Yeah, I know. Hey, Creed? Could I talk to you for a second? You are great and very ambitious, and I feel like you want more than this little office has to offer. And I understand that you'd want to just spread your wings and fly the coop. What are you telling me? We're gonna have to You want something better. No, I don't. I wanna stay right here. No, you wanna leave. No, I wanna stay here. Now, why are you making this so hard? I think there's a misunderstanding about this. I think you're right. Can I go? No, of course you can't go! We haven't even started this horrible process of Okay, Creed. I need to let somebody go today. They told me I need to let somebody go. And as much as I think you're a great guy, and I like you, you're Goodbye. Let's fight it. Let's call Jan and fight this thing together like the old days. What old days? What are you talking about? Did you start the paperwork yet? It's right here on the desk, yeah. You don't have to do this, Michael. I can't, though. Undo it! I can't change anything. This is the way it No. You have the power to undo it. I don't. Okay, just let's not You can undo it. Michael, undo it! Yeah, I went hunting once. Shot the deer in the leg. Had to kill it with a shovel, took about an hour. Why do you ask? I have to fire someone today. Okay? Fine. Fire someone else. Fire Devon. He's terrible. I am so much better at my job than Devon. Okay, well, I already picked you and you know that, so, unless I just go through with this, you're always gonna look at me as the guy who almost fired you. No, no, no, no, no, no. I will forget so fast. You will be my savior. You're the guy who gave me my life back. Thank you. I knew you'd see it my way, Michael. God bless you. You're a fine man. Don't Listen, you will not regret this, either. Devon is terrible. No one's gonna miss him. Good, good, good, good. (DOOR OPENS) Devon, could I talk to you for a second? Creed's an idiot. You know that. Well, he No, no, no, no, no, no. You had it right the first time! Well, maybe I did. Exactly, you gotta go with your gut, man. (SIGHS) No, I can't No, I can't go back. I would look like an idiot. That's why I'm being fired? No. So you might not look like an idiot? No, it was all the stuff that I said. It was the business downturn and cutbacks, and You God, this is unbelievable! I just hope that you and I can remain friends. Devon, wait. Please. What? Look, look. In addition to severance and everything, I want to give you this gift certificate to Chili's from me. Okay? No hard feelings. Kevin, Jim, Pam, Kelly, Toby, Oscar, Meredith, Phyllis, Stanley, or the temp. If any of you wanna meet me for a drink, I'm gonna be at Poor Richard's. And the rest of you can go to hell. (DOOR SLAMS) What about the Halloween party? Oh, hey, Jim. Wait, stop. I'm sorry for pushing you toward Cumberland. Seriously, if you left here, I would blow my brains out. Come on. JIM: That's just a figure of speech, you know. Blow your brains out? Come on. All it really means is that we're friends. And who else is she gonna talk to if I'm gone? Right? I mean, if she left, I wouldn't blow my brains out. Of course, I would take that job in Maryland because it's double the pay and soft-shell crab just happens to be my favorite food. MICHAEL: I love Halloween. You know, it's just But it's just fun. Every year, it's just fun. Last Halloween, I came as Janet Jackson's boob. (MICHAEL LAUGHS) It was topical. People got a big kick out of it. The year before that I came as Monica Lewinsky, and I wore a stained dress. The year before that, I also came as Monica Lewinsky, and before that I was O.J. It was pretty funny. Oh, I wish you were here last year. (DOORBELL RINGS) KIDS: Trick-or-treat! Hey. How you doing? Wow, you guys look great! I'm a bumble bee. You look great. And you're a princess? A fairy princess. A fairy princess. You're very I'm a lion! You're a lion. Wow. I wanna hear your Oh! Okay, that's all yours. That's all yours. Okay! Grab it. Grab it. You know what? You guys are getting all of these. Where is my desk? That is weird. This is not funny. This is totally unprofessional. Okay, well, you're the one who lost the desk. I didn't lose my desk. Hey, calm down. Where was the last place you saw it? Okay, who moved my desk? JIM: I think you should retrace your steps. Okay, I am going to tell Michael and this entire office will be punished. Colder. Warmer. A little warmer. There you go. Warmer. Warmer. Warmer. Warmer. Warmer. Cold. Cold. Cold. Back up. (JIM EXCLAIMS) (TELEPHONE RINGING) Warmer. Hot. Red hot. Hot. Very hot. (TELEPHONE CONTINUES RINGING) Dwight Schrute. Hi, Dwight. What sort of discounts are we giving on the 20-Ib. White bond? Jim, I've given you this information, like, 20 times. JIM: I know. (TOILET FLUSHING) It's by the ream? Yeah. Ream It is now $9.78, so it's a discount of 7%. Okay, thank you. Got to get back to work. Wash your hands, Kevin. Right. Oh, let me just check the pricing list. Hold on one second. Sensei, hello, it's Sempai. Dwight. You know what, let me give you a call right back. I'm gonna find it and then I'll call you back. Thanks. Yes, I just had a question Yes, Sensei. (SPEAKING JAPANESE) Was that your mom? No, that was my sensei. Oh, I thought it was your mom. I am now Sempai, which is Assistant Sensei. Assistant to the Sensei, that's pretty cool. Assistant Sensei. Okay. I am a practitioner of Goju-Ryu Karate here in Scranton. (SHOUTING) SENSEl: Two! Dwight, snap your kick back. Three! DWIGHT: My sensei, Ira, recently promoted me to purple belt. And gave me the duties of a sempai. Not that a lot of people here in America know what a sempai is. But it's equally as respected as a sensei. I don't wanna stay until 7:00 again this year. I don't really have any control over that, Stanley. Michael tends to procrastinate a bit whenever he has to do work. Time cards, he has to sign these every Friday. Purchase orders have to be approved at the end of every month. And expense reports, all he has to do is initial these at the end of every quarter. But once a year it all falls on the same Friday. That's today. I call it the perfect storm. (SINGING) I don't wanna work I just wanna bang on this mug all day Did you ask me here for any specific reason? Yes, I did. Here's the dizzle. I have a very top-secret mission for you. I want you to update all the emergency contact information. Why is that secret? Hello. Oh, God. Busywork. Oh, get away, cretin. PAM: I put stickers, so you know where to sign. Yes, thanks, I know where to sign. It's just that last year you Yeah, well, last year they were out of order, weren't they, Pam? Well, the last pick-up for overnight deliveries is at 7:00. So you need to have them signed by then, or much earlier. Chillax, Pam. Stop Pam-MS-ing. That's pretty good. Actually I'm sending Ryan on a top-secret mission. Tell her what it is. Updating emergency contacts. Well, is that really a priority? Is it a priority? Oh, I don't know. What if there's a tornado, Pam? People's legs are crushed under rubble? Please, would you be so kind as to call my wife? No, I can't, because we don't have any emergency contact information, because Pam said it wasn't a priority. Think. Think with your head, Pam. Okay, well, she walks out. That's the problem with being a boss, is that when you are tough they resent you and when you are cool they walk all over you. Catch-22. Catch-22. Yes. Why don't you give me your contact information to start with? Okay, what's your cell? Larissa Halpert. What's her address? (CELL PHONE RINGING) Hello? MICHAEL: (IN SHRILL VOICE) Hey, Ryan! This is Michael Jackson calling from Wonderland. You mean Neverland? This is Tito. (LAUGHING) What? Calling from Your major and minor lines cross at a ridge. That sucks. You're making this up as you go along, aren't you? I am just following the website. Well, at least I don't have cavities. Yes, you have very nice teeth. Thanks. Who's your emergency contact? (CELL PHONE RINGING) Stacey. (KNOCKING ON WINDOW) Pick up! Hello? (IN SHRILL VOICE) This is Mike Tyson. (SNIGGERING) Hey, Dwight? As sempai, do you ever think that there's gonna be a day where humans and robots can peacefully coexist? Impossible. The way they're programmed You're mocking me. No, I'm not. Well, let me offer you a little piece of advice. I am not afraid to make an example out of you. Well, that's not advice. What advice sounds like is this: Don't ever bring your purple belt to work because someone might steal it. Okay, give that back to me. Okay. Say "please." No. That is not a toy. Please? Please! Good. And it absolutely is a toy. Arigato. Arigato. This is not a toy. This is a message for the entire office. So that everyone can see that I am capable of physically dominating them. And this is more of a ying-yang thing. The "Michael" is all cursives, "Scott" all caps. Left brain, right brain, or duality of man. (KNOCKING ON WINDOW) Could you practice on the forms? No women or children, unless provoked. Okay. Roy. Warehouse guy, doesn't count. Okay. Michael. Could you beat up Michael? Yeah, I don't think that would happen. Because we're friends. Because I would kick his ass. Well, Dwight's a purple belt, so So? I've beat up black belts. Yeah. And how did you know they were black belts? They told me after. See, I used to run with a very tough crowd, street fighter types. Real, real bad people. I'm just lucky I got out. Is your wife still your contact? Ex-wife. Yeah. Her last name's Becker now. Okay. You don't need to write "Ex." And after that, nobody ever messed with the Damn Rascals ever again. Sounds tough. When you're a Jet, you're a Jet all the way, right? You're a jet? Have you signed the expense reports yet? Yes, in theory I have. I just need to cross some t's and dot some i's. All right. I am going to be in my office, if anybody needs me. (EXCLAIMS) Michael! Oh, wow! Sleeper hold! Bedtime for Bonzo. (MICHAEL SHUSHING) (MICHAEL EXCLAIMS) You are the weakest link! (YELLS) I'm friends with everybody in this office. We're all best friends. I love everybody here. But sometimes your best friends start coming into work late, and start having dentist appointments that aren't dentist appointments, and that is when it's nice to let them know that you could beat them up. Just hit me, you'll see. I can't, 'cause I just got a manicure, so Oh, queer! Eye Queer Eye, that's a good show. Important show. Go ahead. Do it. Just have Dwight punch you. Oh, yeah. Well, that would be kind of worthless because I know a ton of 14-year-old girls who could kick his ass. You know a ton of 14-year-old girls? What belt are they? Look, Dwight is a wuss. When we rented Armageddon No. he cried at the end of it. He did. DWIGHT: Michael, I told you. That was because it was New Year's Eve and it started to snow at exactly midnight. "Bruce Willis, they're gonna leave him on the asteroid." Okay, I'll punch you. Oh, okay, here we go. All right, come on. (EXCLAIMS) (SCREAMS) (GROANING) Did I want to harm Michael? The one man I've been hired to protect? No, I did not. Are you okay? Yes. Are you sure you're all right? Yep, yep. Thank you. I come from a long line of fighters. My maternal grandfather was the toughest guy I ever knew. World War II veteran, killed 20 men, then spent the rest of the war in an Allied prison camp. My father battled blood pressure and obesity all his life. Different kind of fight. Okay, he has to be stopped. Please, please, please, please, just ask Michael. I don't know. (EXCLAIMS) Okay, I'll buy you a bag of chips. French onion? Obviously. Why are you spinning around? Okay. Yes. Take this pen, okay, stab me with it. MICHAEL: Go away. I just have a quick question. I haven't signed them, okay? No, it's not that. I was just wondering, since I'm probably gonna have to stay late, could you ask Dwight to stay late, too, so he can walk me to my car? Come in. Pam, I hate to break this to you, but Dwight can't stop you from being mugged. He's just not tough enough. He's a purple belt, that's really high. Oh, God, I could beat up Dwight. That's ridiculous. I can murder him. It's just that out there you Oh, is that what they're saying? Yeah, kind of. Okay, all right. Where's Dwight? JIM: Kitchen. Okay. DWIGHT: All right. Here we go. (KELLY EXCLAIMS) Good. Wow, that's actually pretty cool, Dwight. Excellent. Now, watch. Let me take you from behind. What? MICHAEL: Watch out, Kelly, he might sucker punch you. I didn't sucker punch you, Michael. No, really? In case you'd remember, I was defending my honor. Oh, is that it? Like a samurai. Yeah. Really? Well, the offer, Dwight, was for one punch, which I absorbed. I had no idea that there would be a second punch. So, catch-22. DWIGHT: Okay, fine. Tit for tit. Give it your best shot. Two punches. Go! Look, if we were in a bar right now, there would be two punches. Me punching you and you hitting the floor. No, I'd block your first punch Yeah? rendering you ineffective. Oh, really? Yeah. You know what, you're just lucky that we're at work right now. What about, uh, Dwight's dojo? No, they just have classes. No, it's free during the day. It's fine. Look I got the key. Hey, Michael. Hey, Toby. Any word on those time cards? I have an idea. Why don't you leave right now? Why don't you walk away from the room, okay? Fine. We'll go at lunch. Pam, make an announcement. Figure out car pools. JIM: Well, we're all getting excited to see this fight. The Albany branch is working right through lunch to prevent downsizing, but Michael, he decided to extend our lunch by an hour so that we could all go down to the dojo and watch him fight Dwight. Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! I'm coming. Fight! Sorry. I recognize that. That is Japanese for California Roll. No, it's not. I think it is, a guy told me about that. Actually it's a symbol for eternal discipline. Oh. Wow. That is really interesting. What? Your love line I'm just kidding. I can't see anything. Look closer. Oh, okay. One point for me. Tied up. Oh, you're dead. What? What are you gonna do? Bring it, Beesley, bring it. (GRUNTS) Oh, yeah. Good move. Not such an ultimate fighter now, huh? (LAUGHING) Hey, put me down. Put me down! Oh, my God! Hey, put me down! Hey! IRA: Okay, gentlemen, listen up. After a clean strike to the chest, stomach or kidneys, I will separate you and award a point. The first person to three wins, all right? Yes, Sensei. Lot of rules, lot of rules. On the street, we didn't have any rules. Maybe one. No kicks to the groin, home for dinner. (EXCLAIMS) Hey, what the hell was that? Yes! IRA: Dwight, one point. No way! Okay! Eat it! All right, that's the way you wanna do it? You wanna play dirty, huh? Okay, game on, man! Sweep the leg. MICHAEL: Yeah, I'm coming at you, man! (BREATHING QUICKLY) (MICHAEL EXCLAIMS) Okay, purple belt, okay. I got it. No. I got his pants. That was my pants. No points for pants. Dwight, you have No, look. No, you have something, you have some God, you look like such an idiot! (BOTH SHOUTING) Clean technique, gentlemen. Come on, do that again! Do that again, I dare you. (SCREAMING) Okay, break. Break! No holding! Break. Oh, you can't see! You can't see! One point, two points, three points! IRA: Break! How many points was that? I win! I win! No, you didn't! No, you Eight points, nine points. (HAWKING) Stop it! No! Come on, Michael! Open your mouth! No, Michael! You talking to me? You talking to me? Raging Bull. Pacino. Oh, I want that footage, I want it. I need it. Oh, I have to get back to work. I have lots of work to Check this out. Come here. There he is. Mr. Temp having lunch by the car. Let us play with him. This is going to be hilarious. Oh, we're playing phone tag. WOMAN ON PHONE: Seven new messages. First new message. ; MICHAEL: Hi, Ryan. This is Saddam Hussein. Next message. ; Hey, Ryan, this is your girlfriend and I'm mad. My emergency contact is Todd Packer. Todd F. Packer. Know what the "F" stands for? Fudge? (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Yeah. Come in. Oh, hey, Karate Kid. The Hilary Swank version. Hi. How are you? I need to change my emergency contact information from Michael Scott. Okay, to what? Just put "The Hospital." Contact number, just put 911. (SCRATCHING) He is such a sore loser. You heard, obviously, that I mopped the floor with him this afternoon. You know what, do yourself a favor. Just leave me as his contact and I will call the hospital. Cut out the middleman. (SCRATCHING) Later, Jim. Later, Kev. Have a good weekend. Yeah, you, too. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Yeah? I have the emergency contacts. Just lay them on a chair. I'll take it from here. So, what you up to this weekend? Hanging out with some friends, probably. Well, if you do anything crazy, give me a shout. Yeah. All right, I will see you Monday. All right. Bye. (SIGHING) Dwight? Michael, did you finish yet? This close. Dwight, may I speak with you for a minute? I'm busy. Well, busier, but I'm making the time. Michael, can't your conversation wait till Monday? We wanna go home. Well, you don't even have anybody to go home to, Toby, so The shipping place closes in a half hour. I know, but I have been carrying the load on my back all day. And if everyone would just chip in a little bit, it might help me out. What do you say? Let's gang-bang this thing and go home. Good? Dwight. This is illegal. I don't care. I have been testing you the entire day. Did you know that? Of course. And I'm happy to say that you passed. So, effective immediately, I am promoting you from Assistant to the Regional Manager, to Assistant Regional Manager. Michael, I don't know I know, I know, I know, I know. I wouldn't be offering it if I didn't think you could handle it. I can handle it. I can. I know. Okay. (SIGHS) So, I guess, this will just be my office. No, no, title change only. I'll have Pam send out a memo. No, no. Three month probationary period. Let's just not tell anybody about this right now. Just a formality. Absolutely. But not really. Michael, I have so much to learn from you. Yes, you do. Thank you, Sensei. And, ditto. I told Dwight that there is honor in losing, which, as we all know, is completely ridiculous. But there is, however, honor in making a loser feel better, which is what I just did for Dwight. Would I rather be feared or loved? Easy. Both. I want people to be afraid of how much they love me, and I think I proved that today at the dojo. Typewriter torture! Sensei! Typewriter torture! Stop! Typewriter!   Hey, have they left for the big meeting yet? I got Michael's lucky tie. No, they're in the conference room. Okay. Wait. Are those Michael's Levi's? Yeah. Who dry-cleans jeans? PAM: Michael and his jeans. He gets in them, and I'm not exactly sure what happens, but I can tell you he loves the way he looks in those jeans. I know that's why he started Casual Fridays. I'll take those. Thanks. This is a projection of the county's needs. Wow. Graphs and charts. So Somebody's really been doing their homework. Looks like USA Today. Thirteen schools, two hospitals JIM: So, this possible client they're talking about, actually a big deal. It's Lackawanna County, our whole county. And if we get this, they might not have to downsize our branch. And I could work here for years. And years. And years. So when we get to the Radisson, I would like to Oh, I changed it to Chili's. Excuse me? Radisson, it just gives out this vibe. It's like, "Oh, I'm doing business at the Radisson." It's kind of snooty. So You had no right to do that, Michael. Here's the thing. "Chili's is the new golf course. "It's where business happens." Small Businessman Magazine. It said that? It will. I sent it in. Letter to the editor. All right. But you will let me run this meeting. (MUMBLING IN AGREEMENT) Power trip. What? She had done a background check on me. She had it printed out. No. Yeah. And she was asking me about stuff, line by line, while we were having dinner. RYAN: That is unbelievable. What's going on? We are doing worst first dates. Oh, my God, I win. Okay, it was a minor league hockey game, he brought his brother, and when I went to the bathroom, the game ended and they forgot about me. Okay, that's a joke. No, they had to come back for me. Wait, when was this? Um It was not that long ago. Wait, not Roy. Say it's not your fiance. I always knew Pam has refused to go to sports games with Roy, but I never knew why. Interesting. Okay, let's do this thing. Wish us luck. Good luck, Michael. Good luck, Jan. Thank you. Kiss ass. Okay, probably going to go late tonight, burning the midnight tequila. So, I think you all could just take off now. Michael, this shouldn't take more than an hour. Well Do you always shut down the entire office when you leave for an hour? No, no. That would not be efficient. Actually, they just don't get very much work done when I'm not here. That's not true, I know how to delegate. And they do more work when I'm not here. Not more. The same amount of work is done, whether I'm here or not. Hey, everybody, listen up! This is what we're gonna do. You sit tight until I return. Sound good? Doesn't matter, it's an order. Follow it blindly. Okay. All right, ciao. Adios! So which way is Chili's? I'll drive. No, that's all right. I wanna leave straight from there. It is just a couple blocks away, so Boy, you really don't know Scranton, do you? I know Scranton. At all! All right Have you ever been to Scranton, Jan? (SINGING) If it's a couple of blocks away, we can go together. Okay. MICHAEL: Jan Levinson-Gould. Jan is cold. If she was sitting across from you on a train and she wasn't moving, you might think she was dead. We should come up with a signal of some sort. Why would we need a signal? Well, in case one of us gets into trouble, the other one can signal What kind of trouble are you planning on getting in, Michael? Well, it could be either of us. You're gonna let me do the talking, we agreed on that. Yes. MICHAEL: Hello? Christian? Yes. I thought that was you. Hi. Hi. Michael Scott. This is Jan Levinson-Gould. Just "Jan Levinson." And No Gould? No. Thank you very much for meeting with us. Have you been waiting long? No, not long. Good. Good. Jan, what happened? Michael. Is Gould dead? What Michael, we got divorced, okay? I'm so sorry, excuse me. Wow, you're kidding me. Do you want to talk about it? Michael. Could we have a table for three, please? When did this happen? We're in a meeting. Okay. WAITRESS: This way, please. Christian. All right, after you. Thank you. I thought we could start by going over the needs of the county. Right. Well, Lackawanna County has not been immune to the slow economic growth over the past five years. So for us, the name of the game is budget reduction and Awesome Blossom? What? I think we should share an Awesome Blossom. What do you say? They are awesome. You want to, Christian? Blossom? Sure. Okay, it's done. Actually, Megan? May we have an Awesome Blossom, please? Extra awesome. Now it is done. So, if you have a Hey, I heard a very, very funny joke the other day. You wanna hear it? Christian, you don't have to listen to this. We can It's okay, I like jokes. Okay. Just the one. Just one joke? Okay. Well, if it's just going to be one, I will think of a different joke. Um Let's see. Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Pam, it's Michael. I need you to go into my office and check some data for me. Okay, you want me to read them? Yes. Okay. "A fisherman is walking down Fifth Avenue, "leading an animal behind him when" No, no. Told it, not as good as you think. Pick another one. Okay. "There's a transcript between a naval ship" Okay! Bingo! And a lighthouse. Yes. That is hysterical. Could you start that one from the beginning? Sure. "There's a transcript between a naval ship and a lighthouse" (CLOSING DRAWER) Is this real? It is a screenplay starring himself. Agent Michael Scarn. Of the FBI. How long is this? Oh, Pam! Good work! Oh, wait, stop. Drawings. PAM: What is that? Oh, those are drawings. In case the writing didn't really put a picture in your head. And there he is, in the flesh, Agent Michael Scarn. Now we know what he looks like. The first guy says, "Well, I'm an astronaut, so I drive a Saturn." And the second guy says, "Well, I am a pimp, so I drive a cheap Escort." And the third guy says, "I got you both beat. "I'm a proctologist, so I drive a brown Probe." Oh, no! No! Oh, my God, that's funny! I almost had Awesome Blossom coming out of my nose! Excuse me, could I have a vodka tonic, please? JIM: Do we all have our copy of Threat Level Midnight by Michael Scott? Yeah. Oh, yeah. All right, let's get this started. I'm gonna be reading the action descriptions and, Phyllis, I would like you to play Catherine Zeta-Jones. That's the character's name? Oh, yeah. You guys should not be doing this. Why not, Dwight? This is a movie. I mean, this is for all of America to enjoy. You took something that doesn't belong to you Dwight. brought it in here and made copies of it. Do you want to play the lead role of Agent Michael Scarn? (MICHAEL MIMICKING HUNGRY MONSTER) Hey, that's delicious. I love it. We would probably be upset with ourselves if we went this whole night without talking business, so Dunder Mifflin can provide a level of personal service to the county that the warehouse chains just can't match. Well, we are out to save money. What's the bottom line? (GIBBERING NONSENSICALLY) That's why I wanted a signal between us, so I wouldn't have to just shout nonsense words. That's her fault. Did somebody say, "baby back ribs"? Hmm? Hmm? I don't think Christian has time for that I have time. (MICHAEL TAPPING SPOON RHYTHMICALLY) (SINGING) I want my baby back, baby back, baby back I want my baby back, baby back, baby back I want my baby-back, baby-back, baby-back Chili's baby-back ribs I want my baby-back, baby-back "Inside the FBI, Agent Michael Scarn sits with his feet up on his desk. "Catherine Zeta-Jones enters." "Sir, you have some messages." "Not now!" "They're important." "Okay, what are they?" "The first message is, 'I love you.' That's from me." "Not in a thousand years, Catherine, we work together. "And get off my desk." Yes, I have acted before. I was in a production of Oklahoma! In the seventh grade. I played the part of Mutie the Mailman. They had too many kids, so they made up roles like that. I was good. "If it isn't my old partner, Samuel L. Chang." "Agent Michael Scarn, you lost some weight." DWIGHT: "Thank you for noticing. "Now, keep me company for one more mission." (WHISPERING) Hey, I have to work late. RYAN: "But as soon as I blow out these candles" You're joking, right? JIM: Michael Scarn takes out a 9mm gun and shoots the cake. (IMITATING GUN FIRING) (RYAN LAUGHING) "Agent Michael Scarn, you so funny. Word." Michael's movie? Two thumbs down. "A man, sitting several seats down, who has a gold face, "turns to Michael Scarn." (EXCLAIMS) Oscar? Do you want to play "Golden Face"? (CLEARING THROAT) "Mr. Scarn, perhaps you would be more comfortable in my private jet." "Yes, perhaps I would, Golden Face. Sam, get my luggage." "I forget it, brother." "Samuel, you are such an idiot. "You are the worst assistant ever and you're disgusting." "Dwigt." Wait, who's Dwigt? PAM: Here's what we think happened. Michael's sidekick, who all through the movie, is this complete idiot who's causing the downfall of the United States, was originally named Dwight, but then Michael changed it to Samuel L. Chang using a search and replace. But that doesn't work on misspelled words, leaving behind one "Dwigt." And Dwight figured it out. Oops! D-W-l-G-H-T. Okay, you know what? I am done with this. That's it. The end. JIM: Well, some of us wanna keep reading, if you don't You don't speak for everyone, Jim. Okay, announcement. My uncle bought me some fireworks. And anyone who wants to see a real show, come with me outside now. JIM: That's actually a good idea. We'll all take a brief intermission. Hey, are you hungry? Yeah. Yeah? And so, after watching my mom go through so much pain, I decided to keep that promise that I made to her, and take care of her. (EXCLAIMING) Well, this brings us to Jan. Truth or dare. Tell us about your divorce. Oh, no! Michael. Michael. Do. Michael. Michael, please. No. Do, right? Really. It's Hey, you say you're not gonna play. She's not playing. She's not playing the game. It isn't fair. We'd been fighting for a while. Check, please. He didn't want kids. I knew that going into it, but he also knew that I did. So I guess I thought that he would change his mind, he thought that I would change mine. You didn't? I was stupid. No, no, you were not stupid. Gould was stupid, right? That's right. You know? You were really brave. I mean, you put your arms out there, you slit your wrists. That's true. You said, "World, this is my blood, it's red, just like yours. "So love me." JIM: I had plans to meet a friend tonight, which I had to cancel. But this is cool, too. I'm not a complainer. Wow. For the bugs. Nice. And that's excellent because bugs love my famous grilled cheese sandwich. Yes. Nice. I can't remember the last time someone made me dinner. (WHOOPING) Yeah! Yes! Right down the street? Kenneth Road, born and raised. Spent my whole life right here in Lackawanna County and I do not intend on moving. I know this place. I know how many hospitals we have. I know how many schools we have. It's home, you know? I know the challenges that this county is up against. Here's the thing about those discount suppliers, they don't care. They come in, they undercut everything, and they run us out of business. And then, once we're all gone, they jack up the prices. I know. It's bad. It's terrible. It is. You know what? It really is. (SHUSHING) I don't know. I guess I could give you guys our business, but you have to meet me halfway, okay, because they're expecting me to make cuts. Well, corporate's gonna go ballistic, but you think we could, Jan? So I guess I'll see you in What are you gonna do with your time off? Travel. Yeah. I've been looking forward to it. It's gonna be really nice. I'm gonna find myself. You have new music? Yeah. Definitely. (MELODIC INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING) See you! Bye! Thanks. Yes! We did it. We got it! I mean, we got it! We nailed it! Nailed it! Come here. Yes! I am really thrilled. Let's go. What? Let's go. Going Okay. Where're we going? Doesn't matter. Going to the go-go. (LAUGHING) Okay. Michael? Michael? Michael? His car's not in the parking lot. I should check the accident reports. Who's this? Jan. (BEEPING) Good morning, Pam. Hey. No, nothing happened. I swear. Nothing happened. What? I'm totally being serious. A gentleman does not kiss and tell. And neither do I. No, seriously, guys, I'm not (STUTTERING) I don't want to go into it at all. It's off-limits. Fine. I took her back to her hotel and we made out for a little while. It was great. I mean, she told me about her divorce, we talked for about five hours, she fell asleep on my arm, so Hello, Dwight. Did you do her? Who? Jan Levinson-Gould. No, no. No Gould. Did you do her? This is none of your affair. Because she is your boss And she is your boss. And she is a woman. She is a strong, soft, thoughtful, sexy woman. And you know what? I don't think I can sit here and let you talk about her that way without me defending her honor. Jan, I defend your honor. Is that all? (WHISPERING) Jan didn't come back for her car last night. (WHISPERING) What? Could it be that Agent Michael Scarn has finally found his Catherine Zeta? Oh, I don't know. (PHONE RINGING) Oh, my God. This is Jan's cell. No way. Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. I know we have to register as a consensual sexual relationship with HR. My question, do I do it as the man? Does she do it as my superior? I don't know. That leads to other issues that we may have in our relationship. (PHONE RINGING) It's Excuse me. Hello? Hi. Just talking about you. To the camera? No. Uh-huh. How's traffic? I miss you. What? Okay. Well, if it was a mistake, it was a wonderful mistake. No. Could you just No, I did not intentionally get you drunk. Mmm-hmm. No, no. This is just a fight. This is just the first of many fights we're going to have. Right. No! See, you I don't understand. You want to see other people? Only other people? Why? Okay, I think you're still a little bit drunk. Excuse me. Excuse me? I think you're Yes, why don't you just come back here? We can go to the hotel, have a few drinks. No, I didn't slip you something. Some might even say we had our first date last night. Oh, really? Really. Why might some say that? 'Cause there was dinner by candlelight. Mmm-hmm. Dinner and a show, if you include Michael's movie. And there was dancing and fireworks. Pretty good date. We didn't dance. You're right. We didn't dance. It was more like swaying. But it's still romantic. Swaying isn't dancing. At least I didn't leave you at a high school hockey game. I have some faxes to get out. Oh, come on, Pam. I JIM: Okay, we didn't dance. And I was totally joking, anyway. I mean It's not really a date if the girl goes home to her fiance. Right?   You should get one of these. No, thank you. Do you even know what this is? It is a fitness orb and it has completely changed my life. Forget everything you thought you knew about ab workouts. Done. This ab workout is specifically designed to strengthen your core. Sorry. It's all right. Numerous health benefits, strengthens your back, better performance in sports, more enjoyable sex. You're not having sex. Plus, improves your reflexes. See, I would have caught that. Okay, you know what, how much is that? It's only 25 bucks. Wow. Okay. (HISSING) Pam, can I see you in my office? PAM: It's performance review day, company-wide. Last year, my performance review started with Michael asking me what my hopes and dreams were and it ended with him telling me he could bench press 190 pounds. So, I don't really know what to expect. Pam, you're trustworthy. Thank you. And a woman. Oh, no. And I want you to listen to a voicemail from my boss. (BEEPING) JAN: Michael, it's Jan. I guess I missed you. I'll be there this afternoon for performance reviews. I hope it's understood that that will be our only topic of discussion. See you soon. First impressions? Just off the top, I think she'll be here this afternoon. MICHAEL: My boss is coming in today. The lovely Jan Levinson-Gould. Well, no Gould, the Gould has been Divorce. The awkward part is that this is the first time we'll be seeing each other since Well MICHAEL: It was really nothing. We just sort of got caught up in the moment. The vulnerable divorcee gives herself to the "understanding with rugged good looks" office manager. Just, she didn't want it to continue for some reason. We both didn't. I didn't want it. We both didn't want it to continue. It was not professional. When people say something's mutual, it never is. But this was mutual. JAN: I guess I missed you. "I guess I missed you." So she misses me? She missed you. But then she goes on to say, "That will be our only topic of discussion." That doesn't mean anything. Those are just words. I have one idea of what it means. Okay, yeah. What? What? Well, I don't think you're gonna be very happy with this. Oh, great. All right, well, now I'm in a terrible mood. Let's do your performance review. Because she's conflicted. She has to be professional, but she's fighting feelings for you. Why That's great news. That Why would I not like that? Just 'cause that you work together and it might be awkward. Wow, wow. All right, let's listen to that again. JAN: Michael, it's Jan. I guess I missed you. Oh, hey. Listen, Jim, here's a little tip for your performance review. Okay. Tell Michael that we should be stocking more of the double-tabbed manila file folders. We don't have double-tabbed manila file folders. Oh, yes, we do. No, we don't. Yeah, it's a new product. So, you should just suggest that to him and then he'll be sure to give you a raise. All right. Well, I'm not asking for a raise. I'm gonna actually be asking for a pay decrease. That is so stupid. What if he gives it to you? Then I win. You know what? I am going to zone you out for the rest of today. Okay. I need to stay focused. And I don't have to see you tomorrow or Sunday, and please don't call me, and we'll see how things go Monday. (SIGHING) Stupid. Wait, wait, one thing. By tomorrow, you mean Saturday, right? Duh! Duh. Today is Thursday, but Dwight thinks that it's Friday. And that's what I'll be working on this afternoon. Sometimes women say more in their pauses than they say in their words. Really? Oh, yes. Let's listen to it again, and this time, really listen to the pauses. God, Stanley. That's freaking brilliant. How do you know that? Did you learn that on the streets? I'm sorry. Oh, it's okay. I did learn it on the streets. On the ghetto, in fact. No kidding. It's all about my bonus. Michael and Jan definitely made out. Oh! Maybe more. Oh, also it is Thursday, but Dwight thinks it's Friday. So, keep that going. Oh, yay! Good work, Stanley. Great performance review! Stanley in the house, everybody! (WHOOPING) Angela, your turn. ANGELA: I actually look forward to performance reviews. I did the youth beauty pageant circuit and I enjoyed that quite a bit. I really enjoy being judged. I believe I hold up very well to even severe scrutiny. Michael? Yeah? Jan's on the phone for you. Angela, you were totally satisfactory this year. Interesting. Jan is calling me. Maybe it wasn't so mutual after all. Yeah? JAN: Michael Jan! Hello. To what do I owe this pleasure? I'm returning your many calls. Well, hello to you, too. Yeah, I was just I just wanted to get some closure on what transpired between us at the meeting we had in the parking lot of the Chili's. No. No, we won't be discussing that, Michael. The only things I wanna talk about during your performance review are your concrete ideas to improve your branch. Well, surely, this review is a formality because of what happened at our meeting in the parking lot of the Chili's. The review is anything but a formality, Michael. And I expect you to forget anything that you think may have happened between us and exhibit completely professional behavior. Been thinking about you. Okay, that is an example of completely unprofessional behavior. I don't see how that's unprofessional. Michael? Yeah? Are the cameras in there with you, in your office? No. They are not. Yes, they are. (PHONE CLICKING) (DIAL TONE) That's my girlfriend. I heard they made out and had sex. I heard they just made out. That's it. Well, I heard they made out and had sex. Don't talk about it. Office romances are nobody's business but the people involved. Romances? Pam, I have ideas on a daily basis, I know I do. I have a clear memory of telling people my ideas. Is there any chance that you wrote any of my ideas down in a folder, like an idea folder? Sorry. That's unfortunate. How about the suggestion box? There's tons of ideas in there. What suggestion box? The suggestion box that I put out. And people could put in suggestions anonymously. Maybe there's prizes. Oh, yeah, I think I remember that from back when I first started. Why don't you find it and then tell people to get their No, never mind. I'll tell them. Hello? Everybody? Yeah, attention, please. Jan Levinson's coming very soon and so we're gonna have our weekly suggestion box meeting. So you can all get in your constructive compliments ASAP. Don't you mean constructive criticism? What did I say? You said constructive compliments. That doesn't make any sense. Well, Kelly, that was neither constructive nor a compliment, so maybe you should stop criticizing my English and start making some suggestions, okay? Hey, Dan, this is Jim. It is about 11:15 and I wanted to know what you were up to tomorrow, which is the 15th, and that is a Saturday. Saturday. So just let me know what you're doing tomorrow, Saturday, for lunch. Okay, talk to you soon. JAN: Address this when we meet again. Okay. Okay, bye-bye. Would you please tell Michael that I'm here? PAM: Sure. Hi, Jan. How are you? Hi, Michael. I'm good. How are you? Good to see you. Nice to see you. Okay. Okay, why don't we just step into my office? We're gonna go in here. Could we please go into your office? Yeah, right after you. Apres vous. (WHISPERING) No calls. I'll get that. Oh, thank you. It's nice to see you. Nice to see you, too, Michael. Really? Not like that. Oh, well You know, Michael, I think I need to make something clear right off the top. I'm not going to discuss anything with you other than Dunder Mifflin business. All right. Period. Do we understand each other? Absolutely. I'm a little confused because first it's, like, all kissy-kissy and then it's, like, all regret because, "Oh, I regret that. "But, wait, I'm still gonna call you. "But we're just gonna talk business, "and I may come down there and fire you if you don't do your job." But what were we talking about when we first kissed? Business. So, are you still in the middle of the performance reviews then? No, no, no. I finished all that. I'm very fast. I'm not too fast. Not like, "Wham, bam, thank you, ma'am." But I do say, "Thank you, ma'am." But I'm not like, "Wham bam." Not that there's anything wrong with "wham bam," if it's consensual. We're talking about office stuff. Can I ask you a question? No. This is a business question. It's nothing personal, I promise. Fine. Are you wearing a new perfume today? How is that a business question? Well, you're wearing it at the office, and It I'm sorry, no offense, but it's really sexy. Please don't smell me, Michael. Hey, Jim. Hey. How's it going? Oh, my God, did you see The Apprentice last night? Of course. It's on every Thursday night, so how could I miss it? Can you believe who Trump fired? No, that was unbelievable. Who? Who was it? Who did he fire? You didn't see it? No. I went out and got drunk with my laser tag team last night. Crap! Never go out on a Thursday night. What the hell was I thinking? I don't understand (TELEPHONE RINGING) Hold on. Sorry. Yes, Pam. PAM: Michael, it's time for the suggestion box meeting. I'm kind of in the middle of something. I wish you wouldn't interrupt. You told me to buzz you about the suggestion box meeting when Jan was here. I did not, not, not use those words. I'd like to sit in on that meeting. Is it happening right now? No, it's in, like, Everyone's waiting in the conference room. Great. Very good. MICHAEL: Why are we here? Because I value your opinions. Now, I know a lot of you don't think that I read your suggestions, but I do. I just sift through them every week and I really look and scrutinize to see what you guys are writing. So, let's just read some of these suckers, okay? All right. Number one. "What should we do to prepare for Y2K?" "What should we do to prepare for Y2K?" I thought you read these every week? Well, obviously, this one got stuck in the box. That happens occasionally. DWIGHT: It happens occasionally. And, so One down! Next suggestion. "We need better outreach for employees fighting depression." Okay. All right, enough with the jokes. Nobody in here is suffering from depression. That sounds serious, Michael. Oh, okay. Well, yeah? Who wrote it? Tom? Tom. Then, it is a joke because there's nobody in here named Tom. Tom? He worked in accounting up until about a year ago. Tom. Oh, that guy? That guy was weird. All right, next suggestion. Next suggestion. (MICHAEL GIBBERING) "You need to do something about your B.O." "You need to do something about your B.O." Okay. Now, I don't know who this suggestion is meant for, but it's more of a personal suggestion. And it's not an office suggestion. Far be it from me to use this as a platform to embarrass anybody. Aren't the suggestions meant for you? Well, Toby, if by me you are inferring that I have B.O., then I would say that that is a very poor choice of words. Michael, he wasn't inferring, he was implying. You were inferring. Was I, Creed? Okay, well, you know what I am implying is that when we're on an elevator together, I should maybe take the stairs. Because talk about stank. Not that I would ever say something like that in public, and I never have, and I never will. I just think it's something that we should all be aware of, okay? Now that we've learned this, let's continue. See, this is good. We're learning and we're figuring some stuff out. "You need to do something about your coffee breath." Okay, no! "You need to do something" Shut up, shut up, shut up, Dwight. Okay. I don't think you people are grasping the concept of the suggestion box. Sometimes you talk to us real close. Yeah? Is that hard for you? All right. Well Well, when you have coffee breath it's hard I'll work on that. Okay, let's keep going. DWIGHT: Just keep it going. Yup. What do we have here? We have somebody's piece of gum. Somebody put a piece of gum in there. This is not a garbage can. This is the future of our company. This is not a place for gum, okay? I don't want to have to read these tomorrow. Yeah. Who wants to come in on a Saturday? Yeah What? All right. Next suggestion. "Next suggestion." "Don't" Okay, that's blank. Don't Just Put it "Don't sleep with your boss." Do you think this is referring to you boning Jan? I can't I don't understand why you're so upset. I can't All right, please sit down. I'm going to sit over here, you're gonna sit over there. Why are you Let me ask you this. Please sit yourself down. Let me ask you something. What, Michael? Where did you get your outfit? (HARD ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ON CD PLAYER) You're gonna give me this raise. I deserve this raise. Yes! Yes! Yes! (SCREAMING) The least you can do is keep my salary consistent with inflation. (SHOUTING) Yes! Why are you gonna give me this raise? Why? Because I'm awesome! I am awesome! I just don't understand why you have to pretend like nothing happened. Because nothing did, Michael. I'm not gonna say anything more about it and I would advise that you do the same. Look Michael. Oh, my God. I'm sorry. I'm interrupting. Oh, God. Were you guys making out? No, Dwight. Come in. Great. What do you want, Dwight? I am ready for my performance review. Okay, great. Your performance has been adequate. You may leave. Goodbye. Is this how you've been conducting all the reviews, Michael? Do you want to talk now? Good. Okay, Dwight, leave. Wait, I would like to discuss my raise. Why on earth would we give you a raise? That is an excellent question. Thank you for asking it. Let me bring up one word. Dedication. I have never been late. Also, I have never missed a day due to illness, even when I had walking pneumonia. I even come in on holidays. You do? How do you get in? I have a copy of your key. That's a serious offense. That is a serious offense. Very serious. As is toying with a man's heart. Oh, Michael, for God's sakes. I'd also further like to talk about my merits in the workplace. Okay, third wheel, why don't you do that? For instance, the time I brought in deer jerky for the whole office. That was deer? Gross. Oh, God! DWIGHT: You liked it. Did not. Jan, have you ever had deer? No. It's a delicacy. And, you know what? It's an aphrodisiac. So when we're done here, you guys could go over to the Antler Lodge, sample some deer, and talk about my raise. What do you say, Jan? Okay, here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna step outside, collect my thoughts, and I will return in about 10 minutes. Okay, you just clear your head. Thank you, Dwight. Look, I know it's your job, I know you have to ask, but I promise you I'm not gonna discuss it with him, I'm certainly not gonna discuss it with you. Do you have a light? And in conclusion, I think Lex Luther said it best when he said, "Dad, you have no idea "what I'm capable of." That's from Superman? Smallville. And that is why I feel I deserve this raise. PAM: Do you think Michael and Jan actually I don't really wanna picture it. But thank you, Pam. How do you come back from that? You don't, I don't think, come all the way back, you know. Especially working together. No, I mean doing that with Michael. How do you come back from that as a human being? Yeah. No, I don't think you can. I'm heading back to New York. Alan and I will conduct your performance review over the phone tomorrow. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Okay? Good. No, no, no, come I just want to know why. Michael, now is not the time or the place. Okay, so you're saying that there is a different time or place that we could have this discussion? No. I am saying we are never gonna have this conversation. Well, okay. What? Never? As in never, ever, ever? Or never as in there's still a chance? Never for me always means never, ever, ever. I just want to know, from the horse's mouth, what is the dealio? You know, Michael Am I too short? Michael, it has nothing to do with your looks, okay? It's your personality. I mean, you're obnoxious, and rude, and stupid, and you do have coffee breath, by the way. And I don't agree about the B.O., but you are very, very inconsiderate. Really? Really. You're You're a great guy, okay? I appreciate that, thank you. And you were very sweet. And you stayed up with me and talked to me and cried with me, and I appreciate that. No, I didn't. I was I don't cry. But I just am not in a place right now where I'm looking for a relationship. So, we can still work together, we can still be friends, but (ELEVATOR BELL DINGING) Okay? So my looks have nothing to do with it? Oh, God. Jan is not in a place where she feels she can have a relationship right now, and it doesn't matter how great a guy I am. And that is all I needed. I'm good. I can go home now. (PHONE RINGING) Hey, it's 12:20. Where the hell's Dwight? No idea. "Never missed a day," my ass. I'm here! I'm here! I'm here. It's okay!   It is Friday morning and it is another beautiful day in Scranton, Pennsylvania. (GASPS) Oh, my God! Pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up. We have a serious problem here. All right everybody, lock the doors, turn off the lights. Pretend you're not here. Are we in danger? There's no time to think about it, this is real. Just Everybody (KNOCKING ON DOOR) KEVIN: Michael, should I call the What? The IT tech guy and me did not get off to a great start. Yeah, I tried to install it myself, but you guys have these things so password protected That just means you have to enter your password. What's your password, Michael? Uh That's Yes. (YELLING) Michael Sorry. Please don't do that. Okay, I'm sorry. What is going on in there? Why is he here? What are you doing? I can't tell you. You have to tell me. I don't have to tell you anything. Look, Michael, (SIGHING) I know you don't want to have to think about this, but if something were to happen to you, God forbid, then I would need to know in order to take over. Dwight, nothing is going to happen to me, okay? I'm in the best shape of my life. Look at this. Yeah, but that doesn't matter, you could get a brain aneurysm I'm not going to get or hit by a car Stop. or a bus or a train. You could get poisoned, fall down a well, step on a mine, choke. I'm not Okay, if I step on a mine in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and die, you can have my job, okay? Why don't you just go away? There are certain things a boss does not share with his employees. His salary, that would depress them. His bed. And I am not going to tell them that I'll be reading their e-mails. So how do you search? By keyword phrase. Try "profits." No, try "Michael Scott." "Michael," "boss" and "funny." Oh, my God. Wow! E-mail from Stanley. Stanley, terribly nice guy. "Sorry I didn't write back sooner. "I can't go to the game tonight because my boss, Michael, "is an ass and making me stay late." Well, Stanley's an ass. Not one of our harder workers. Hey, what's the deal, Michael? Why are you spying on our computers? Oh, no! Everybody, Oscar's gone crazy. What other ghost stories do you have for us? That I'm a robot? I will destroy everything in my path. OSCAR: Actually, we just (MIMICKING ROBOTIC SOUNDS) Actually Okay. Oil can. Oil can. Tin Man. Actually, we just got a memo from IT saying you're doing e-mail surveillance. What? No, that defeats the whole purpose. So it's true? You have access to our e-mails? You know what the problem is? I think I do. The problem is that when people hear the term "Big Brother," they immediately think it's scary or bad. But I don't. I think, "Wow, I love my big brother." I gotta erase a lot of stuff. A lot of stuff. Oh, hey. Just so you know, if you have any sensitive e-mails, they need to be deleted immediately. I know. Good. Hey! Something just happened. Dwight just told Angela that she has to delete all of her sensitive e-mails immediately. What? I know. Do you think that they're, like No. Right. No, no. (HUMMING) (EXCLAIMING DISGUSTEDLY) Maybe. It's like squishing a spider under a book. It's going to be really gross, but I have to look and make sure that it's really dead. So if you guys see anything Hey, Dwight? My friend is kind of into these two girls that he works with. Nice. One is tall and brunette, and the other one is short and blond and perky and kind of judgmental. Who do you think he should choose? Does he have access to their medical records? Um I think one of the greatest things about modern America is the computerization of medical records. As a volunteer sheriff, I can look up anyone's psychiatric records or surgical histories. Yeast infections. There are a huge number of yeast infections in this county. Probably because we're downriver from that old bread factory. MICHAEL: Meredith has an evite from Jim. Barbeque at Jim's tonight. Tonight? Wonder where my evitation is. Click on guest list. Angela, Stanley, Oscar, Meredith, Phyllis, Kevin, Creed. Must be No. Hey, Angela. How's it going? Hey. It's okay. Listen, are you bringing anyone to Jim's party tonight? No. Are we supposed to? No. I mean, I don't know. I don't think so. Excuse me. There is always a distance between a boss and the employees. It is just nature's rule. It's intimidation mostly. It's the awareness that they are not me. I do think that I'm very approachable as one of the guys. But maybe I need to be even approachabler. (CHATTERING) Are you going to eat with us? Of course. Hanging with my crew, crew that I am one of. Hanging with my cup of noodles. This is a meal in a cup. Right here. Hot, tasty. Reminds me of college. Lived on this stuff. Brain food. (GRUNTING APPRECIATIVELY) You know what I really, really miss about college? The parties. Everybody would go, the athletes, the nerds, professors. The professors would go to the parties? Yeah. They were the most fun. We always invited them. JIM: It's true, I'm having a party. I've got three cases of imported beer, karaoke machine and I didn't invite Michael. So, three ingredients for a great party. And it's nothing personal. I just think that if he were there, people wouldn't be able to relax, you know, have fun. And my roommate wants to meet everybody. Because, I'm pretty sure he thinks I'm making Dwight up. He is very real. What? Oh, yes! Thank you. Question. On the Internet, there are several different options to get to your house for the party tonight, and I was wondering Could you keep that down? Why? (WHISPERING) Because not everybody knows about the party. (WHISPERING) Like who? Who doesn't know? Michael. Why just Michael? Because it's a surprise. Is it? Oh, that's perfect. So don't tell. I won't. Okay. So, Dwight thinks that tonight is a surprise party for Michael. Really? That's great. I know. Maybe we can get him to hide and wait somewhere. Oh, man. Oh, you know, speaking of which, I was just trying to get a handle on numbers for food and stuff, so do you think Roy's gonna come, or Oh, no, he can't make it. Okay, cool. Hey, there. Hey. Almost quitting time. Yep, it's 4:00. One more hour to take care of anything you forgot to do. (CLEARING THROAT) Hey, you know, I don't know if you have any plans tonight, but if you don't, we could hang out. Oh, um I can't. You have plans? Yeah, I do. Yeah? I do, too. I do, too. You do? Big plans. I do. Yeah. Because you just said you wanted Tonight? I can't do it tonight, no. Improv class. I have improv class. Hanging out with my improv buds. Really? Yeah. That sounds like a lot of fun. Oh, it's the best. It is the best. I would not miss it for the world. But if something else came up, I would definitely not go. Improv sounds great. It is. Okay. All right. (MAN COUGHING) What? I think Stanley just coughed. Hey, Pam. Do you need me to walk you to your vehicular transport? No, thanks. All right. Oscar, got big plans tonight I'm on a call. Okay. Kevin. Big man, big man, what are you doing tonight? Where are you off to? My brother is in town and we are going to see the Alaska Film Festival Okay, all right. Hey, Angela. Rushie, rushie! Where're you rushing off to? I'm just leaving for the day. Yeah, well, duh! Where're you headed? Charity bake drive. Liar! You are a liar. No. No, I'm not! (SIGHING) Dwight! Oh, Dwight, my loyal compadre. You and I are hanging tonight. The two of us. We are celebrating our freedom and our manhood. You know what? Why don't we watch that show that you've been wanting to watch? That stupid Battleship Galaxy. Battlestar Galactica. That's Whatever stupid show you want to watch, we're watching it. I can't tonight. Unfortunately, I've got plans. I have to go to practice. Soccer practice. I didn't know you played soccer, Dwight. Clarinet. You, too, Dwight? Have fun tonight, whatever it is that you're doing, and I'll see you Monday. (WHISPERING) He has no idea. Quick announcement, everybody, if I could have everybody's attention. We do have wine in the kitchen and there is beer available on the porch. And despite what you might think it's not all for Meredith and Kelly. So please enjoy. Jim. You really think this is a good idea? A hide-a-key rock? Hey, you must be Dwight. You don't work with us. That's because Mark's my roommate. Hey, I love the Birkenstocks. Thanks. Yeah, I always keep an extra set in the car for special occasions. (WHISPERING) Jim, come here. When is the guest of honor coming? Oh, laterish. He's gonna love it. Great. Just wanna let you guys know that we will be taking the tour like I promised. Hey. Hey. Just in time. Do you wanna go on the group tour? We were just about to leave. Definitely. Well, the group tour is now leaving then. Ladies and gentlemen, just a few things that we're going to be pointing out to you today. You will be able to see both bedrooms and if we're lucky, maybe you get a chance to peek into the bathroom, who knows? I have to remind you also that flash photography is prohibited and as much as you can, please refrain from touching things. I know you might want to. Hey, is Katie coming? Actually, I haven't talked to her in a while. It's off? Is it cool if I call her? We can talk about that later. Okay, let's get right into it. I need two people for the first scene. (EXCLAIMING) Mr. Kotter! Mr. Kotter! Okay, Michael and Anybody? How about Mary-Beth? Okay. Come on. Okay, so you start us off, Mary-Beth. All right. Great. Okay. (SINGING) Detective Michael Scarn! I'm with the FBI! Think about this. What is the most exciting thing that can happen on TV or in movies or in real life? Somebody has a gun. That's why I always start with a gun. Because you can't top it. You just can't. I'm supposed to meet my doctor here. Have you seen him? He's a very angry midget. Boom! Freeze! Michael Scoon, FBI! You know what you did. (IMITATING GUN FIRING) Yeah, you thought you could get away with your little ruse, didn't you? Didn't you? Well, you didn't, because I know where you hid the diamonds. I've been onto you and your little friends for weeks. Boom! Boom! Boom! I'm not even in the scene! Boom! Boom! Boom! Stop! Stop! Stop! Okay. You shot me, okay, great. Stop. Okay. What? Why? You can't just shoot everyone in the scene. Well, if you hadn't stopped the scene you would have seen where it was going. Okay, what about the scene they set up? Boring. No, it wasn't. No more guns. It could've No, no, Michael. Why don't you give me all the guns you have? Just get rid of all your guns and give them to me. Great. Okay. Jim's bedroom. See, I knew we lost somebody on the tour. It's Cool. This is your desk? This is my desk. Your home office? Home office. This is it. Yeah. You have to sit down, so I can get the full effect. Okay, sure. Will do. Okay, wait. So that would make me, like, right here. Yeah, yeah, that feels about right. And then, Dwight would be, like You know what? Let's just leave that image out of it, because this is a happy place. Happy thoughts, Pam, happy thoughts. (GASPS) Yearbook. Yeah, you don't have to All right. Yes, that's not going to be awkward at all. Oh, no. Oh, yeah. You were so dorky. Thank you. CHRIS: Freeze. I'm in. Do you want to go over the rules one more time? No, no, no, no! I'm looking in my wallet for money so you can tell me my fortune. I promise it's worth it. I can see you walking out of here and you're thrilled with your reading. What are you Michael, what did you tell him? Nothing. Then why are his hands up? Bill? He told me he couldn't show it to me, but he has a gun. (SIGHING) Okay, let's call it a day. Nice job. Good. That was good. Good work, everybody! Angela! Burger? Dog? Having fun? I got sap on me. Chicken, hotdog, burger. I'm a vegetarian. There is soda inside. I didn't think the premium laser color-copy batch would sell as well as it did. It surprised us all. I'll tell you why, because I'm sorry, guys. Can we please not talk about paper? There's gotta be something else that we could talk about. (CLEARING THROAT) ANGELA: I think it's all right. I mean, Jesus drank wine. Hey, Phyllis. Come here for a second. Sure. Have you heard anything about any secret office romances or You tell me. You do mean you and Jim, right? Oh, God. I'm so sorry. I mean, I thought, you guys hang out all the time, and you're talking all the time And I'm sorry. I Oh, it's okay, it's okay. Not so fast, fire guy How do I get to Bernie's Tavern from here? Don't worry, we're all gonna carpool. To Bernie's, huh? We're all going to Bernie's? Sorry, we're not going as a group. It's just a private friend who happens to know all of us from different ways, is throwing a private birthday thing. Right, right, right, right. Well guys, I'd love to go to Bernie's with you, but you know what? I have an office party. Big office party I need to go to. Can't get out of it. Hey, see you later. Good job. Nice job, Bill. Not. (SINGING ALONG WITH KARAOKE) Here I go again on my own Going down the only road I've ever known Oh, hey, how's your little side project going? Oh, yeah, I gave that up. Really? Yeah, it turns out I was just grasping at straws. Just because two people are hanging out, it doesn't mean that they're together. You know, like, people can just be friends. And I think that it was really unfair of us to assume that there was anything else going on. (SINGING) Just turn around now 'Cause you're not welcome anymore and I got all my Surprise! Everybody! Wow. Who opened the morgue for this thing? I was just driving by, I thought I'd drop in. There's some wine. I would love a glass, if you're going to open it. Hello, temp, take my jacket. (MICHAEL LAUGHING) Oh, come on, that guy? He is a good guy, not a terrorist. Karaoke, I love it. I am a karaoke fiend. I call dibs, I got next. I got next up. Come on, let's get this party started! Okay, where is that wine? Okay, this is a duet, so, (ISLANDS IN THE STREAM PLAYING) I need somebody else. Pam, you wanna come up and sing this one? Need somebody else. Takers, please. (SINGING) Baby, when I met you there was peace unknown Kelly? I tried to get you with a fine-tooth comb I was soft inside There was something going on This is the part, it goes to the girl. (HIGH-PITCHED TONE) You do something to me that I can't explain Hold me closer and I feel no pain Every beat of my heart We got something going on Tender love is blind It requires a dedication All this love we feel needs no conversation Divided together Making love with each other MICHAEL: We're making love! Islands in the stream that is what we are No one in between How can we be wrong Sail away with me Talk! Just talk! I Shut up! Funny story. The way I got into improv was I got into improv The story about me getting into improv was that I was walking down the street, and a race car pulls up, and the guy says, "Hey you're funny. You're the funniest guy I've ever seen, "or my name is not Dale Earnhardt." And that was an improv. The real way was that I found a flier. DWIGHT: Go. Get the door. MICHAEL: Here we are. DWIGHT: Go. Push. Oh, God. DWIGHT: Push. No, no, no. Turn it around. Really shove it. You'll break it. Shove it through. Break it! MICHAEL: You shove it. Shove it back. MICHAEL: Here we go. Don't break the branches, Dwight. All right. I got a splinter. Well, suck it up. We all have problems. (DWIGHT PANTING) Hey, everybody. Look what we have. (MICHAEL LAUGHING) MICHAEL: Nice, huh? (GRUNTING) I've got it leveraged. DWIGHT: Push. Straight up. MICHAEL: On three. Ready? Big. One, two, three. DWIGHT: One, two, three. (MICHAEL GRUNTING) Merry Christmas. Did it work? Well, sort of. Why did you get it so big? A, that's what she said, and, B, I wanted it to be impressive. The biggest day of the year deserves the biggest tree of the year. But what are we gonna do with this hacked-off part? Well, that is a perfectly good mini-tree, Kevin, and we are going to sell that to charity. That's what Christmas is all about. So this year, for the first time ever, I got Pam in Secret Santa, and I got her this teapot, which I know she really wants, so she can make tea at her desk. But I'm also gonna stuff it with some inside jokes. Like, this is my high school yearbook photo. She saw it at the party, and it really makes her laugh. Not sure why. What else? This is a hot sauce packet. She put this on a hot dog a couple years ago because she thought it was ketchup. And it was really funny, so I kept the other two. This would take a little too long to explain, so I won't. And this is the card. Because Christmas is the time to tell people how you feel. Is there anything we're missing? Phyllis, you got the lights? Yes, I got those cute little ones. Do you think I should have gotten the big ones? We'll see. RYAN: Angela drafted me into the party planning committee. Her memo said that we need to prepare for every possible disaster, which to me seems excessive. Merry Christmas! Ho, ho, ho, pimp. (LAUGHING) I'm kidding. What do we got? What do we got? How many plates are we getting? Fifty. Double it. Double everything. Double ice cream. Double napkins. Double it. On me. MICHAEL: It was a tough year. I had to fire somebody this year. This party has to really rock. Check it out. Christmas bonus, 3,000 Gs. I got this for helping save the company money. So I guess some good came out of firing Devon after all. Maybe I should call him and tell him that. I want people to cut loose. I want people making out in closets. I want people hanging from the ceilings, lamp shades on the heads. I want it to be a Playboy Mansion party. And also, I want you to know and spread the word that I will have my digital camera. And I'll be taking pictures all along the way. And the best and craziest thing that happens will be on the cover of the newsletter. Incentive. You do realize that we can't serve liquor at the party. Yeah. I know. Damn it. Stupid corporate wet blankets. Like booze ever killed anybody. One. Two. Three. (GRUNTING) You guys should use a hand truck. Do we have one? No. Will you help me? No! No way. It No. Come on, Mike. Let me borrow the hat for just a couple of hours. You wanna be Santa? Yeah. Have you ever seen Santa? Yeah, I've seen Santa. Okay. Who cares? Well, I'm sorry. It just doesn't work. Michael, I would like to be the elf. That makes sense because he has elfish features. DWIGHT: Okay, everyone. Listen up. It is time to get your presents, wrap them and place them under the tree, like so. If you do not get your present wrapped and under the tree within the next five minutes, you will be disqualified from Secret Santa. All right? No exceptions except Michael. I got Angela. She is into these posters of babies dressed as adults. I got her one of those. I felt kind of weird buying that. I got Creed. And to tell you the truth, I don't know anything about Creed. I know his name's Creed. I know he works right over there. I think he's Irish and I I got him this shamrock keychain. I got myself for Secret Santa. I was supposed to tell somebody, but I didn't. You get something good this year? I think I did a pretty good job. Yeah? Who did you have? Well, I can't tell you, 'cause it's a secret. I think I got something pretty nice for my guy. Yeah? I spent a lot of dough. Lot of dough. Wow. Well, there's a $20 limit, right? So Yeah. I wanted this party to be really special so I sort of went above and beyond. That's great. Well, don't tell me who it is, 'cause I can It was Ryan. Yeah. I have Ryan. Gather round. Secret Santa, let's go. Let's go. Come on. Stanley, no. I'm gonna handle the cord. Okay, safety reasons. I know how to plug something in. I want to do it. All right, let's count it down, like Rockefeller Center. MICHAEL: Ready? Three, two, one. ALL: Three, two, one. (ALL CHEERING) MICHAEL: Not great. I'm sorry, everybody. I think the tree looks nice. Hey, I could get some flares from my car. No. No. Shake it off, everybody. Just, let's do Secret Santa. Presents are the best way to show someone how much you care. It is like this tangible thing that you can point to and say, "Hey, man, I love you this many dollars' worth." First present, Oscar. Shower radio. Neat. Oh, good, that was from me. Thanks, Kelly. You know I was gonna get one of Okay. Okay. That's enough. Let's keep it moving on. Jim. Oh, cool. That's from me. Great. Where did you get it? I don't know. It was so long ago. He obviously forgot to get me something, and then he went into his closet and dug out this little number and then threw it in a bag. Yep. That's exactly what happened. DWIGHT: Pam. Oh, my God! Thank you very much, Santa, whoever you are. It's awesome. There's a little more to it. DWIGHT: All right. Next. Ryan. No. Don't. Whoa, a video iPod. Whoa. Wow. Jeez. MICHAEL: Somebody really got carried away with the spirit of Christmas. That was me. I got carried away with the spirit. Wasn't there a $20 limit on the gift? This is 400 bucks. You don't know that. Yeah, you left the price tag on. I did? Yeah. What? Oh, shoot. Wow. Okay, well, who cares? It doesn't matter what I spent. What matters is that Christmas is fun, right? Michael. Oh, hey, for me. What is in here? Oh, come on. I knitted it for you. An oven mitt? Okay. So Phyllis is basically saying, "Hey, Michael, I know you did a lot to help the office this year "but I only care about you a homemade oven mitt's worth." I gave Ryan an iPod. Should we just keep opening up the presents? We don't do anything until Michael gives us further instructions. I got it. We are going to turn Secret Santa into Yankee Swap. What is Yankee Swap? One person chooses a gift. The next person can either choose a gift or steal that person's gift. If your gift gets stolen, then you can steal someone else's gift or choose a new gift. I thought that was called Nasty Christmas. Yeah, we call it White Elephant. Well, I call it fun! Why are we doing this? Because it's better. Because it's more special. It sounds mean. Shut it. No, it's not Okay, just give it a shot. Michael should have asked the party planning committee first. He's not supposed to just spring things on us out of nowhere. Okay, Meredith is up first. Here's the deal. You can either pick a new gift or you can steal somebody else's gift that they've already gotten, like the oven mitt. I'll take the teapot. Oh. Shouldn't we I bought that specifically for Pam. Yankee Swap! MICHAEL: That's what makes it fun. Pam, you can steal the oven mitt now. I'll take the iPod. And I have to give it to her? I don't have a choice? Yes. Now, you can steal the oven mitt, the old shirt or the shower radio or pick a new gift. That was meant for Kelly. Yeah, I figured. I think this is going great. Yikes. Well, it's for Angela, so That's, like, the creepiest thing that I've ever seen. DWIGHT: Angela, you're up. I'll take the poster. Some people like these. I will steal the iPod. MICHAEL: Everyone wants the iPod. It's a huge hit. It is almost a Christmas miracle. Oh, well, Oscar, you little gourmand, you have the next turn. I'll take the teapot. Damn it. Okay. Moving along, Meredith, let's go. I really want the iPod. (EXCLAIMING) It's already been stolen this round. Pick something else. I hope nobody takes this baby, 'cause this is great. Wow, look at that fine craftsmanship. Somebody really put a lot of work into that. It's beautiful. I'll take the oven mitt. Sucker! See, I wanted somebody to take it. Boom! Reverse psychology. Reverse psychology is an awesome tool. I don't know if you guys know about it, but basically you make someone think the opposite of what you believe and that tricks them into doing something stupid. Works like a charm. "In addition to these paint ball pellets, "your gift includes two paint ball lessons with Dwight Shrute." You and me, Michael. Yes. Who wants to take paint ball lessons? How is that better than an iPod? I never said it was better than an iPod. Michael keeps bragging about his iPod, but you know what? Two paint ball lessons with someone as experienced as I am is worth easily, like, 2 grand. Take that, Saddam. Last gift, Kevin. I want the foot bath. KEVIN: That's the thing I bought myself. I'm really psyched to use it. Maybe I should have taken the iPod. Oh, shoot. Pam, steal something or pick the final gift. I want the iPod. KELLY: Damn it. Sure you don't want the teapot? Well, I mean, it's an iPod. But Right. Sorry, I No. No. Definitely. It's Okay, well, I guess I will take that book of short stories. Yes! There you go. I want the tea pot. Gracias. Got to be kidding me. Yankee Swap is like Machiavelli meets Christmas. What is she so upset about? Maybe because you hated her present so much. Come on! I think that Yankee Swap was a big hit. I think it was a success, and I'm the one who ended up with Dwight's stupid paint ball pellets. Yeah, but, Michael, the point is that we all bought gifts for specific people. And you should have just bought a $20 gift like everyone else. Well, I didn't. I got a big bonus because I fired Devon, and I used the money to buy something awesome. Sue me! You got a bonus check? How much? It wasn't It wasn't that much. It was $3,000. All right, I'm done now. MICHAEL: Unbelievable. I do the nicest thing that anyone has ever done for these people, and they freak out. Well, happy birthday, Jesus. Sorry your party's so lame. LIQUOR STORE WORKER: It comes to $166.41. All right, now, you're the expert. Is this enough to get 20 people plastered? Fifteen bottles of vodka? Yeah, that should do it. Cool, cool. Box it up. (WE WISH YOU A MERRY CHRISTMAS PLAYING ON STEREO) I bought this teapot for Pam, and I know she really wants it. So, can I trade you for it? No trades. Come on. It's a shamrock keychain. Good luck. "A real man makes his own luck." Billy Zane, Titanic. Look it has sentimental value, Dwight. Can I buy it from you? No. I want it. I'm going to use it. You don't even drink tea. True. But I get sinus infections, and sinus infections can be cured by making your tea from green tea leaf stems Okay. and pouring it directly into your nose, like so. To think that my gift to Pam will be used for that, it's a little too much to handle. ROY: This is awesome. I know. It's totally gonna change the way I work out. Yeah, I was gonna get you one of these for Christmas, now I don't have to. I'm gonna save a ton of money. So what are you gonna get me instead? I don't know. Probably, like, a sweater or something. Uh-oh. Looks like Santa was a little naughty. (MICHAEL LAUGHING) What is that? This is Christmas spirit, as in spirits, booze. We can drink? We're really not supposed to serve alcohol. Zip it, Toby! Just I mean, it's a party. Come on. If I can't throw a good party for my employees, then I am a terrible boss. Who wants a drink? Me. Please. MICHAEL: Go! Here we go! The deal is that this is my last hurrah, 'cause I made a New Year's resolution that I'm not gonna drink anymore during the week. Hi, guys. RYAN: Hey. Does everyone know my boyfriend, Bob Vance? Kevin Malone. Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration. Stanley Hudson. Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration. Ryan Howard. Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration. What line of work you in, Bob? I think after I lost Culpepper and T.O. It was over, man. Oh, yeah, I need McMahon, Deion Branch to have big games, or else I'm done. ROY: It's possible. ROY: I can't believe you traded Shaun Alexander, man. DARRYL: I had to, I needed defense. ROY: Come on! Shaun Alexander? ROY: He's the best back in the league. DARRYL: It's defense. ROY: Oh, no. That's not worth it. DARRYL: It is worth it. ROY: Never. DARRYL: Are you kidding? You wait. Anybody making out in here? Not yet. Give it time. Oh, hey, Ebenezer, boink. Okay, how's it going in here? We're running low on cups. Do you want me to just run out and get some? Yeah, there should be some No, no, no. We'll find some. Don't leave the party. ALL: One, two, three! (DISCO MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO) Kudos to Ryan, king of the party committee. Oh, no. MICHAEL: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I really did not do anything. MICHAEL: Oh, no, no. No false modesty, my friend. You know, you don't have to answer calls during a party. Just thought you should know. No, I was just checking out my present. But I traded with Dwight. Just, I figured, you know, you went to a lot of trouble and it means a lot. And also, Roy got me an iPod or was going to get me an iPod, so Well, either way. This is an amazing gift because it comes with bonus gifts. Look inside. Oh, my God! The yearbook picture. Yeah, I think I made the right choice. Oh, my God! It's incredible. Is this the bottle timer? I didn't think you were gonna get that one. I really didn't. (PAM LAUGHING) (RAP MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO) This is so awesome. Not bad. And if it couldn't go to Ryan, you are the guy I'd want it to go to. Thank you. You're welcome. Merry Christmas, asswipe. No way. Oh, you're kidding me. Packer! Yes! Todd Packer, ladies and gentlemen. (IMITATING RAPPER) What's up, my nerds? Check it out! Oh, no, no. Oh, look at that. Icing on the cake. Pacman need a drinky. Oh, let's fix you up. Who wants to fix up Toby? Toby's gonna fix you up. Yeah. Darryl. There you go. You earned it. That's okay, Mike. No, no, no, no. I really, really want you to have it. All right. Thanks, man. Hey, Merry Christmas. Whose butt is that? Mine. Oh, how did I not guess that? Lampshade on head! It's happening! CREED: Oh, no. Hey. Oh, hello there. But what are you doing? I don't know. You shouldn't do things like that. The man is supposed to do that. (SCREAMING ANGRILY) Thanks for the party, Michael. MEREDITH: Yeah. MICHAEL: Oh, hey Listen up. We're going to Poor Richard's. Who's in? I'm in. Yes. OSCAR: Michael? Poor Richard's? Yeah. That sounds good. Christmas is awesome. First of all, you get to spend time with people you love. Secondly, you can get drunk and no one can say anything. Third, you give presents. What's better than giving presents? And fourth, getting presents. So, four things. Not bad for one day. It's really the greatest day of all time. Hey, Meredith. Heading over to Poor Richard's? Yep. Cool, cool, cool. Do you need a ride? All right, let's head out. Sounds good. Do you have a coat? Yeah. Okay!   Hey. Hello. Jim! What's up, buddy? This is not funny. Why is my stuff in here? JIM: That's weird. A dollar for a stapler, that's pretty good. Yeah, well, I'm not paying for my own stuff, okay? I know you did this, 'cause you're friends with the vending machine guy. Who, Steve? Yeah, Steve. Whatever his name is. What do I want? What do I want? (EXCLAIMS) It's a pencil cup. Oh, no, no, no. That's my pencil cup. I don't think so, I just bought it. I think so, and you're gonna hand it over to me. I love these. Okay, fine. Where's my wallet? There it is. J1. Here, you know what? I don't have any I've got some nickels. $0.05, $0.10, $0.15, $0.20, $0.25 Hello, everyone. Good morning, Michael. Where are we going this afternoon? (EXCLAIMING) Last week, Michael sent out this mysterious memo. "It's time for our first-quarter camaraderie event. "So pack a swimsuit, a toothbrush, rubber-soled shoes and a ski mask." A ski mask and a swimsuit. So that he can have us rob a bank and then escape through the sewers. And brush our teeth. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Yeah. Michael. Stanley, bo-banley. I need to know Banana-fana-fo-fanley. what we're doing. Me, my, mo, manly. You said bring a toothbrush. Stanley. Is this an overnight? Maybe. The suspense is just so exciting, isn't it? Should my wife tell her boss she's not coming in tomorrow? Maybe. I don't know. Not maybe. Yes or no? Well, no, but Okay, don't spoil it for everybody, all right? But we are going on a booze cruise on Lake Wallenpaupack. In January? It's cheaper. This is not just another party. This is a leadership training exercise. Right? I'm going to combine elements of fun and motivation and education into a single mind-blowing experience. It is now time to unveil the destination of this year's retreat. We are going on a harbor cruise of Lake Wallenpaupack. Yes! It's a booze cruise. All right! I have a test for business school tomorrow night. Is it okay if I skip the cruise and study for that? No, this is mandatory. But don't worry. You know what? You're gonna learn plenty. This is gonna turn your life around, Ryan. I'm already in business school. Well, this KELLY: Wait, Michael. Yeah? Why did you tell us to bring a bathing suit? To throw you off the scent. Yeah, but I bought a bathing suit. Well, just keep the tags on and you can return it. I took the tags off already. Well, that's not my fault, okay? Just We're not gonna pay for a bathing suit. Okay, I know what you're all thinking. "Who is this smart little cookie?" Her name is Brenda something, and she is from Corporate. And she is here, like you, to learn from what I have to say. I am a great motivational speaker. I attended a Tony Robbins event by the airport last year and It wasn't the actual course. You have to pay for the actual course. But it talked about the actual course. And I've incorporated a lot of his ideas into my own course. Leader ship. The word "ship" is hidden inside the word "leadership" as its derivation. So if this office is in fact a ship, as its leader, I am the captain. But we're all in the same boat. Teamwork! Last year, Michael's theme was "Bowl over the competition." So guess where we went. Now, on this ship that is the office, what is the sales department? Anyone? How about the sales department is the sails? Yes, Darryl, the sales department makes sales. Good. Let me just explain. I see the sales department as the furnace. A furnace? How old is this ship? How about the anchor? PHYLLIS: What does the furnace do? All right, let's not get hung up on the furnace. It's just It's the sales I see the sales department are down there. They're in the engine room, and they're shoveling coal into the furnace. Right? I mean, who saw the movie Titanic? They were very important in the movie Titanic. Who saw it? Show of hands. Not really sure what movie you're talking about. Are you sure you got the title right? Titanic. I think you're thinking of The Hunt for Red October. No! I'm Leo DiCaprio! Come on! Michael stands in the front of the boat and says that he's king of the world within the first hour, or I give you my next paycheck. Michael, everyone in the engine room drowned. No. Thank you, spoiler alert. You saw the movie, those of you who did. You They're happy down there in the furnace room. And they're dirty and grimy and sweaty. And they're singing their ethnic songs and Actually, that might be warehouse. What? The No, no No, I didn't Okay. Well, the Okay, in a nutshell, what I'm saying is "leadership." We'll talk more about that on the boat. Ship. Aye-aye, Captain. (MICHAEL SINGING) A three hour tour A three hour tour MICHAEL: Pam, you are Mary Ann. We have the Professor and Ginger. Welcome aboard! Angela, you are Mrs. Howell, Lovey. The native. Sometimes they come from neighboring We have one of the Globetrotters. I am the Skipper, and, Dwight, you will be Gilligan! Cool! Actually, I'm the skipper. Okay. But you could be Gilligan. No! I'd rather die. Hi. I am Michael Scott. I am the captain of this party. (EXCLAIMS) I'm Captain Jack. I'm captain of the ship. I'm also captain of anyone who sets foot on this ship. Hi, welcome aboard. Okay. In an office, when you are ranking people, manager is higher than captain. On a boat, who knows? It's nebulous. Hey, look! I'm king of the world! (MICHAEL WHOOPING) (DWIGHT WHOOPING) (CAPTAIN JACK CLAPPING) CAPTAIN JACK: Okay, all right! Welcome aboard! I am your captain, Captain Jack. And I am the Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin, Michael Scott. Welcome, welcome! Okay, so Okay, so Please. The life preservers Right. they are located underneath the seats all along the perimeter of the boat. Don't worry, you are not gonna be needing life preservers tonight. Well, we might be. It's just gonna be Please let me finish. Okay? Thank you. Well So the Coast Guard requires that I tell you where the safety exits are. Now, on this ship, it's very easy. Anywhere over the side. (LAUGHING) Not only am I your ship's captain, I am also your party captain! (WHOOPING) We're gonna get it going here in just a few minutes. And I'm your party captain, too! And you are gonna put on your dancing shoes later on! Hey, Mike, Mike, Mike. So we are gonna If you don't mind rock it! What? Please! Okay? If the boat's rocking, don't come knocking! Michael. Yeah? Your company employees are not the only people on the boat tonight. Okay? We're all gonna have a good time tonight. Hey, listen, listen, Mike. Why don't you let me and my crew do our job? You just sit back and have a good time. Okay. Yep. So All right? You guys, it's like we're in high school and we're at the cool table. (LAUGHING) Right? Yeah. Pam, were you a cheerleader? No, she was total "Miss Artsy-Fartsy" in high school. She wore the turtleneck and everything. That's hilarious. It's not hilarious Where did you go to school? Bishop O'Hare. His-slop-who-cares-a? We played you! You really look familiar. Did you You cheered for them, didn't you? No. Yes, I did. (SINGING) A-W-E-S-O-M-E Awesome, awesome is what we are We're the football superstars! A-W-E-S-O-M-E ROY: I remember that, and we crushed you, like, 42-10. Having fun? Yeah. Everybody's really nice. Good, well, that is what Scranton is all about. Not like you New Yorkers! So When are you gonna start the presentation? I already sort of started it back at the office and on the dock with the Gilligan thing. So, right now, I was thinking. Yes, okay! Listen up, all you Dunder Mifflinites! I would like to talk to you all about life preservers. Now, one important life preserver in business is IT support. Not now, Mike, we're doing the limbo! That's right, partiers, it's time to limbo, limbo, limbo! (DWIGHT WHOOPING) So, okay. All right, I need a volunteer to come up here and hold my stick! Who's it gonna be? Okay. Me, me, me. Usually it's a woman. I'm stronger. Hey, I got an idea. How would you like to steer the ship, Dwight? Keep us on a steady course. Keep a sharp eye out. I'm counting on you. I was the youngest pilot in Pan Am history. When I was four, the pilot let me ride in the cockpit and fly the plane with him. And I was four and I was great. And I would have landed it, but my dad wanted us to go back to our seats. (BAND PLAYING PEPPY MUSIC) (PEOPLE CHEERING) All right, all right, that was great! Now it's time for the dance contest! Why don't we do that after I do my presentation? Nope. Dance contest! All right, we'll have a motivational dance contest! Hit it! (BAND PLAYING DANCE MUSIC) Yeah! Okay! Dancing! It is a primal art form used in ancient times to express yourself with the body! And communicate! Sometimes you have to take a break from being the kind of boss that's always trying to teach people things. Sometimes you have to just be the boss dancing. (SINGING) What do you do with a drunken sailor? What do you do with a drunken sailor? What do you do with a drunken sailor Early in the morning? Come inside and talk to me. I can't. Do you want us to run aground, woman? Snorkel shot! Snorkel shot! Snorkel shot! Snorkel shot! Snorkel shot! Yeah! Who's next? Come on! Pammy, come on! Come on! No, I'm not doing that. Come on! (ALL CHATTERING) Hey, why don't we find, like, a quieter place to hang out? No, I just gotta wait for Darryl to do his shot. Just a minute. Come on. Darryl! Darryl! It's getting kind of rowdy down there. Yeah. (LAUGHING) "Darryl, Darryl, Darryl!" Sometimes I just don't get Roy. I mean, I don't know. So What's it like dating a cheerleader? (PAM CHUCKLING) I'm cold. So, what's this presentation all about? See? This is of general interest. It is about priorities and making decisions, using the boat as an analogy. What is important to you? If the boat is sinking, what do you save? Women and children. No, no, salesmen and profit centers. That's a stupid analogy. Okay. Well, obviously you don't know anything about leadership. Well, I was the captain of a PC-1 Cyclone coastal patrol boat during Desert Storm. Wow, you should be the motivational speaker. Him? Okay. Yeah, he gives me real responsibility, Michael. Captain Jack delegates. He's let me steer the ship for the last hour. I'd like to be engaged. How did you manage to pull that off? (LAUGHS) I've been engaged for three years, and there's no end in sight. So you don't want to ask my advice. Suppose your office building's on fire, Jim, who would you save? Let's see The customer, because the customer is king. Not what I was looking for, but a good thought. He's just sucking up. When you were in the Navy, did you ever almost die? Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, and I wasn't thinking about some customer. I was thinking about my first wife. The day I got back on shore, I married her. You know what? I would save the receptionist. I just wanted to clear that up. ROY: Everybody, could I get your attention for just a second? Can you listen to me for a second? We were up at the front, and we were talking about what's really important and Pam, I think enough is enough. I think we should set a date for our wedding. (ALL CHEERING) How about June 10th? Come on, let's do it! Come on, baby! MAN 1: Yeah! Congratulations! Congratulations! MAN 2: Yeah! Yeah! Oh, my God! I love you, baby! Congratulations! (PEOPLE CHEERING) You know what, I don't want to take credit for this, but Roy and I were just having a conversation about making commitments and making choices. Right? Did I motivate you? No, it's Captain Jack. Well Captain Jack. Could have been either one of us, because we pretty much were saying the same thing. Congratulations! That is great! We gotta celebrate! ALL: Yeah! (SCREAMING) CAPTAIN JACK: Hey, hey, hey! I got an idea, I got an idea. I could marry you right now as captain of the ship. MAN: Yes! I could marry you as Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin! No, no, no. I want my mom and dad to be there. Then I'll give you away! No, thank you. (BAND PLAYING SOFT MUSIC) Do you think that'll ever be us? No. What is wrong with you? Why did you even bring me here tonight? I don't know. Let's break up. What? This is where old Captain Jack drives the boat. Wow! (MEREDITH LAUGHS) Seasick? Captain Jack says you should look at the moon. Captain Jack's a fart-face. (RETCHING) I'm on medication. Really? What? Vomacillin. (CLEARING THROAT) Okay, all right. It's time to be boss. Time to motivate. Let's blow some minds here. Okay, guys, guys, guys. Cool it. Everybody? Dunder Mifflin Scranton employees, Brenda, I've some very, very urgent news I need to tell everybody. Right now. Listen up. The ship is sinking. Okay? We're going down right now. Just wrap your heads around the reality of that. Please! Everybody, it's my turn now, okay? Captain Jack is gone. In five minutes, this ship is going to be at the bottom of the lake, and there aren't enough spaces on the lifeboat. Who are we gonna save? Do we save sales? Do we save customer service? Do we save accounting? This is a business scenario. Right? It's a scary It's a predicament. Hey! What the hell is going on here? And it's something that each and every one of us have to think about. I'm in the brig. See? The boat's not as corporate-friendly as advertised. What is the deal with the guy jumping overboard? What was If he had just waited and heard what I had to say, he would be motivated right now, and not all wet. (SIGHING) Is somebody there? What happened to you? (SIGHING) Captain Jack has a problem with authority. Right, 'cause you announced that his ship was sinking? Yeah. He just totally lost it. If you ask me, he caused the panic. What a night. Well, it's nice for you. Your friend got engaged. She was always engaged. Roy said the first one didn't count. That's great. You know, to tell you the truth, I used to have a big thing for Pam. So Really? You're kidding me. You and Pam? Wow! I would have never put you two together. You really hid it well. God! I usually have a radar for stuff like that. You know I made out with Jan. Yeah, I know. Yeah, yeah. Well, Pam is cute. Yeah. She's really funny, and she's warm, and she's just Anyway. Well, if you like her so much, don't give up. She's engaged. BFD. Engaged ain't married. Never, ever, ever give up. DWIGHT: Don't worry, Michael. I'm taking us to shore. It's a fake wheel, dummy. Well, Lords of the Ring trilogy, if you see it back to back, Yeah. it's really long, but it's good. Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Pam, it's Michael. Help me. I need help right now! Michael, what's wrong? I'm hurt. I have hurt myself. (GROANING) Oh, my God! Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait! Oh, this is not looking good, Pam. Michael, do you need me to call an ambulance? No! I want you to pick me up. Okay. What's going on? Wait a sec. I thought you said that you were hurt. I am hurt. I hurt my foot. I'm sorry. Pam, what is going on? I want to come to work, but I need you to come and pick me up. (ON SPEAKER PHONE) Oh, God! Hey, whoa, Michael. Oh, God! It's Okay. It's Jim. Just say again really loudly what happened. Okay, I burned my foot very badly on my Foreman grill and I now need someone to come and bring me in to work. You burned your foot on a Foreman grill? I enjoy having breakfast in bed. I like waking up to the smell of bacon. Sue me. And since I don't have a butler, I have to do it myself. So, most nights before I go to bed, I will lay six strips of bacon out on my George Foreman grill. Then go to sleep. When I wake up, I plug in the grill. I go back to sleep again. Then I wake up to the smell of crackling bacon. It is delicious. It's good for me. It's a perfect way to start the day. Today, I got up, I stepped onto the grill, and it clamped down on my foot. That's it. I don't see what's so hard to believe about that. MICHAEL: Pam, could you come get me? (HESITATING) I have to stay here and answer the phone. Okay, could someone come and get me, please? Ryan? Michael, you should stay home and rest. There's no toilet paper here. Could Ryan Tell Ryan to bring toilet paper. Could you tell him that? Can you hop? I tried hopping, Kevin, and I bumped my elbow against the wall, and now my elbow has a protuberance. No one wants to pick me up? DWIGHT: What is going on? What is going on? Michael is sick and he wants one of us to rescue him. I'm not sick! I'm I'm coming, Michael! I'm gonna save you! Don't! Is that Dwight? I do not want Dwight. Okay! Hold on, Michael, I am coming! Wait there! I don't want Dwight! Michael, why don't you call your girlfriend? I don't have a girlfriend. But you said you went out with her this weekend. That was all made up. Just someone come, okay? Anyone. Anyone, but Dwight. (CRASHING) What was that? What was that? (PAM AND JIM EXCLAIMING) JIM: He hit the pole. It's broken, right? He can't Oh, my gosh. Oh, Dwight. Dwight. (PAM AND JIM EXCLAIMING) Oh, my God. Oh, my gosh. Is he okay? He's still driving. JIM: Dwight, you forgot your bumper. MICHAEL: Hello? Please don't send Dwight. Morning, everyone. Don't freak out. I forbid anybody to freak out. Clearly, I have had a very serious accident, but I will recover. God willing. I just want to be treated normally today. Normal would actually be good, considering the trauma that I've been through. You missed two big conference calls today, one with corporate. Oh, did you explain why? No, I didn't mention that you cooked your foot. Burned my foot, Pam. Please stop popping my cast. Thank you. So where are you shipping your foot? (LAUGHING SARCASTICALLY) So, where are you shipping Your foot. MICHAEL: Thank you. Pam, messages, please. You didn't have any. Really? Well, it seemed very important to you earlier that you needed to stay and Do my job? No. Your job is being my friend, Pam. Ow! God! It slipped. What Sorry. It's just that before, you said you didn't want any special treatment. I don't want any special treatment, Pam. I just want you to treat me like you would a family member who's undergone some sort of serious physical trauma. I don't think that's too much to ask. Do you want some aspirin? Because you seem a little fussy. No, I don't want some aspirin. Yeah, I am fussy. Aspirin's not gonna do a damn thing. I'm sitting here with a bloody stump of a foot. Pam, I am Assistant Regional Manager and I can take care of him. Part of my duties are to (MICHAEL SIGHING) What? Part of your duties are to what? What? You just said that part of your duties are to Something. No, I didn't. Yes, you did. What is wrong with you? What is wrong with you? Where is my corn bread? Here you go. Thank you. Did you get all dark meat like I like? Yes, I ordered three full rotisserie chickens worth of all dark meat. Where are the yams? They were out of yams. I got you creamed spinach. Did you go to the one in Stroudsburg? Yes. And they had no yams? They had no yams. How strange. Because they always have yams. Oh, man, is that a Prism DuroSport? You've seen one of these? Yeah. They're like an iPod, only they're better, because they're chunkier and more solid. Roy gave it to me for Christmas. I'm trying to figure out how to put songs on it. Oh, no, no. Don't go there. I know this Russian website where you can download songs for two cents apiece. Really? Yeah, I'll write down the address for you. Only, the only thing is, is that all the songs are in Russian. Kidding. Oh. Why would they all be Okay, see you later, Pan. Pan? Pam. Pam? (SIGHING) Oh, God. (PHONE RINGING) What? Come here, please. Tell me before I come there.

Oh, no. It's broken. What? No, it's fine. I told you it wouldn't break. You could throw it all day long. That is so cool. Thanks, Dwight. You're welcome. So, I guess Pam and Dwight are friends now. Oh, God, no. Dwight isn't my friend. Oh, my God. Dwight's kind of my friend. No, no. No one is helping me out at all, Mom. No, I'm not gonna call Jan. She'd just worry, drive down here and make a big thing. Who told you that? No, it was mutual. What is Pam doing chatting with you? You like candy? It's all right. 'Cause you're sweeter than candy. What is wrong with you? Wow, you just dive right in. You know, around age 12, I just started going for it, you know. (THUDDING) MICHAEL: Help! (MICHAEL GROANING) Oh, God! Oh, help! Help me. What happened? I fell off the toilet. I'm caught between the toilet and the wall. What do you need? Not you. Someone else. Get Pam. I don't think Pam's gonna wanna come in to the men's room. Get Ryan. He needs to lift me, and he needs to clean me up a little bit. Bring a wet towel. Ryan is dead. No, he's not. Dead. I just saw him. No. Can you just get up yourself? You only grilled your foot. Forget it. I'll just get up myself. (MICHAEL GROANING) (CRASHING) Help! (GROANING) Oh, God! Do you think Dwight's being a little weird today? No. He's actually been really nice and helpful. And that isn't weird? Well Can I have everyone's attention, please? Phyllis. Oscar. Ryan, who is supposed to be dead. Can I ask you all a question? Do you know what it's like to be disabled? Oscar? I had scoliosis as a girl. Never heard of it. No, a real disability, not a woman's trouble. When I was a teenager, I was in an iron lung. How old are you? No, it Look, the point is, I am the only one here who has a legitimate disability. Although I'm sure Stanley has had his fair share of obstacles. I'm not disabled, and neither are you. Okay. What does this look like to you, Stanley? Mail Boxes Etc. Shut it. Okay. Well. Well, you know what? Disabilities are not things to be laughed at or laughed about. You people are jerks. Imagine if you had left Stevie Wonder on the floor of that bathroom instead of me. Oh, we wouldn't. We love Stevie Wonder. (SIGHING) I burned my foot! Okay, 20 minutes, conference room, everybody's in there! Dad? While we are waiting for our special guest to arrive, I wanted you all to take a look at a few of the many, many disabled icons who have contributed so much to our society. JIM: Quick question. Yeah. Why is Tom Hanks on the wall? Twice. Good question. Forrest Gump, mentally challenged. Philadelphia, AIDS. I think that's from Big. I don't think so. No. Yeah, he's dancing on a piano with Robert Loggia. He grew into a man overnight, rare disability. Still works. (SIGHING) A crossword puzzle, Stanley? Seriously, are you learning nothing here? Mmm-hmm. What do you mean, "Mmm-hmm"? I mean I'm learning nothing. Okay. Michael Scott. I'm looking for Michael Scott. Yes. Right in here. Good. Come on in. Great. This, ladies and gentlemen, is our special guest. Sorry I'm late. Somebody parked in the handicapped parking space. Hey, everyone, I'm Billy Merchant. You may have seen me around here before. I'm the Properties Manager of this office park. You are so brave. You are so brave. Thank you. Actually, I've been meaning to come by here for a long time But it's hard for you, right? Because you're in a wheelchair. No, I just have a lot of properties to manage. Let me ask you something. How long does it take for you to do something simple every day? Like brush your teeth in the morning. I don't know, like 30 seconds. Oh, my God. That's three times as long as it takes me. How did you get in your wheelchair? This morning? Just like every other morning, just climbed on in. (ALL LAUGHING) Hey, hey, hey, hey! Not funny. Not funny. Hey, hey, relax. Just joking around here. Well, that's good. He still has a sense of humor. Listen, I've actually used a chair since I was four years old. I don't really notice it anymore. Well, they do. They notice it, don't you? You notice it. It's the first thing you saw when he rolled in here, isn't it? I wanna clamp Michael's face in a George Foreman grill. So, there were just a couple things I wanted to remind everybody of. Okay. First is parking. You can't block the freight entrance with your car even if your blinkers are on. Does anybody have any questions? Yes. Yeah. Yes. Dwight, you have your hand up. Ignore him. You know what? We're not that different, you and I. When I clamped my foot into a non-stick grill You know what, Michael? Yeah. Let me stop you right there. Okay. And leave. Did you see Born on the Fourth of July? I was under the impression that Billy would be more like that guy. What's wrong with that guy? You mean today? He stepped on a George Foreman grill and he burned his foot. No, not Michael. The moon-faced kid who crashed into the pole. He looks like he has a concussion. (MICHAEL POPPING BUBBLE WRAP) Hey. I found the pudding cups you wanted at a gas station in Carbondale! You did it. Look at you. And with the plate and the napkin. Very nice. Thank you, Ryan. You are very welcome. Did you get the yams? No, the gas station in Carbondale did not have fresh yams. (SIGHING) Oh, okay. I'll just have the pudding. You sure? Yeah. Okay. You know what? I feel better. Ryan brought me some chocolate pudding and his kindness healed my foot. Yeah, baby! I am feeling better. My body's literally healing itself. It is amazing what the human body is capable of when you have a powerful brain. RYAN: I ground up four extra-strength aspirin and put them in Michael's pudding. I do the same thing with my dog to get him to take his heartworm medicine. Oh, finally feel the blood coursing through my foot veins. (EXCLAIMING) Okay, I think we need to take him to the hospital DWIGHT: No, no, no. 'cause I'm pretty sure he has a concussion. Oh, now you feel some compassion for him. He needs to go right now, and you're his emergency contact. I think you should go with him. Why don't you go with him? I barely know him. I want Michael to take me. I can't take you. I don't have my car, and yours is all vomitty. You can take my van. Oh, okay. That's great. No, I can't drive. Jim, why don't you drive? Fine. We'll go. I'm still recovering, so let's just Ryan, can you get my coat, please? Slowly, slowly. Okay, let's just get to the elevator. (DWIGHT IMITATING HELICOPTER) What are you doing? Vietnam sounds. Stop it. Stop, stop, stop, stop. Tired. Dwight, you can't lay down. Let's take a break. Wake up. (GROANING) Wait, here, let me help you, Dwight. Come on. Okay, Pam. Thanks. Get up. Get up. You're the best. JIM: Just keep him awake. It smells like chicken soup. I know. I have to go to the hospital. I know. Where are we going? I just wanna say goodbye, okay? Well, I'll be back, I mean Yes, I know, but it's gonna be different. Why? It's just hard to explain. Oh, Pam, you're adorable. Oh, my goodness. Come here. Huggy-hugs. Shotgun! You don't think you should sit in the back with Dwight? The rules of shotgun are very simple and very clear. The first person to shout "shotgun" when you're within the sight of the car gets the front seat. That's how the game is played. There are no exceptions for someone with a concussion. Oh, God, a minivan. What is Meredith's problem? Well, I think she has a kid. Yeah, she has one kid and no husband. She's not gonna find one driving this thing around. Where are we going? Come on, get inside. Where are we going? We're going to Chuck E. Cheese. Chuck E. Cheese? Oh, God, I'm so sick of Chuck E. Cheese. We're going to the hospital, Michael. I know. I'm just saying. Dwight, what are you drinking? I found it under the seat. Oh, my God. Dwight, put that down. I'm thirsty. No! Give the bottle to Michael. No! Give the bottle to Michael. Give it to me, Dwight. Just keep your eyes on the road. Give me the bottle or you're fired! You can't fire me. I don't work in this van. Give it to me, Dwight. No. Give me the bottle! Will you stop? Give me the bottle, Dwight! Michael, stop! Just give it. Michael, stop! Stop. Stop it! Stop spraying me! Give me the bottle! My eyes! Stop spraying me! Give me the bottle! Dwight, what is your middle name? Danger. Something with a "K." It's Kurt. Wow, I'm so sad that I know that. What do I write under "reason for visit"? Concussion. JIM: What did you write? (CLEARS THROAT) Nothing. I wrote, "Bringing someone to the hospital." So you thought they meant your reason for coming to the hospital? No, no. You know what, Jim? This isn't about me anymore. I made a miraculous recovery, which is more than I can say for him. Come on, Dwight. (SPUTTERING) Hi, Michael. Hi, Dwight. (MOANING) Doctor, what is more serious, a head injury or a foot injury? A head injury. Well, you don't have all the information. The foot has been fairly severely burned, and healed quickly, very quickly. Actually, like, suspiciously quickly. So I'm ordering a CAT scan. DWIGHT: What is that? Look, since you have the machine up and running, can I just stick my foot in? We can take a look. Well, for a burn, you really just need to look at the outside of the foot. Okay, what kind of machine is that? Does the skin look red and swollen? That's what she said. That's my joke. Damn it, Dwight. Okay, no electronics past this point. Camera, sound equipment It's okay, they're with me. No metal of any kind. All right, well, I guess this is where we leave you off. I don't wanna do this. You should have thought of that before you crashed your head on your way to pick me up. So, we'll see you when you get out. Oh. Fine. Fine. (BEEPS) (INAUDIBLE) (PHONE RINGING) Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Dunder Mifflin, this is Jim. Oh, my God. What's going on? Is Dwight okay? He should be fine, but they brought him in for a CAT scan. I can't believe he's getting a CAT scan. Michael went in there with him, too. It's pretty sweet. Really? Michael went in with him? Mmm-hmm. Wow. But they shouldn't be much longer now. So we'll be back soon. Okay, that's good news. Yeah, no, I'll let you go. Okay. Okay. Bye. Bye. Hey, Oscar. What's up, Pam? I just wanted to let you know that Dwight's gonna be okay. The doctor said there's a really simple treatment for a concussion. So he'll probably even be back at work tomorrow. Okay. I just thought you'd wanna know that. Okay, Mr. Schrute, inhale with me on three. One, two Sir! Stop that. Stop. Stop that. Nothing much, what's up with you? I cannot believe I fell for that. Oh, my gosh! What? What? Where's the funny? Give it to me. Is it me or does it smell like updog in here? What's "updog"? Nothing much, what's up with you? Oh, wow. I walked right into that. Oh, that's brilliant. Hey, Stanley, is that jacket made of updog? I'm on the phone. (STANLEY CHATTERING) What flavor coffee is that? Updog? What's that? I don't know. Nothing, what's up with you? Huh? No, damn it. What does that mean? What does what mean? That thing you just said. Just forget it. Dwight! Hey, is it me, or does this place smell like updog? What's "updog"? Gotcha! Oh, God. Crap. Nothing. How are you doing? Good. How are you doing? Damn it! MICHAEL: Today is spring cleaning day here at Dunder Mifflin. And yes, I know it's January. I am not an idiot. But, if you do your spring cleaning in January, guess what you don't have to do in the spring! Anything. They say a cluttered desk means a cluttered mind. Well, I say an empty desk means an Empty mind. No, that's not No, that's not what I was gonna say. Meredith, the men's room. Make sure you replace the urinal cakes, they're worn down. Kevin, file drawers. Angela, kitchen. Oscar, dusting. Where is Oscar? He's out sick. That's unacceptable. I agree. It's unacceptable. What are you guys doing? Michael? Yes? Oscar is out sick. On a Friday? (PHONE RINGING) Can I do some of the talking? I will do the talking. Okay, let him know that I'm here. OSCAR: Hello? What difference does it make whether you're here? Hello? Hi, Oscar, it's Michael. And Dwight. Yeah. Heard you were under the weather? Yeah, I think I came down with the flu. Really? Oh, that is a shame. You know it's cleaning day here today. Could've used some of that famous Hispanic cleaning ethic. Yeah, I feel terrible about it. Ask him his symptoms, I'm on WebMD. What are your symptoms? I have the chills. I'm feeling nauseous, and my head's killing. Checks out. Michael, is there anything you need from me? I'd like to go back to bed. I need you to go to bed. I need you to get better. See you Monday, unless you're still sick. So have a great long weekend. I'll just be sleep Okay, first impressions. He sounded sick. Which is exactly how you'd want to sound, if you wanted someone to think you were sick. That's exactly what I was thinking. Question. May I investigate? Yeah. Drop what you're doing. Make this a priority. Because an office can't function efficiently unless people are at their desks, doing their jobs. I bought my veil. Oh, my God, that is so exciting! Can I be a bridesmaid? Listen, you don't have to answer now, but how are you going to do your hair? Okay, I was thinking about wearing it down. Kind of like, I don't know, like, loose with big curls? You look like an angel. I'm seriously gonna cry. Wowey! Mikey likey! Why don't you wear your hair like that all the time? It's much sexier. Man, this must be torture for you. Yeah, on the booze cruise, I told Michael about some feelings I used to have for Pam. I had just broken up with Katy, and had a couple of drinks, and I confided in the world's worst confidante. Hey, Michael. MICHAEL: Hey, Jim-bag! Remember that thing I told you on the booze cruise about Pam? That was personal. So if we could just keep that between you and me, that would be great. Really? Who else knows? Nobody. Wow. Jim and I are great friends. We hang out a ton, mostly at work. But the fact that he told me his secret and no one else says everything about our friendship. And it is why I intend on keeping that secret for as long as I possibly can. My lips are sealed. (SINGING) My lips are sealed Bangles. All right. Great. Thank you. (SINGING) Can you hear me? They talk about us Telling lies Listen, temp. I'm conducting a little investigation. So, I'm no longer gonna be able to head up spring cleaning. Do you think you can handle it? Yeah, I think I can handle it. Do you think, or do you know? I think. Oh, God. Here. Hey, what you getting? I'm going with grape. Good stuff. Good stuff. Did you see the game last night? Which game? Any of them. So, what's the 411? Any updates on the "P" situation? I don't know any P-A-M. P-A-M. Yeah. Oh, okay. No, it's okay, we're talking code. What is? Listen, Stan, you know, how long does it take for you to pick out a soda? I'm gonna take off, actually. All right, well, cool. Still deciding? Peach ice tea. You're gonna hate it. Hey, Oscar. How you doing? Dwight Schrute calling. Listen, little question for you, buddy. I called six minutes ago and no one answered. So, I was wondering if you could explain Oh, I see. So, sounds like you're too sick to come into work, but you're well enough to go to the pharmacy. There are several different ways to tell if a perp is lying. The liar will avoid direct eye contact. The liar will cover part of his or her face with his hand, especially the mouth. The liar will perspire. Unfortunately, I spoke to Oscar on the phone so none of this is useful. It's grape! Soda! Tony the Tiger. Yeah. You don't hear that much anymore. Not so much. Okay, what is going on here? Nothing. Oh, really, nothing? Fact. You are drinking grape soda, you never drink grape soda. Fact. You are talking to Jim, you never talk to Jim. Fact. I love grape soda, I always have. Fact. Jim and I talk all the time. We tell each other secrets. Okay, so what is the secret, Michael? Look, I I had asked Michael if I could head up the Oscar investigation. And he said that only Dwight was capable of handling such sensitive material. Is that true? (STAMMERING) I don't know. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It is. Thank you, Michael. I know you're telling the truth. Okay. I can tell. I won't let you down. Good. Thanks. (SIGHING) Nice. That was slick. What are you doing for lunch? I don't know. I'm probably just gonna eat my ham and cheese sandwich in the break room. Oh, nonsense, no way. No. Why don't I take you out to lunch? My treat. No. That's all right. Thank you, though. It's I gotta do some cleaning, I should probably stick around here. Hey, you know what we could do? We could spread out a blanket in the break room, have a little picnic, order some 'za. Talk about you know who. Oh, no. You know what? Let's go out. That was a good idea. Let's go out. I know just the place. Oh, man. You should order milk. Get it? Why do I like Hooters? Well, I will give you two reasons. The boobs and the hot wings. Here we go, here we go. Bogey at 3:00. Hi. Hey, I'm Dana, welcome to Hooters. We're not worthy, we're not worthy! Hello, Dana. I am Michael and this is Jim. And we are brothers. No. We're not brothers. I'm his boss, actually, and I treat him well. I'm taking him out to lunch because I can afford it. And he can have whatever he wants. Could I just have the ham and cheese sandwich? DANA: Great. Thanks. And for you? Tell me, Dana. How is your chicken breast? Oh, it's great. It's served with our world-famous wing sauce. Sounds yummy. I will have a chicken breast, hold the chicken. (LAUGHS) Is that what you really want? No, I'm gonna have the gourmet hot dog. Great. Who took all the black ones? That's a communal bowl. So, how did Oscar sound when he called in? Sick. Like lots of sniffling, I don't know. Sniffling, how? How many different ways are there to sniffle? Three. Okay, it was the second one. Okay, good, thank you. That wasn't so hard, now, was it? What do you like best about Pam? Oh, I really don't want to talk about it. Is it her legs, her boobs, her She's easy to talk to, I guess. And, uh, she's got a really good sense of humor. Really? Never gets any of my jokes. What about you? Her boobs, definitely. Wow. That's not what I meant. DANA: Here you go. Oh, thank you. And I understand we have a birthday today! Oh, happy birthday, Jim! DANA: Ready, girls? Front side! (SINGING) You put your front side in You put your front side out You put your front side in And you shake it all about You do the hokey-pokey And you turn yourself around That's what it's all about! Thank you. Oh, yeah! Thanks. Thanks, Dana. Thank you very much! There you go. Hilarious. Hey! What did you guys talk about? Just, you know, politics, literature. I hate you. Quick Oscar update. I have conducted interviews with everyone in the office Just go to his house and see if he's sick. I could have done this investigation in, like, 20 minutes. Including prep time? Just do it. RYAN: If I had to, I could clean out my desk in five seconds, and nobody would ever know I had ever been here. And I'd forget, too. MICHAEL: Expense this. Michael, is that a wig? No, it's I wear it like that sometimes. Is that a wig? No. This is from Hooters. Yeah. It's a business lunch. Did Toby approve this? No, he did not. I don't need his permission. You just got your corporate credit card back. You really want me to take it away again? (GROANING) It's ridiculous. They took my card away because I spent 80 bucks at a magic shop. What they don't understand is that I bought the stuff to impress potential clients, so business related. Right? I put a cigarette through a freaking quarter, and you know what, Toby, they almost bought from us. I'm not processing this. Look, Jim needed a relaxing lunch. He has been depressed and it has been affecting his productivity. How is that not work-related? He seems fine to me. You're not his friend, you don't know. He is in love with a girl he works with who is engaged, so just cut me some slack. Please? Pam? Angela, who would you choose? Jim or Roy? It's nobody's business, Phyllis. Roy. Jim has got it bad for Pam. Oh! Which one is Pam? Well, she's Hey, Michael. So, do you think Jim will try to break up the wedding? You know what, Kevin, Jim is a friend of mine. So, the only people that this crush really concerns is Jim and Pam, and me. DWIGHT: As a volunteer sheriff's deputy, I've been doing surveillance for years. One time, I suspected an ex-girlfriend of mine of cheating on me. So I tailed her for six nights straight. Turns out, she was. With a couple of guys, actually, so Mystery solved. Jim, why didn't you tell me that you had a crush on Pam? JIM: Well, the cat's out of the bag. I used to have a crush on Pam, and now I don't. Riveting. Yeah. No, it's not. Nice. She's so hot. Hey! Hey! Did you find anything good in your desk? Uh, coupon for a free sandwich. Score! Expired in August. And my cell phone charger from two years ago. Big day. Big day. Hey, listen. Um I told Michael on the booze cruise It's so stupid. I told Michael that I had had a crush on you when you first started here. Oh. Well, I just thought that I figured you should hear it from me rather than I mean, you know Michael. Right. And, seriously, it's totally not a big deal. Okay? And when I found out that you were engaged, I mean No, I know. Like, I kind of Like I thought that maybe you did when I first started. Oh, you did? No, I mean, just 'cause we, like, got along so well. Oh, yeah. No, yeah, you saw through me. Great. So, are you gonna be, like, totally awkward around me now? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Hope that's okay. Mmm-hmm. And, Pam? It was, like, three years ago. So, I am totally over it. Cool. Okay. Stay low. This is it. There he is. He's been gone for at least two Who is that? Come to papa. (DWIGHT SNICKERING) Oh, yes. Let's roll. I knew it! (CAR APPROACHING) Oh, man! You are so busted! Ice skates, shopping bags? I think I know what's going on here. You weren't sick at all. Who is this? This is Dwight Schrute. Who is this? Gil. Are you going to tell Michael? How about this. I don't tell Michael, and in exchange, you owe me one great big, giant favor, redeemable by me at a time and place of my choosing. Guess what I found out about Oscar tonight. He was lying about being sick. Should I have reported Oscar's malfeasance? Probably, but now I know something he doesn't want me to know. So I can use his malfeasance to establish leverage. Otherwise, it's just malfeasance, for malfeasance's sake. JIM: Hey. I know. I know, I know. What happened? I Oh, just I was trying The expense reports And then Toby, you know, he just I know, I just I just hope it I just hope that this doesn't affect our friendship. It's stupid. It's so stupid. Hey, hey. Listen, man. You know, it's not a big deal. Well, okay. I'm fine. It's going to be fine. No, I know, I'm good, I'm good. It's just Look, it's one day. Everything's gonna be all right? Yeah. No big deal. You good? Yeah, I'm good. Okay. Creed, did you organize the menu book? I thought that was more on a volunteer basis. No. That was mandatory. Oh, I thought that was a volunteer thing. Hey, your schedule for next week. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Look. About you and Jim. I No. No, that's You don't have to I just feel it's my responsibility as your bosslfriend No, it's really, it's okay. I know that Jim had, like, a crush on me when he first started, but that was a long time ago, so It wasn't that long ago. It was on the booze cruise. Jim had a crush on me on the booze cruise or he told you about it on the booze cruise? Okay, shut it, Michael. I'm done, that's it. I'm out. Ready? Yeah. MICHAEL: People are always coming to me, "Michael, I have a secret. "You're the only one I trust." No thanks, because keeping a secret can only lead to trouble. Like, I was watching Cinemax last weekend, this movie. Portrait of a Prostitute, or something. Secrets of a Call More Secrets of a Call Girl. And the lead character Shyla is framed for murder, goes on the run, and winds up working at a bordello in Malibu. I don't I don't wanna live like that. I like it here. I don't wanna be Shyla, I like being Michael Scott. What? Oh, nothing. Pam's on vacation and she gets back tomorrow, so it'll be nice to see her. It'll be nice. And she set a date for the wedding with Roy. June. Summer. So, that'll be nice. And that's that. (PHONE RINGING) What? Oh, nothing. Jim's been looking at me, kind of, a lot all week. I would be creeped out by it, but it's nothing compared to the way Michael looks at me. MICHAEL: Spamster! Pam, plus Spam, plus Hamster. Right. Welcome back. How was your vacation? It was great. Yeah? Did you get lucky? (MICHAEL EXCLAIMING) Boink. Roy and I just got back from the Poconos. I get 10 vacation days a year and I try to hold off taking them for as long as possible. And this year I got to the third week in January. "I am Pam." Spicoli guy. Oh, God. Names, numbers. Okay. Whoa! God! Yuck! Yuck! Yuck! PAM: What? Yuck! Wow, what happened in there? I don't know. There is stink in there. My God. What is that? Oh, I don't know. Is that a bird? No, I don't think it's a bird. Oh, God. How could that happen? How could Right in the middle of the carpet. What's going on? Somebody vomited right in the middle of the carpet in my office. I don't think that's vomit. Check it out. KEVIN: Me? MICHAEL: Check it out. Don't be a wuss. Just get No, I'm not holding your coffee. Tell me what it is. Oh, that's ridiculous. What is it? Michael. What is it? No, just tell me what it is! Michael, I gotta get out of here. I can't hold my breath that long. PAM: Open the door up. It smelled terrible. KEVIN: Oh! MICHAEL: Jeez Oh, no I cannot believe a pipe burst and left that there. That's no burst pipe. How do you know that? What is it then? Hey, guys. Somebody making soup? Here she comes. All clean? Great. (COUGHING) It's still stinky. That is worse. She probably scrubbed it into the fibers of the carpet. Total permeation. I am a big Fear Factor fan. I'm a big fan of anything Joe Rogan does, actually. So this is sort of like my audition tape. (CLEARING THROAT) I can't stand it. I can't stay in here another second. No! Hey. Welcome back. Thanks! So, how was the resort? Did you ski a lot? A little. Good. (DOOR OPENING) What's going on in here? What? I did not do that. That sounds disgusting. It wasn't me. It wasn't me. It was not me. Oh. Wow. (PAM LAUGHING) Hey, Jim. I thought that we would be desk buddies while they changed my carpet. That might be a little difficult with the one computer. Oh, it's There's definitely a desk open in the back. Yeah. Which I guess I'll be taking. No, no, no. Seriously, I don't mind sharing. No, no, no. Seriously, I'll be in the back. Hey, Kelly. Are you moving back here? Just for the day, while Michael's at my desk. Because Toby used to sit there, but then he had to move over there because of an allergy. Allergy to the desk? Weird. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Old bullpen. The old bullpen. Don't ape me. Okay. This is great. Yeah. The pressures of my office are insane. I just You couldn't understand, but man, you guys have it easy out here. You know, I used to sit right here? No way. Yeah. And who had your office? Ed Truck. (EXCLAIMING IN DISGUST) Ed Truck was the manager before me. Horrible. He hated fun. It was like, "Oh, Ed Truck is walking toward us, so stop having fun. "Start pretending to do work." What a jerk. He's You know what? I swore to myself that if I ever got to walk around the room as manager, people would laugh when they saw me coming and would applaud as I walked away. I'm serious. My closet doors will not shut. I mean, it only takes so long to measure to make sure that clothes will hang up. 'Cause aren't all hangers, like, that big? So I don't understand why the closet engineer didn't think of that. So now I'm doing this new thing where I just leave piles of clothes on the floor and I walk around the piles to get an outfit You know who used to sit at that desk? That guy Miles, who quit to form his own company? Todd Packer. No. Yeah. I thought he was out on the road. He was, but that desk was empty. He'd come in and sit there sometimes. When I was in training, many years ago, not so long ago, I worked side-by-side with a fellow named Todd Packer. And together we rocked the office. (HAMMERING LOUDLY) MICHAEL: Packer and I once spent a whole day with our pants off. And when people noticed, we convinced them that they were crazy. I will gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today. Excuse me one second, please? What is it that you need right now that can't wait until I'm off the phone with a customer? A customer. Well, sound the alarm. (CHUCKLING) Okay. Another time, Packer held this guy's head in the toilet for like, a minute. The guy had no sense of humor about it. Probably why he wasn't hired. (GROANING) What did you hit me for? Charley horse! What? Charley horse! You shouldn't have hit me, Michael. Okay. Once, as a joke, Packer banged every chick in the office. It was hysterical. Beyonce, pink the color, Pink the person, hot dogs, basically anything that is awesome. Snow cones Hey, Jim, Michael wanted me to ask you how to raise your desk chair. It's the lever on the side. That's what I told him. Thanks. Oh, my God, he is so cute. Would you talk to him for me and see if he likes me? No, I don't think I can Oh, please, Jim. Please, please, Jim. Please, please, please, he's so cute. I like him so much. And I would do it, but I'm too shy. Please, Jim. Please, please, please. Please, Jim. Please, please, please. (WHISPERING) Dwight? Michael. Let's send up Accounting. What? Old-fashioned raid. Sales on Accounting. Yeah, follow my lead. Hey, guys. Hey, Michael. What's up? Hey, Dwight. (SCREAMING WILDLY) (LAUGHING) MICHAEL: Come on, come on, come on, come on! MICHAEL: Sales rules! DWIGHT: Yes! Yeah! Yeah! DWIGHT: Should we help them pick up their stuff? MICHAEL: No, no, no, no. We don't do that. We don't do that. Okay. Watch out, Pam. You're next. You're gonna throw my things on the ground? Maybe. OSCAR: What happened in Michael's office was wrong. I understand it. It makes sense. But it was still wrong. Why would somebody ruin a perfectly good carpet? I don't know. It could be done out of hate. It could be done out of love. It could be completely neutral. Maybe somebody hates the cleaning lady. And, well, she doesn't do a very good job, obviously, because my office still reeks like you would not believe. I hate her. You know what? I am beginning to think that what happened to my carpet was an act of terrorism against the office. The only thing that makes any sense. Hello, am I the 107th caller? Hello, Rock 107, am I the 107th caller? Hello, Rock 107, am I the 107th caller? I'm totally gonna win us that box set. Stop. Jethro Tull Stop it. Stop it. Don't. Don't. I need to make a sales call. Please? All right. Am I the 107th caller? PAM: Back so soon. ROY: We can go back. ROY: We can go back in, like, a couple of weeks maybe. Yeah, right. Okay, maybe another month, like, maybe for, like, Presidents' Day or something? Yeah, that's right. We could do a three-day weekend. I wonder if I could, like, call in sick on the Friday. Then I get a four-day weekend. (KELLY TALKING INAUDIBLY) KELLY: And when I wake up, I feel fine. But it's so weird to fall asleep. And I just hate it KELLY: 'cause I try to go to bed at, like, 9:30. PAM: Are you kidding? ROY: No. Hi, guys. We haven't finished getting things in order from your last visit. I'm just walking around. Were you? Well, yeah. It's just that we're really swamped over here, Michael. Oh, and I'm not? Why would you say that? Because I'm having fun? You guys just are working for the weekend, aren't you? I am working for the week. Sales team. Listen to me. This is what we're gonna do. I'm gonna up the ante a little bit, literally. Right here I'm gonna put a crisp $100 bill. The person with the most sales at the end of the day gets to keep the cash. Sound good? Yeah! Seventy, eighty, one, two, three. $83. Still a lot of money and I'm going to I'm gonna leave it right over here where everybody can see it. I will be taking Jim's clients today because he is not here, and out of sight. Out of the contest. Let's see who winds up with the cash, shall we? You're gonna compete against us? Oh, it is on, Phyllis. It is so on! It is so on! God, this is gonna be fun. Michael is gonna wipe the floor with us. So, you have and I will deliver those personally in a Sebring. Very good. Nice doing business with you. Thank you. Yes! Oh! Yeah. Read it and weep. Oh! Oh, look at that! Look at me, Phyllis! Oh, what is that? That's my sale! (HUMMING VICTORIOUSLY) What's that? What are you doing? Nothing. I think he's dancing. No, just That was definitely not dancing. You know what, guys? It's none of your concern. It was official business, so just DARRYL: Paper business. Yeah, paper business. Is this done? Nope. Extreme Home Makeover puts together a house in an hour. If you were on that crew, you'd be fired like that. Somebody did something bad to Michael's carpet. Maybe that's all we need to know. Who do you think did it? Are you kidding? I thought it was you. Really? I thought you. MICHAEL: This was no act of God. A person did this. A person who works in this office. Maybe all of them. You know what? Today is not a good day for a sales contest. We're not doing this today. That doesn't seem fair. You want to talk about fair? Does anyone need to smell my old carpet? You explain to me how that was fair and I'll explain to you how this is fair. Plus, I just I think that picking today was sort of taking advantage. But you're the one who picked today. I am a victim of a hate crime. Stanley knows what I'm talking about. That's not what a hate crime is. Well, I hated it a lot, okay. I You know what? If the guilty person would just come forward and take their punishment, we'd be done. Very well, then you're all punished. What's our punishment? You're all on a time out. Just sit there quietly. (PHONE RINGING) MICHAEL: No, no. Hey. What's up? Nothing much. Let me ask you something. It's actually a little awkward. What? What do you think of Kelly? I don't know. It depends if you like a little junk in She's really cool. Are you interested in her? Yeah, totally. Really? Did she say something? She said lots of things. Do you know if she's looking for a long-term thing or if she'd be cool just hanging out? I have no idea. Can you find out? Yeah. Sure. Oh, long-term, definitely. Fall in love, have babies, spend every second together. But don't tell him that, okay? Just tell him I'm, like, up for anything. I mean, I'm not a slut, but who knows? Do you remember Ed Truck? Sure. He hired me. How's he doing? How would I know? I thought you might. My biggest fear is turning into him. Michael, you should have much bigger fears than that. I wasn't talking literally, Creed. Yeah, being buried alive would be worse. Happy? Why am I talking to you? Ed? Hi, thanks for meeting me. It must be kind of neat coming back. Yeah. Shall we go upstairs? Well, honestly, Ed, I really don't want to be up there right now. So, what's the problem with my pension? Oh, no, no, no, you're good. It was clerical. You're good. Well, somebody did something in my office and I now think that they did it on purpose and it was directed at me. Well, what was done? I didn't get a good look at it, but it smells horrible. Yeah, somebody once did that in my office. Really? Yeah. Well, that figures. So, how did you deal with people not liking you? You can't expect to be friends with everybody. Well, sure I can. No. They'll always think of you as a boss first. Not necessarily. You can love a boss like you do a father. I'm not sure that ever happens. Well, okay. Different management styles. Why can't your workers be your workers, family be your family, your friends be your friends? MICHAEL: Last week I would have given a kidney to anyone in this office. I would've reached right into my stomach and pulled it out for them. But now, no. I don't have the relationship with these people that I thought I did. I hope they ask, so they can hear me say, "No. I only give my organs to my real friends. "Go get yourself a monkey kidney." Hey, Brenda, this is Jim Halpert, from the boat? And I got your number from the corporate directory, and well, I was assuming that you probably gave it to them because you wanted me to ask you out, right? So, give me a call back. You can get my number from said directory. Or just check your e-mail, 'cause I just sent you one. Yikes. Give me a call back. I hope. I'll talk to you later. Bye. You just asked a girl out on the phone. Yep. (PHONE RINGING) Yes. Hello, yes, I'm looking for a gay nerd named Michael Scott. Who is this? How did you get this number? Your mom, you gay nerd. Oh, my God. Packer. Packster. Whacky Pack, how you doing? Hey, listen, did you get that package I left for you? No. Did anybody see a package here today? No. How big was it? It was pretty big. Really? Yeah! Did you see a big package? Where did you leave it? Look in the middle of your office. Really? Guys, did you see a big package in my office? You mean, the thing? (PACKER GUFFAWING) Are you kidding me? Special delivery. That was Packer! You are dead! You are dead, my friend. That is Oh, God! Of course it was you. Sit on the throne, Michael. Yeah! Yeah! Oh, my God! It was Packer! It takes an advanced sense of humor. I don't expect everybody to understand. It was done out of love, just like I thought. It's God, these people are so These are good people. We have fun. We just have fun. Oh, I'm just so sorry that I threw the thing out. (LAUGHING) FEMALE VOICE: You have seven unheard messages. (BEEPING) Hey, Jim, it's Pam. I keep looking up to say something to you and then Michael's there and it's horrible. Anyway, I'm bored. Come back. Hey, guess what? I moved my computer so I can't see Michael's head. It's working. I think I can have a career as a very specific type of decorator. Sudoku. Level, moderate. Time, 18 minutes. Suck on that, Halpert. I'll transfer you. Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Hold, please. Dunder Mifflin, this is Okay, sorry. Michael was standing at my desk, and I needed to be busy or who knows what would have happened. So, thank you. Hey, what's that word we made up for when you have a thing stuck in your shoe? Anyway, I have a thing stuck in my shoe. Hey, I have a chance to sneak out of here early and I'm not messing this up. So, I'll see you tomorrow. Calling from my cell phone. I don't know if you guys figured out who did that to Michael's carpet yet, but I have a theory that involves an inter-departmental conspiracy. Everybody in the office. We need to talk. So, I'm happy to be here. It's very nice to see all of you. You're all looking well. Today is a "women in the workplace" thing. Jan's coming in from Corporate to talk to all the women about I don't really know what. But Michael's not allowed in. She said that about five times. Women today, though we have the same options as men, we often face a very different set of obstacles (KNOCKING ON DOOR) In getting there. So Hey, what's going on? Michael Yeah, you know what? I thought we agreed you wouldn't be here. I thought about it. I just have a few things I want to say. What are you doing? Just hear me out. What is more important than quality? Equality. Now, studies show that today's woman, the Ally McBeal Woman, as I call her, is at a crossroads. Michael And No, just You have come a long way, baby. But I just want to keep it within reason. JAN: Michael. They did this up in Albany You are not allowed in this session, okay? and they ended up turning the break room into a lactation room, which is disgusting. Now you're really not allowed in this session. Well, I'm their boss. I am your boss. Anybody want any coffee or anything? We're fine, Michael. We just need you to leave, please. MICHAEL: Women in the workplace. Yeah. Translation, I have been banned from my own conference room so that Jan can talk in secret to all the girls. Whoa, sorry. Women of the workplace. About what? I don't know. Clothes. Me. Ladies, I am so, so sorry. Can we start again? We were on such a roll. I really apologize Jan? for that. Yes, Pam? Michael's still at the door. Michael! JAN: So, one obstacle is how assertiveness is perceived differently in men and women. Men who are assertive tend to be admired. They're called Anyone? That's a terrible idea. JIM: What is? Them in there all together. They stay in there too long, they're gonna get on the same cycle. Wreak havoc on our plumbing. Everyone? Guys? Circle up, please. Come on over. Bring your chairs. Toby? Come on over. You're a guy, too. Sort of. MICHAEL: Let's do this! Well, first of all, I just want to warm up a little bit. Let's just clap. Let's just clap. Ready? Yeah! Yeah! That's what I'm talking about! Okay, I don't know what you're doing here, Michael Just having a little "guys in the workplace" thing. but it's very disruptive. Why can't boys play with dolls? Why does society force us to use urinals, when sitting down is far more comfortable? Can you please do this somewhere else, Michael? We have nowhere else, Jan. This We could do it in the warehouse. Dwight. Excellent idea. Go to the warehouse. Okay, fine. Actually, perfect. Perfect. You know what? There is another side to this place, gentlemen. And I know we all love our cushy jobs and our fun, exciting office, but do you realize that underneath us, there's another world? The warehouse world. A world that is teeming with sweat and dirt and life. Life. The bowels of the office. MICHAEL: These guys are down there, they are real men, doing real men's work. We are going to learn how a warehouse works. I think this is gonna work out great. Because managing the warehouse is a very important part of my job, and I haven't been there in months. (HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING) Remember on Lost when they met The Others? I am so sorry about that. So, where were we? Pam, are you okay taking notes, then? Please? Yeah. Thank you very much. So, let's meet the warehouse! Let's get some shots. Pan around there. This is Darryl. One of our warehouse staff. Darryl, what is your biggest fear? My biggest fear is that someone will distract us from getting all the shipments out on time. You know what? Darryl is actually the foreman here, and not Roy, which is cool. There's Roy, riding the big rig. So, Roy is actually going to be marrying Pam sometime this summer. And she's our receptionist. Sort of a "Brangelina" thing. Why? "Brangelina" is the Brad Pitt and Angelina. I don't understand. Roy Roy and Pam. It's a "Ram." It's a "Ram" thing. I bet Roy heard about you liking Pam. I bet he'll try to beat you up. Thanks for the heads up, Kev. I got your back, if he does. But try to stay out of it. Just in case there's somebody down here who shouldn't be. A little Good Will Hunting situation. All right. Troops. This is an important day, a big day. Now, you may look around and see two groups here. White collar, blue collar. But I don't see it that way. And you know why not? Because I am collar-blind. Why don't we go around the table and all say something that we know we're good at? I will start. I am good at public speaking. Hi. I'm Meredith, and I'm an Good at supplier relations. JAN: Great! Phyllis? I'm good at computer stuff. E-mails, spreadsheets. All that. Really? I don't know. I thought that JAN: No. Okay. Stop. PHYLLIS: You know, I've seen some of your spreadsheets, and I almost always Really? I thought they were pretty I don't know how I fit in with these women here, or with Jan. I mean, we get along great. Fine. I guess the person I have the most in common with is Jim Halpert! Hey, I, you know, heard there's a rumor going around about you used to have a crush on Pam and Oh, no, no. No, no, it's cool, 'cause I know you're a good guy, and I know that that crush ended a long time ago. So, you know, we're cool. All right? Yeah. No, yeah. Definitely. You know, it's great with me. 'Cause that way I'm glad she has a friend at work she can get through the day with. Oh. And then she's not all "bap, bap, bap, bap," you know, when she gets home. Yeah. I like talking to her, too. So, we're cool, right? Yes. Yeah. Yup. Cool, man. Good. All right. Sweet. Hey, Mike, look. How about we go upstairs, too? You know, learn how an office works. Oh, well. We can both switch places for the day. Okay. Yeah. You know what? I don't You Your My job sucks compared to this. I don't think you'd like it up there. An experience Guys! Want to start unloading the truck? Okay. Let's go. Step up. Check this out. Look at that. Look at that. Hello, how are Okay. That's great. That is good stuff. In five years, I'd like to be five years sober. That is an excellent goal. Four and a half. I'll tell you one thing. I am not gonna be one of those women schlepping her kids around in a minivan. JAN: Great. I want an SUV with three rows of seats. WOMAN: That would be great. I'll be honest. One of the goals of these women's seminars is to feel out if there's any standouts, women who could be a valuable addition to our corporate life. Michael wants us to bond, so we need topics for conversation. Ponies. No. How about rainbows? No. Flowers. No! That's dangerous, Mike. Come on, get down off the lift. Hey, you're gonna hurt yourself. Mike! Stand clear. Mike, get off of the lift. Please! Come on, now. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. Look, would you Look We'll get somebody to clean that up. We're the ones that gotta clean that up! Damn it, Michael! MICHAEL: We have to have this thing serviced. So, guys' gripe session. Here we are. Now, we definitely live in different worlds, but we have a lot in common. We even like the same girls, some of us. And that's gonna happen. You know, we're guys, so Hey, do you want me to go? No, why would I? You can I'll go. stay, or And a big walk-in closet. Oh, that's part of my dream, too. KELLY: Oh, me, too. Great. Great. And, Pam? What about you? What is your dream? Well, I always dreamed of a house with a terrace upstairs. Plant flowers on it, stuff like that. Since I was a girl. More seriously, though, a husband that I love. Roy. And I love to draw. And I did a little in college, and I'd still love to do something where I could work with art or graphic design in some way. She's real good. Thanks. You know, the company is offering a design training program in New York. Well, I have a job right now. So, I can't really take time off. Well, it's only on weekends. And then a few weeks in New York, but I'm sure that I could ask Corporate to help you out. Well, it's just that the weekends aren't good because There are always a million reasons not to do something. Let's start with the warehouse. What bothers you as guys? You know? My priority is safety. Okay. So it really bothers me when somebody comes in here, speeding around on the lift, playing with it like a toy. It kind of gets under my skin. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Don't shush me. No, that was just That bothers me, too. I was breathing. Pam shushes me. It drives me crazy. I hate shushing. You know, that's the thing. What Okay. What is our beef, as human men? You know, that's a good question, Hasselhoff. Okay. All right. LONNY: What bugs us? Good. Guys ragging on each other. That's what guys do, and we love it. All right. Let's talk about clothing. I'm excited about today. I love girl talk. Dress for the job you want, not the job you have. All right, you can use your clothing to send a message about your ambitions by wearing clothes that reflect what you aspire to be. I'm not gaining anything from this seminar. I'm a professional woman, the head of Accounting. I'm in the healthiest relationship of my life. I just think it's insulting that Jan thinks we need this. And apparently, judging from her outfit, Jan aspires to be a whore. I hate it when girls insist on taking them out to new restaurants every weekend night, and then they're like, "When are we gonna go on a date-date?" I hate that, too! I hate that, too! That sucks so hard. It totally sucks! Yeah, and then they make you drive them to church the next morning. Like, gas ain't free. Yeah, on our salaries, man. What do they expect? You know, "Take us out every weekend," you know what I mean? MICHAEL: I feel you, man. We're not millionaires. I feel you. No, you don't. You don't feel us. How can you? You know what? Not literally. You say we're the same, but we get compensated very differently. Yes. We work the same hours as you, and you just said we work a lot harder. You do. So But we get paid a lot less. Word. Like, next to no benefits. MICHAEL: I know. God, what is that? Exactly. It blows. It blows, man! You know, this would not happen if we had a union. That's what I'm talking about. Absolutely, that's what we need to do. You're right. See, that's what I've been saying, man. We need to do this, finally. You know what, is that necessary? 'Cause you already, sort of, have a union of guys. It's more than necessary, Mike. We need this. Roy? Yeah? Do you still have that card from the dockworkers' union? Dockworkers? In my truck. Come on, man. Yeah. MICHAEL: You know what? I think our problem is the chicks. The problem is the chicks. Union! Yeah! And you gotta blame them. Are you with us, Mike? Yeah Welcome to the warehouse. Michael! Michael! Michael! Michael! Another issue is inequality of pay between men and women. (KNOCKING AT DOOR) I'm sure that all of you have dealt with that before. This is important. Ladies, take a breather. Jan, I wanted Can I help you? I wanted to say that the guys downstairs are thinking about forming a union, and they have some good points. What? A union? Don't get hysterical. I'm not. Part of my job is knowing how to talk to women. Let's be rational here. What are the pros? What are the cons? The cons are that everyone will lose their job, Michael. Everyone. Office, warehouse What do you think the pros are here? Don't talk to me that way, please. Just They're gonna want to hear this from you. You got yourself into this, Michael, so We're bonding down there. you get yourself out of it. That's too bad. I just don't want to have to tell them something they're not gonna want to hear. Now who's getting hysterical? Okay. Come on, Jan. After all we've been through Michael, Michael We have a history. We have a history between us. Michael. Don't say another word. Get yourself downstairs. I'm just saying that we have something. Okay. Whatever. You know what? We could get this done a lot quicker if we formed a type of assembly line. This here is a "run out the clock" situation. Just like upstairs. Sports metaphors are one of the ways women feel left out of the language of the office. Now, I know this might sound silly, but many women ask to go over it, so, "fumble" means Mistake. Slip. Right. "Par for the course" is a golf term. It means "right on track." "Below par" means "worse." Wait. That should mean better. That doesn't make sense. What about "second base"? Like, if Michael said he got to second base with you, does that mean you, like, closed a deal? Excuse me? I mean, that's a baseball term, right? I don't know what Michael was talking about. I don't know. KELLY: Like, you went to Chili's, and he got to second base with you. Excuse me. Kelly, I don't know what Michael was talking about. He just told everybody, and I just want to know if that's Hey. Hey. How's it going down there? It's a complete Well, actually, it's exactly what you'd expect, so How are the girls? Good. We watched a video about our changing bodies. Did you really? No. Oh. (CHUCKLING) Almost. But, hey, something kind of cool, there's this internship in graphic design that Jan was telling us about. She made it sound, like, really great. Nice! Well, what's it all about? I think you should do it. That's great! It's really cool. Cold front coming into the warehouse! Better put on your ski boots! (MICHAEL CHEERING) Happy New Year, Darryl. Hey, Darryl. You ever done this? Are you married? I'm divorced. That must have been hard. It was, yes. You were probably feeling really depressed and sad, and that's why you did that thing with Michael. I think you should all spend a little more time thinking about your careers, and less time on personal stuff. I think we're all okay with the balance we've struck. ANGELA: At least you don't have kids. You have no kids, right? Thank God. Okay. Let's take five. I think we could all use five. How can someone so beautiful be so sad? Hi. Did you take care of the situation? Yeah. Yeah. Yes. I have Excuse me. Excuse me. essentially, yes, I have taken I'm told that there has been some interest in forming a union, and that Michael supported it. Obviously, he's not a friend of yours, because he didn't tell you the facts. So, let me. If there is even a whiff of unionizing in this branch, I can guarantee you the branch will be shut down like that. They unionized in Pittsfield, and we all know what happened in Pittsfield. It will cost each of you a fortune in legal fees and union dues, and that will be nothing compared to the cost of losing your jobs. So I would think long and hard before sacrificing your savings and your futures just to send a message. If you have any further questions, you can direct them to To Michael. PAM: Dreams are just that. They're dreams. They help get you through the day. Like the thing about the terrace. It's nice, but, I don't know, it was just something I read in this book when I was 12. The girl in the book has a terrace outside of her bedroom, and she planted flowers on it, and I just loved that. It just always kind of stuck with me. So, you're not doing it. How did you know? Why not? It's just, like No big reason. Just a bunch of little reasons. Come on. Roy's right. There's no guarantee it's gonna lead to anything, anyway. Roy said that? What? You have something you want to say? You gotta take a chance on something, sometime, Pam. I mean, do you want to be a receptionist here, always? Oh, excuse me, I'm fine with my choices. You are? Yeah. It's impractical. I'm not gonna try to get a house like that. They don't even make houses like that in Scranton. So, I'm never gonna I'm just gonna put this over there. This is not a good idea, right here. Easy does it. Okay. Pizza. Great equalizer. Rich people love pizza. Poor people love pizza. White people love pizza. Black people love pizza. Do black people like pizza? Hey. Look, guys, I'm sorry. Sometimes Jan can be such a bitch. Yeah. Yeah. Hey, watch it. Watch it. We have a relationship. Thank you to our hosts. DARRYL: Hey, Michael! This ain't over. (SIGHING) Excellent. Is it good to be back? Yeah. I mean, I love the guy stuff, but to run an office, you need men and women. You know why? Because you need to have that crazy sexual tension to keep things interesting. (PHONE RINGING) Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Hold, please. Snow angels. Snow angels. (PHONE RINGING) I really like Valentine's Day in this office. It's kind of like grade school. Everybody gives out little presents and stuff. Like, last year, Jim gave me this card with Dwight's head on it. It was horrifying and funny and (DOOR OPENS) Phyllis. MAN: You could just sign here. PAM: Roy and I are saving for the wedding. So I made him promise not to get me anything too big. "Happy Valentine's Day, darling. Love, Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration." Isn't he sweet? Oh, yeah. Wow. All right, Dwight, as you know I'm heading to New York today, doing a presentation on the branch to the new CFO. And you want me to come with you. No. The opposite of that. I will stay here and run things on this end. Very good. Question: Will you be seeing Jan when you're in New York? I probably will. Why do you ask? Well, it's Valentine's Day. And you guys, you know Well. screwed. What is your problem? This is a business trip. I would have to be a raving lunatic to try to talk to Jan about what happened between us. Her words, not mine. She sent me an e-mail this morning. But it is Valentine's Day. It's New York. The City of Love. Hey, Pam. You heart NY, right? You want me to pick you up anything? That's okay. All right. The best present would be, you do a good job in front of the new CFO. Dude. I'm going to nail it. Me in New York? Oh, I own that city. "Forget about it!" See you. Well, here we go, on our way to New York. New York, New York. The city so nice, they named it twice. Manhattan is the other name. JIM: So, I broke up with Katy and I haven't been dating anybody else. So, this year I don't have to worry about Valentine's Day. It's going to be good. I invited a couple of friends over. We're gonna play some cards and I'll end up winning a lot of money, because they're idiots. It's gonna be great. What's this? What is this? I don't know. It's on your desk. Yeah, but who put it here? And for what purpose? It was there when I sat down. "Happy Valentine's Day." It's me. I'm the Bobble Head. Yes! (EXCLAIMS) The meeting isn't till 3:00. But I always like to come to New York a little bit early, and hit some of my favorite haunts. Like right here is my favorite New York pizza joint. And I'm going to go get me a New York slice. Hey, Kelly, what's up? Nothing. Oh! Except Oh, my God, Jim. Last night, Ryan and I totally, finally hooked up. It was awesome. That's great. I'm really happy for you. I know, and it was so funny. 'Cause we were at this bar with his friends, and I was sitting next to him the whole night, and he wasn't making a move. So in my head I was like, "Ryan, what's taking you so long?" And then he kissed me. And I didn't know what to say. Wow. So I said," Ryan, what took you so long?" I mean, I just said it to him. Can you believe that? Wow. Oh, my God, Jim, is that embarrassing? I'm embarrassed. No. Don't be. Oh, thank God, because I was nervous, Jim. No. All right You will not believe I was so nervous. I bet. But now Now I have a boyfriend. All right. I hooked up with her on February 13th. Here it is. The heart of New York City, Times Square. Named for the good times you have when you're in it. Most people, when they come to New York, they go straight to the Empire State Building. That's pretty touristy. I come here. Great places to eat. We have Bubba Gump shrimp, Red Lobster down there. You know This is the heart of civilization, right here. (EXCLAIMING) Guess what. Really? It's from Bob, again. That's great. Everybody takes the subway in New York. It's fast. It's efficient. Gets you there on time. It's a way to Okay, there's a guy pooping in a cardboard box down there. This is the world-famous Rockefeller Center, founded, of course, by Theodore Rockefeller. This is the skating rink. And I think the Rangers practice there sometimes. And it's That's Tina Fey. That's Tina Fey from Saturday Night Live. (CLEARS THROAT) Hello. Hello. Hi. Oh, I'm I'm sorry. I thought you were Okay. I thought that was She looked like She looked a lot like Tina Fey. Hello, hello. I thought that was Tina Fey, but it wasn't. So Are you serious? He was here? When? When I was talking to the fake Tina Fey? Come on! Are you serious? Hello, Angela, did you hear? Somebody totally rocked the house and got me the best present I've ever gotten. Really? I wouldn't know anything about that. But I'm glad you enjoyed it. Oh, I did. I did. I didn't get anything for Valentine's Day. Oh, I bet you will, before the day is over. Really? Well, I hope I do. MICHAEL: I would love to live in New York someday. It's a big dream of mine. Work at Corporate with Jan. That would be awesome. Go to Broadway shows, eat hot dogs. Scranton is great, but New York is like Scranton on acid. No, on speed. No, on steroids. Okay, um I think, that's either the Hudson or the East, so we're back Should be back this way. MICHAEL: There's a lot of pressure on me right now. It's like Michael Jordan in the NBA finals, or like Stormin' Norman Schwarzkopf. And this presentation is Desert Storm. And as soon as it's over, we will not have to deal with those Iraqis anymore. Let's do it. No, that's all right. Spend money on her instead of giving it to us, that's fine. No. I didn't even have a seat for you anyway. Yeah. All right, man. Okay, have a good night. Bye. Phyllis Lapin? Holy God. It's from Bob. Man, that thing's bigger than I am. No, it's not. Oh, zip it. Wow. There they are. What's up? Hey. Hey, hey. Michael Scott. Josh Porter. High five. Bam. All right. You know Dan Gore, from Buffalo? Yeah, how you doing? Nobody needs to introduce this guy. Craiggers. What's up, buddy? You have been kicked out of every strip club in Albany, is that true? Guilty, yeah. Well So, what's going on? What'd I miss? Not much. They're, I guess, running late upstairs. We're just waiting for the presentations. Cool, good, good. Good. Give us some time to catch up and Pam. Hi, how're you doing? Good. Listen, may I speak with you, privately? You can't fire me, Dwight, just 'cause Michael's not here. No, Pam, just I'm Just Please. You need to get something for your girlfriend? Girlfriend, yes. And the reason I didn't get anything for this particular person, who shall remain nameless, is that she's not really the kind of person you'd think would be into Valentine's Day. She's kind of Tightly wound? Exactly. Okay. Well, sometimes the gift is really about the gesture, you know, like, what it means instead of what it is. You mean, like a ham? No, not like a ham. It's about doing something, so that the person knows that you really care about her, that you remember her. Okay, I get it. That's great. Okay, shut up. I know exactly what to do. What about you, Craig? Did you lose anyone? Oh, man. Jan called me in September, and she's like, "You gotta fire four people," and I was just like, "What?" You know. Did you? No. I just ignored her. She is the worst. Well, she is our boss, so She ain't my boss, dude. I don't work for that bitch. Hey, come on, you know, that's not What? Cool it. You like Jan? How can you like Jan? Maybe because she's my girlfriend. Was. Or not my girlfriend. She We hooked up and You hooked up with Jan? It's just, you know, it was months ago. Just It was just once. It was, God, just stupid. Just Just forget it. Yeah, let's change the subject. Yeah, yeah. I don't know what he's thinking, but I would just be so psyched if we just dated forever. Well, I'd take it slow. 'Cause it seems like a lot of the time, things like that need to Soda. Cool. Hey, so, do you want to do something tonight, or Oh, no, not while I'm here. I mean, I know that it's Valentine's Day or whatever. But there's totally no pressure at all of any kind whatsoever. So I can't tonight. I have plans with my friends. Okay, that's cool. Okay. I completely understand. Cool. Okay. Josh Porter, Stamford. David. Nice to meet you. And Michael Scott, Scranton. Nice to meet you. Ditto. How are you, Jan? Fine, Michael, thank you. Okay. So, we are in the process of doing a complete review of the company's financial strength. All I'd like to do today is to hear you JAN: Nervous? No, I'm not nervous. Well, I mean, I guess I'd be lying if I didn't say I was a little nervous. The new CFO is judging me on this, too. And, well, it is Michael, so Yeah. I am very nervous. So, with the 12 new local accounts, we had a total of four percent organic growth, which was just above our pre-year targets. Thanks very much. Thank you. Okay, Michael. (CLEARS THROAT) What is a business? Is it a collection of numbers and sales reports? Sure. But, as you know, David, and Jan, it is much more. MICHAEL: Life moves a little slower in Scranton, Pennsylvania. And that's the way we like it. Because at Dunder Mifflin, Scranton, we're not just in the paper business. We're in the people business. Let's meet some of the folks who make the Scranton branch so special. This is Stanley Hudson, one of our talented salesmen. An African-American father of two, Stanley's dedication is no doubt one of the hallmarks of the foundation of the business we're hoping to build our basis on. MICHAEL: Yeah, I shot a bunch of footage around the office, edited it together on my Mac. Was thinking about entering it in some festivals. Probably won't. You know, not what this is about, but MICHAEL: And finally, Pam Beesly. Look at her. Look how cute. Not bad at all. As the receptionist, Pam is truly the gateway to our world. Well, I hope this gave you a little taste of what life is like here at Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. What it's like to walk a mile in Oscar's shoes, or try on Phyllis' pants. Next time you're in town, give us a call. Stop on by. I'm sure you'll be greeted by a big smile, and a "How're you doing, pal?" Maybe even one of Angela's famous brownies. And you'll know that you're home. MALE VOICE: Great Scott! Questions? Wow. Okay. Okay, thank you, Michael, that was great. Yes, thank you. But for right now, what I'd really like to know about is the branch's performance. So, do you have that information as well? Yes. Absolutely, David. Let me get that for you. I Can you sign? Yeah. Oscar. Nothing for me? Join the club. Who's it from? My mom. It's frustrating, 'cause we'd be so perfect together. You know what? Here's the deal, Kelly. It would be really nice if he was into you, right? It'd be great. But he isn't. So Yeah, but it would be so great if he was. Well, he's not, though. So you just gotta suck it up. You just gotta move on, try to have some fun. Come to my poker game tonight. Okay, cool. Is it okay if I invite Ryan? And that about does it, thank you. Okay. Craig. Yeah, here's the deal. I did not understand that this was supposed to be a full-on, like, report or whatnot. I'm sorry, what did you think financial presentation meant? I was under the impression this was more of, like, a meet-and-greet type deal. So, does that mean that you don't have the numbers on your branch? That is correct. Yes. Craig, you realize that we're trying to decide whether drastic steps need to be taken. Look, I'm sorry. I didn't know. Well, the point is, that this doesn't exactly bode well for your branch. Oh, man. You know what? Michael made that stupid movie, he doesn't get in any trouble. Maybe I should have slept with you, too. Okay, okay. All right, this No, no, no. I'm not I'm not I just I just don't know what to do anymore, Michael. I mean, I'm probably gonna get fired. No, you're not. Yeah, I Michael, the CFO thinks that we slept together. Don't you understand? People get fired for much less. And I just can't believe that you told everybody. And we didn't even sleep together. Technically, we fell asleep in the same bed. So Oh, God. Michael, it was months ago. It was once. It's over. Do you understand? Yes, I'm sorry. I'll fix it. I will talk to him. I'll talk to David. Surely, you cannot be serious. I am serious. "And don't call me Shirley." Airplane! DWIGHT: Women are like wolves. If you want a wolf, you have to trap it. You have to snare it. And then you have to tame it. Keep it happy. Care for it. Feed it. Lovingly. The way an animal deserves to be loved. And my animal deserves a lot of loving. Hey, babe. Hey. You almost ready to go? I guess. Yeah. What's wrong? Nothing. It's just that I had to sit here all day while Phyllis got, like, an entire garden delivered to her. What? You're mad at me? I mean, I know that we said, "No big gifts," but I was, kind of, hoping you'd get me something for Valentine's Day. Well, Valentine's Day isn't over. Let's get you home and you are gonna get the best sex of your life. You understand this is a very serious situation. No, no, no, no, no. Yes, I Okay, well All right, here's the deal. This is my fault, this is totally on me. Before you guys came in, I was talking to the guys. We were all chatting and I made a joke, a really dumb joke, and Craig, the idiot, took it seriously. You made a joke? I did. It was stupid. And Craig, you saw him, he's not the sharpest tool in the shed. Although he is a tool. Well, I don't need to explain to you that even a joke about sexual relations with your boss I know. It was borderline at best. And Jan is a fantastic executive and has all the integrity in the world and I'm really sorry, and that will never happen again. That's fine. Let's just Just forget it. Okay. Good. Heading out? Yeah. All right, Beesly. Hey, Happy Valentine's Day. Bye. Good night, Pam. Night, Phyllis. JAN: Michael. Thank you again for that, really. It was very nice. Oh, no big deal. Really, sorry again. Oh, no, it's okay. Yeah, it's okay. So Happy Valentine's Day. Yeah, Happy Valentine's Day. Okay. (EXCLAIMING) (SPEAKING YIDDISH)   Let's think this through. If we ask corporate for that, then They are either gonna say yes or no. MICHAEL: Could go either way. We don't know what they are going to say. Think it through! We have to think it through! Because, if they say no Can we not? No Yes, we have to. You know why? 'Cause I don't like to be cooped up in that office. In that box, all day long. Heisman! Because I need to think, okay, Jim? Oh, Kevin! Ooh! (MICHAEL LAUGHING) Nice catch. (EXCLAIMING) Oscar! Intercepted. Right here. Give it to me. Sorry about that. Phyllis, give me the ball. Okay, give me the ball. Give me MICHAEL: You guys Oh, cool. Creed, give me the ball, right now. Give it to me. Ryan. (SHOUTING) DWIGHT: Fumble! (GRUNTING) MICHAEL: Listen All right, hey, Dwight Whoa! DWIGHT: Hike. MICHAEL: You all right, Ryan? Ryan? Yeah. Pam! Oh, they're having a sale on TiVo. Maybe I should get a TiVo. DVD burner. Maybe I should get one of those. You are so lucky, Jim. You're so lucky you don't have this problem. What was the ninth-place prize again? A loaf of bread? A Cugino's Pizza. Oh, great. Tasty, terrific pizza. Question: Do their pizzas play DVDs? JIM: Dwight was the top salesman of the year at our company. He wins a little prize money and gets honored at some convention. It is literally the highest possible honor that a Northeastern Pennsylvania-based mid-sized paper company regional salesman can attain. So What did I do to deserve this? PAM: Are you sad that Dwight beat you? No. Are you gonna cry, Jim? Do you need a tissue? Hey. I heard you got a wedding dress. Do you have pictures? PAM: Oh, I Yeah. I'll show them to you later. Oh, I should get back. Talk to you guys later. Okay, cool. I have a ton of stuff to do for the wedding. And I have to do it in the office. And that can be kind of awkward. Just because people can get all weird about wedding stuff and I just I don't want to offend Angela or someone. That's what she said. I don't get it. Grapes, seductive. So, you ready for the big speech this afternoon? Well, it's not really a big speech. You're still coming, right? Oh, abso-fruitly. Fruit, grapes. Nailed the joke. Matter of time. And yes, it is a big speech. Biggest of your life. Speaker at the sales convention. Been there, done that. Went there again, did it again. Two years in a row. Consecutive. I just I miss the feeling of knowing that you did a good job because somebody gives you proof of it. "Sir, you're awesome. Here's a plaque. "What, a whole year has gone by and you need more proof? "Here's a certificate." They stopped making plaques that year. What if I give a really long, extended thank you, for instance, "Thank you, Mr. Blank. Thank you very, very, very" That would look terrible. These are mostly salesmen, and salesmen expect to be entertained and you are the main act. When I was in the sixth grade, I was a finalist in our school spelling bee. It was me against Raj Patel. And I misspelled in front of the entire school the word "failure." I can't do this. That's because you're incapable of doing it, because you don't know how, because you have no skills. Dwight, there's no way I can possibly teach you what you need to know about public speaking by speech time. Oh, okay. But I can teach you enough so that you don't embarrass me or the company. Okay, deal. I'll do whatever you say, no questions asked. Well, if you have a question, you should ask me. I'll try and think of one. When Don't try to think of a question to humor me. Just try not to be such an idiot. Is that an insult, or is that part of the public speaking advice? Insult. PAM: Mom, I'm sorry, I know you and Dad are chipping in for the wedding but I do not want orange invitations. Yes. Well, if you really want my opinion JIM: Hi, yeah, can I talk to one of your travel agents? I'm gonna take a trip. I'm gonna get out of town for a while, and go someplace not here. Where do I want to go? That is an excellent question. And one I probably should have thought about before I called you. OSCAR: I get here early every morning so I can set the thermostat. I like it a little cooler, around 66 degrees. I'm more productive. Maybe some people don't like it as cold as I do. But I don't care. But seriously, what's the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman? A saleswoman has a vagina. It's a joke, Dwight, it's not a sex ed class. But I'm right. Yeah, you're right about the difference between a man and a woman, but not about the punch line to the joke. All right? The difference between a salesman and a saleswoman is boobs. Hey, do you remember the speeches that you gave? I do, both of them. Could I have a copy of one of them? No, no, they would remember. Look, it doesn't matter what you say, it just matters that you're saying something that people care about. You know? All right, here we go. Watch this. Attention, everybody! Attention, please! I have some very great news from corporate. We had a wonderful quarter. And as a result, all of you are getting bonuses for $1,000. Yeah! MICHAEL: Congratulations. PHYLLIS: Unbelievable. OSCAR: It's great. PAM: Wow. You see that? You see how they responded to me? That's amazing. In that moment, I had them. That is so great about the bonus. No, no, it's not true. I was just talking. So just go out there and say anything. They'll eat it up, they're a great audience. Go ahead, get the wallpaper. Wallpaper the ceiling if you want Excuse me! May I have your attention, please? There has been an accident on 84 West. Cars have skidded off the road into the safety railing. Several cars have flipped, there is broken glass everywhere, several people are injured. Do we know anyone who was in the accident? Brad Pitt. Also, there will be no bonuses. Why would this affect our bonuses? They're unrelated. Is Brad okay? He will never act again. Also, this branch is closing. What the hell's going on here? Are we out of jobs? Yes. KELLY: This is karma because of what he did to Jennifer Aniston. He was kidding! Dwight was kidding and I don't know why because it wasn't funny and it was just horrible STANLEY: Michael? Yeah? You said we were getting bonuses. All right, everybody in the conference room now. Let's go. Let's do it! STANLEY: Cancel the wallpaper. As your leader and your friend, I sort of demand that you can all speak in public as I can, and did, twice. You saw the plaque, right? All right, we're all gonna go around the room, and we're going to make toasts. And that way, we will overcome our fear of public speaking. You mean toastmasters? MICHAEL: Pam! I'm public speaking, stop public interrupting me! Actually, this would be good practice for your wedding toast. Yeah, the bride doesn't really do Have you ever been to a wedding? JIM: Can I go? Yes, good. Jim taking the initiative. So, I am going on a trip. But I'm not really sure where I'm going yet. It's kind of open-ended. So, I was hoping maybe you guys would have some suggestions. You should go to Hedonism. What is that? It's like Club Med, but everything is naked. I was thinking more like Europe or something like that, but good second choice. TOBY: I've been to Amsterdam. Oh, okay, you know what? That's not a toast, you're not standing up. To Amsterdam. When did you go there? After my divorce. JIM: Really? Yeah. JIM: For, like, how long? About a week, or maybe a month. I can't Jimmy, listen to me, you do not wanna go to Amsterdam, trust me. Where do I wanna go? I'd send you to Hong Kong. I'd like to say hi to my friends in China. (SPEAKING IN MANDARIN) Okay. Dwight, show us what you have learned today. Good morning, Vietnam! ALL: Oh, God. Okay, you know what, this isn't working, because I'm not nervous in front of them. They're my subordinates. No, we're not. Yes, you are. I'm assistant regional manager. Which means absolutely nothing. Michael, can you explain? Well, it's mostly made up. So MICHAEL: Dwight is not going to do a good job. It's sad. And they're expecting excellence, because I did do such a good job. Two years in a row, I killed. It was amazing. Confidence, Dwight! Dwight. If you could travel anywhere in the world, where would you go? I can travel anywhere except Cuba, and I will travel to New Zealand and walk The Lord of the Rings trail to Mordor, and then I will hike Mount Doom. So now, just leave me alone. Okay. I was just trying to get some advice on my trip. Oh, please. You're not taking any trip. You know, I majored in Public Speaking in college. You did? Mmm-hmm. And the first thing that they teach you is that you've gotta be true to yourself. And you are all about authority. Yes. I am. The great speakers throughout history were not joke tellers, they were people of passion. So, if you wanna do well today, you gotta do what they did. Which is? You've gotta wave your arms, and you've gotta pound your fists many times. You're supposed to emphasize your point. Okay, I didn't actually major in Public Speaking. But I did download speeches from some of history's famous dictators. Like this one, originally given by Benito Mussolini. Okay, look, I know you're giving this speech on your own, but I wrote up a few talking points for you to take a look at. I hope you don't mind. I'll glance at it. It's time, Dwight, the Grim Reaper is here. The very best of luck to you, Dwight. Thank you, Angela. Why'd you pick the V.A. For the reception? Roy has a connection. It's nicer than you think. You're inviting Jim? Of course, he's one of my closest friends. DWIGHT: All right. You ready? Here we go. Wow. It's a little bit bigger than I remember. MICHAEL: Come on. We're down here in the front. You all ready for this? (DANCE MUSIC PLAYING) I am just feeling under the weather, and I think that I will go home and rest. I've never, ever seen you take a sick day. Well, I've seen you take enough for the both of us. Next, I'd like to introduce the Dunder Mifflin salesman of the year, Dwight Schrute! (WHISPERING) Dwight, they called your name. Dwight, how we doing? No. I can't. Okay, you know what? I can't. You know what? Okay no, no problem. You are lucky you have me here. I'm going to cover for you. All right! Good morning, Vietnam! I am not Dwight Schrute, not at all. I am Michael Scott, his mentor and boss. And until Dwight comes up, if he ever does, I wanted to say a few words about excellence. What makes a work environment excellent? Well, there are many things, I believe, that do such a thing of that nature. And one would be humor. What is the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman? I always set it at 69. Maybe we'll use a DJ. That's the one thing Roy is in charge of for this wedding, but all he's managed to do is set a date. But he did a great job. June 10th is perfect. I want a June wedding. I've always wanted one. Ryan, do you know when you would want to get married? Actually, I don't see ever getting married. Ryan, you should be more sensitive. It's obvious she likes you and comments like that, they just I know what I said. I'm very sorry, I did not know that you were wearing a hearing aid, and I just thought you were speaking abnormally. And now, the black guy from the Police Academy movies, a robot. (MIMICKING ROBOT) Michael Winslow. Anyone? Car starting. (MIMICKING CAR ENGINE REVVING) All right, Dwight Schrute, everyone. Good luck, that is a tough crowd. (BREATHING HEAVILY) (DWIGHT CLEARING THROAT) Blood alone moves the wheels of history! Have you ever asked yourselves in an hour of meditation, which everyone finds during the day, how long we have been striving for greatness? Not only the years we've been at war, the war of work, but from the moment, as a child, when we realized that the world could be conquered. It has been a lifetime struggle, a never-ending fight! I say to you, and you will understand, that it is a privilege to fight! We are warriors! Salesmen of Northeastern Pennsylvania, I ask you, once more rise and be worthy of this historical hour! Yeah! Yeah! I've got a timeshare in Key West that might be available. Maybe. Thanks. You really think you're gonna go? Yeah, I'm definitely going. Nice. Send me a postcard. RYAN: Jim has worked at the same place for five years. Jim eats the same ham and cheese sandwich every day for lunch. I don't know, if I were a betting man, I'd say he will have a fun weekend in Philadelphia. No revolution is worth anything unless it can defend itself! DWIGHT: Some people will tell you "salesman" is a bad word. They'll conjure up images of used car dealers and door-to-door charlatans. This is our duty to change their perception. I say, salesmen and women of the world, unite! We must never acquiesce, for it is together Together that we prevail! We must never cede control of the motherland! For it is ALL: Together that we prevail! Australia? I have always wanted to go there. I'm going. I'm a little nervous to run into Dwight on his connecting flight to Mordor, but, other than that Yeah, I bought the ticket, non-refundable. That's awesome. Where are you staying? I don't know. I feel like I have plenty of time to figure out the details, but When are you leaving? I'm leaving on June 8th. Yeah. And I'm really sorry about that. I just Yeah, that's too bad. Yeah. Do you want me to take these on my way out? It's okay. I got it. All right. Okay, thanks. There you are. What happened? I got thirsty. How'd it go? It was amazing. I wish you would have been there. You would not believe what happened here. What? Something happened? This woman came in, sat down, ordered a drink. The bartender asked for her ID, which I thought was odd, because I pegged her at, like, 35. Weird. Yeah, really weird. So, she's like, "I don't have my ID, please give me one." And he's, like, "I can't do that. I can't serve you." Con artist. She might have been. So she says, "Fine. I will go to my room, I will get my purse, "I will come back, I'll show you my ID." She hasn't come back yet. She's probably in the room, drinking from the mini bar. MICHAEL: Right? MICHAEL: Dwight gave a great speech. That's the word on the street, anyway. And I entertained Dwight to no end with my bar story. So I captivated the guy who captivated a thousand guys. Can you believe that? A thousand guys. PAM: I am actually looking forward to "Take Your Daughter to Work Day." I am not great with kids, but I wanna get better because I'm getting married. So I put out a bunch of extra candy on my desk so the kids will come talk to me. Like the witch in Hansel and Gretel. Bribery. Nice. Oh, I have more. Name's Pam. Miss Beesly, if you're nasty. Janet Jackson. Hey, you having a wardrobe malfunction there Michael, you can't be nasty today. Because of that. Oh, God. Is that today? I reminded you last night. Listen, I like kids. But this is not a kids' environment. This is like HBO. No limits. MICHAEL: Who knows what I'm gonna say? Crazy stuff. And it is "R" rated. It is not rated "G." I am like Eddie Murphy in Raw. And they are trying to make me into Eddie Murphy in Daddy Day Care. Both great movies, but still. Well, I'll be in my office. Don't you think you should say something? They're cool. Michael, I think that as the boss you should really Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine. Hi, children. I'm Michael Scott and I am in charge of this place. (MUTTERING) How do I make you understand I am like Superman. And the people who work here are like citizens of Gotham City. That's Batman. That's Batman. Okay. I'm Aquaman. Where does he live, guys? The ocean. I work with a bunch of nerds. (DOOR SLAMMING) Hello, tiny one. Come on. You are the future. This is my file cabinet. Oh, this is the partition between my desk and Angela's. Abby's my fiancee Stacey's daughter. I think she'll have a good time. I just hope she doesn't look on my computer. Actually, I better go check. Michael, you remember my daughter, Melissa. Oh, yes. Hello, how are you? Good to see you. Wow, you've really grown up. You know what? If you don't mind me saying so, she is turning into a stone cold fox. Better keep the frat boys away from her. I'm in eighth grade. STANLEY: She's in middle school. Yeah, middle school's amazing. It is extraordinary. An extraordinary time. It's not that children make me uncomfortable. It's just that, why be a dad when you can be a fun uncle? I've never heard of anyone rebelling against their fun uncle. They want how many spiral pads? Well, 50 I over-ordered because they had a back-order. MICHAEL: Okay. MEREDITH: I got permission to bring Jakey in to work. Which is great because he got suspended this week and now I don't have to pay for a sitter. Will you pull that down there? Okay, tell them what you wanted to say. Do you need any help? No. Thanks. We'd have to explain everything. It's probably just easier if we do it ourselves. All right, I wasn't expecting that. Let's go draw. Oh, my God. She is so cute I wanna die. Don't you just love kids, Angela? I guess I wouldn't mind a pair of small, well-behaved boys. God, I cannot wait to get pregnant and have babies. Kelly and I both agreed that we would just have fun. And I'm learning that fun for Kelly is getting married and having babies, immediately, with me. Just compare last year's order to this year's. Yeah, I'm looking at it right now. Yes. We Yeah, they're very They're different. Yeah, we can stick with last year's, we're just gonna have to supplement it, somehow. Hey, Abby, do you wanna help me shred some old documents? It's actually pretty cool. No thanks. I only have one goal today. To make one kid like me. Just one. What are you reading? From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler. Best book. Yeah, but I've read it before. So have I. Hey, question: If you had to spend the night in the Met or the aquarium, which would it be? Definitely the aquarium. Definitely. Yes. Glad you said that. You don't wanna help me with some of my sales, do you? 'Cause I'm kind of swamped. Sure. Really? Yes. And you're Abby, right? Yeah. I'm Jim. JIM: And, let's sell some paper. ABBY: All right. Let's start with your mom. Yes. Well, we can Hey, you know what? Can I call you back? I'll call you right back. Yes, I promise. Hello. Can I help you? You can pick that up if you want. That's all right. You wanna bring it over Here, I'll make some room. My name's Michael. What's your name? Sasha. Nice to meet you. Oh, you know what that is? That is a train whistle. Like I'm the conductor. But I'm sort of the conductor of the office here. Right? (WHISTLE TOOTING) You wanna try? Sure. All aboard for sales! Next stop, Kukabonga. (GIGGLES) (GROANING) You broke my hand! There is no way that hurt. Really? 'Cause she's pretty strong, Dwight. Little girl, come over here. Shake my hand. Come on. I don't have all day. I don't feel anything. Nothing. You're so weak. Excuse me. These are expensive collectors' items, okay? Do you have any computer games? No, I don't have computer games on my work computer. That would be inappropriate. Yeah, Meredith doesn't have any either. It's so lame here. You call your mom, Meredith? That's very disrespectful. Whatever, okay? You can refer to me as Mr. Schrute. That's your name? Mr. Poop? Schrute. Mr. Schrute. Sure, Mr. Poop. Schrute. Are you Mother Goose? I drink like a hundred iced macchiatos a day and practically nothing else. Wow. There's a really cool coffee place, Jitterz, at the Steamtown Mall. You ever been there? No. You've never been to Jitterz? Ryan, you are so dorky. Give me your number so I can text you. MELISSA: Come on. Do you have an e-mail address? I may be wrong, but I just thought you should know. I think something a little fishy is going on. STANLEY: A little fishy? KELLY: Yeah. I mean, I've been noticing them all day, and I just think That little girl is a child! I don't wanna see you sniffing around her anymore this afternoon. Do you understand? Yes, sir. Boy, have you lost your mind? No. 'Cause I'll help you find it. What you looking for? Ain't nobody gonna help you out there. Jesus can come through that door and he's not gonna help you if you don't stop sniffing after my child. Okay. Stanley yelled at me today. That was one of the most frightening experiences of my life. That was Greensleeves, a traditional English ballad about the beheaded Anne Boleyn. And now, a very special treat. A book my grom-mutter used to read me when I was a kid. This is a very special story. It's called Struwwelpeterl by Heinrich Hoffmann from 1864. "The great tall tailor always comes "to little girls that suck their thumbs." Are you listening, Sasha? Right? "And ere they dream what he's about, "he takes his great sharp scissors out "and then cuts their thumbs clean off." Dwight, Dwight There's a photo. What the hell are you reading to them? These are cautionary tales for kids. My grom-mutter used to read them Yeah, you know what? No, no, no, no. They No. The kids don't wanna hear some weirdo book that your Nazi war criminal grandmother gave you. What's a Nazi? What's a Nazi? Nazi was a fascist movement Don't From the 1930s in Germany Don't, don't talk about Nazis in front of You know what? They're gonna have nightmares. MICHAEL: Why don't you just shut it? I was gonna teach the children how to make cornhusk dolls. Why don't you just leave, okay? Okay. Bye, Mr. Poop. All right. There goes Mr. Poop. Now, who likes Dane Cook? I do! I do! Children cannot lie. They are innocent and they speak the truth. And out of the mouths of babes, Michael Scott is freaking cool. You know, I never misbehaved in front of my father because he was a very strict disciplinarian. I can only hope my mate has some of those same qualities. This is where the magic happens. Right over here. Let me show you this. See all these? You know what that is? That's paper. This is where paper comes from. Any questions? So, you cut the paper and dye it and stuff? No, we don't actually cut the paper. That's a good question. The paper is sent to us, cut and dyed, from a paper manufacturer. And then we sell it to a business for more than we paid for it. That's not fair. No. Yes, it is. Well No. You need someone in the middle to facilitate You're just a middleman. I'm not just a middleman. Wait. Why doesn't the sawmill just sell the paper directly to people? You are describing Office Depot. And they're kind of running us out of business. We have better service than they do. There's Creed! Let's take a look at what he's doing, everybody. This is Creed. And he is in charge of something. Right? That is correct. Say hi to the kids. Hi, kids. Have you ever seen a foot with four toes? MICHAEL: What are you doing? Stop it! Stop it! Just No, no, no, no, no! Would you cut it out? What is your problem? The hair covers it up mostly. No, no, no, we're not gonna see the four-toed Creed, okay? You know, there's something interesting about me that you might want to know. I used to be the star of a kids' show. CHILDREN: No way! MICHAEL: It's true. I did. MELISSA: You serious? I am totally serious. There was a show called Fundle Bundle and I was the star. ABBY: That doesn't sound like a show. It's true. I can prove it. I can prove it. Watch this. Ryan! Can you come here a second? (MICHAEL CLEARING THROAT) I would like you to go to my mother's house in Dickson City. And if she is at the pool, the back kitchen window should be unlocked. I want you to boost yourself up. All right. I want you to go down to the basement. In the basement is a tape labeled "Fundle Bundle." I want you to grab it. I want you to get my guitar. Right. Okay. I want you to get a tambourine. Do you know how to play the tambourine? I'm already getting the pizzas from Brunetti's, so You know, I can go with him. No! I will go. Okay. Thank you, Ryan. Good attitude. Hottest in the office. All right. Now, what kind of pizza do you like? MICHAEL: I don't get why parents are always complaining about how tough it is to raise kids. You joke around with them, you give them pizza, you give them candy, you let them live their lives. They're adults, for God's sake. I am going to give you a little blast from the past of Michael Gary Scott, when he was a child star and a show that you might remember called Fundle Bundle. MICHAEL: Okay, without further ado, Ryan. WOMAN ON TV: Fundle, are you ready CHILDREN: Yeah! Let's have some fun! That is Miss Trudy. You can't tell from the costume, but she had an amazing body. MICHAEL: Okay, you can fast-forward. And I want you JIM: Is that a real, functioning windmill? Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop. Yes! That is Edward R. Meow. That's pretty funny. Yes. Recess! Hey, what's your name? My name's Chet. Well, hi, Chet. Is that Chet Montgomery? MICHAEL: I don't know. That is! He's the meteorologist from channel 5. "Checking in with Chet. Doppler 7." ROY: That guy's legit. What do you wanna be when you grow up? I wanna be on TV. And he is on TV now! Would everybody please shut up? Please. So you don't miss it. Okay, next. So, what's your name? Oh, that's me! That's me! (ROY LAUGHING) What's your favorite subject in school? Recess. Recess. So, tell me, what do you wanna be when you grow up? I wanna be married and have a 100 kids so I can have 100 friends, and no one can say no to being my friend. Okay. Well, nice talking with you, Michael. Back to you, Miss Trudy. Hi, everyone. It's one of my favorite I could have sworn there was Did you get married? No. Why not? It just never happened. So, do you have any kids? Nope. JAKE: Do you have a girlfriend? I do okay. MELISSA: Was Chet Montgomery cool back then? Yes. JAKE: Even I have a girlfriend. Okay. All right. Okay. So, you didn't get to be what you wanted to be? I guess not. You know, I have a load of work to do. So, I am going to grab a slice of this delish pizza and I'm gonna go do my work. Bye. He's not coming out. He won't pick up the phone. I can't believe his mom dressed him like that. That's the real tragedy. Pam, Pam! I love this guy! Come on! So, Melissa, I met your mom a couple times. She's so nice. Who, Teri? That woman is not my mother. That is my stepmother. Mr. Poop, I have to tell you something. Okay. But first, that's not my name. You're ugly. Well, at least I'm not a horrible little latchkey kid who got suspended from school. So Meredith! (MOCKING) Yeah? I think these belong to you. Oh, that's okay. She can keep those. Believe me, she has enough toys. She doesn't need your watch. Thank you. Is everything okay? You have to ask me that because you work for Human Resources. That's true. You know, sure, playing the field is great. Don't get me wrong. But there's more to life than notches on my bedpost. Tell me something honestly. Do you think that it is too late for me to have kids? Well, you need a wife first. Or at least a girlfriend. What about Not Jan. Okay. If you really wanna have kids, I guess you could somehow A foster parent or something. Or biologically. Somehow. Thanks. That's No, that really means a lot to me. Hey, does Sasha have a godfather? Because Yes. Okay. Is it okay if I take one? Sure. Thank you. You're welcome. Is your job hard? It's not too bad. I get to shred things sometimes. Do you wanna see? Yeah! Really? Yeah. Okay. Here it is. Don't put your fingers in there. (SHREDDER HUMMING) (PAPER CRACKLING) Cool, huh? That's so cool, yeah! Yeah, I get to do this, like, every week. That's so awesome. I know. Yes, it is true. I, Michael Scott, am signing up with an online dating service. Thousands of people have done it. And I am going to do it. I need a username. And I have a great one. Little Kid Lover. That way people will know exactly where my priorities are at. Go ahead. Do you wanna come over for dinner tonight? Oh, man, I would love to. I can't tonight. But can I come over some other time? What are you doing? You never have plans. Thanks, Kev. I'm actually going on a date. Nice. MICHAEL: Hey, no please. You can't leave yet. There's still one more thing we need to do. (SINGING) You who are on the road Must have a code that you can live by BOTH: And so become yourself Because the past is just a good bye And teach your children well Why does he own a guitar if he doesn't know how to play. I think he thought his ukulele skills would transfer. And feed them on your dreams My theory is that The one they picks the one you'll know by Don't you ever ask them why If I told you, you would cry You just look at them and sigh and know they love you And they do. Your parents love you very much. One more time. You The Schrutes consider children very valuable. In the olden days, the women would bear many children, so we would have enough laborers to work the fields. And if it was an especially cold winter and there weren't enough grains or vegetables, they would eat the weakest of the brood. No, they didn't eat the children. It never came to that. So, Phil recruited me to sell these cards, and now I am recruiting you. Who is this guy again? Don't worry about Phil. He drives a Corvette. He's doing just fine. Okay. Calling cards are the wave of the future. These things sell themselves. Who uses calling cards anymore? You know what? That's a nice attitude, Ryan. I'm just helping you invest in your future, my friend. It sounds like a get-rich-quick scheme. Yes, thank you. You will get rich quick. We all will. Didn't you lose a lot of money on that other investment, that one from the e-mail? You know what, Toby? When the son of the deposed King of Nigeria e-mails you directly asking for help, you help. His father ran the freaking country, okay? All right, so raise your hand if you wanna get rich. All right. No. How is this not a pyramid scheme? All right, let me explain, again. (MICHAEL GRUNTING) MICHAEL: Phil has recruited me and another guy. Now we are getting three people each. The more people that get involved, the more people who are investing, the more money we're all gonna make. It's not a pyramid scheme. It is a It's not even a scheme, per se. It's I have to go make a call. Happy birthday, Michael. What? I said, "Happy birthday." Thank you. That's really nice. Today is my B-day. And people around here just go crazy for it. I don't know why. Oh, fun fact. I share my birthday with Eva Longoria. So, I have a perfect icebreaker if I ever meet Teri Hatcher. You excited? Everybody freaking out? Cool. It's gonna be fun. You're late. Thank you, it's noon. But, I forgive you. Because doth, it is my birthday. What's up? JIM: Hi. Oh, happy birthday. Thank you, sir. JIM: Michael's birthday. It's pretty fun to watch, actually. He gets very excited and then he eats a lot of cake. And then he runs around the office. And then he has a sugar crash in the afternoon. And then he falls asleep. And that's when we get our work done. Did you hear anything yet? No. I'm still waiting. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Yeah. Yes. There he is, the birthday boy. Oh, God. Birthday hug. No, no, no, no. New suit. Please. That suit is amazing. Thank you very much. It is from Italy. Actually, Bulgaria. So Maybe I should get one. Good luck. One-of-a-kind. EBay. Question: May I be in charge of the party planning festivities? Not necessary. The Party Planning Committee is all over it. They've been working 24l7, all day, yesterday. Excellent. On my part, I did manage to reserve the Don't! No. Please. Don't want to spoil it for anybody. Don't spoil the surprise. Let's get the party started. Let's get the party started. Not the way I taught you. (HUMMING) When should we bring out the cake, I'm sorry, are we boring you? I Party Planning Committee, listen up. Michael would like trick candles for his birthday cake, so make that a priority. Where do we get those? Not my problem. Here's a list of things that Michael would like to be surprised by. Michael wants a stripper gram? Yes, but he doesn't want to know when or whom. No. This is a closed-door meeting. (TELEPHONE RINGING) Yeah. PAM: Michael, I have Jan on the line. Oh, great, put her through. Okay. JAN: Hello, Michael? Hey, you. I'm returning your call. You said it was urgent. It is urgent. I just wanted to call and wish you a happy birthday. Well, today's not my birthday. So Really? 'Cause I thought we had the same birthday. Happy birthday, Michael. Thanks. Am I on camera? Nope. Totally private. You can say whatever is in your heart. (HANGING UP) You can take a five if you want. Somebody brought in donuts for my birthday. Happy birthday. Thanks. Man, I'm so sorry. When do you find out? They said this afternoon. They're waiting on a second opinion. Oh, okay. Second opinion on what? I might have skin cancer. Oh, no. I was watching Grey's Anatomy and there was a lifeguard on it, and he had skin cancer, too. Kelly, you know what I never really thought about death until Princess Diana died. That was the saddest funeral ever. That and my sister's. Who brought in donuts? Somebody got donuts for my birthday. Happy birthday. You didn't know it was my birthday? I guess I forgot. Well, I guess I forgot to give you a donut. Are you serious? Skin cancer is treatable. Right. It's gonna be okay. You don't know it's going to be okay. Don't give him false hope. It's probably nothing though. Hi. Delivery for Michael Scott. MICHAEL: Here we go. Okay, this is great. Thank you, my friends. She is perfect. Dwight, may I have your chair, please? And some singles if you will? All right. Okay. All right. This has arms. Is that gonna be a Is that all right? Sure. (LAUGHING) Okay. I'm so nervous. I can sign for it. Oh, thanks. When I was seven, my mother hired a pony and a cart to come to my house for all the kids. And I got a really bad rash from the pony. And all the kids got to ride the pony and I had to go inside. And my mother was rubbing cream on me for probably three hours and I never came outside. And by the time I got out, the pony was already in the truck and around the corner. So that was my worst birthday. Stop it! Stop! What is that? It's For The Longest Time by William Joel. Yeah. It's your favorite song. Yeah, when it's on the radio. My birthday blows. Nobody even signed my birthday poster. Apparently, my mother is the only one who cares enough to send me anything. I probably care more than she does. You're making it worse. I bet Luke Perry's friends don't treat him like this. When does he hear? Sometime today. Poor Kevin. If I knew I had a week to live, I would probably go to Europe. And South America. And the Grand Canyon. And I would want to see the Pacific Ocean. It would be a pretty busy week. That's a list price of $4.50. (WATCH ALARM BEEPING) Unfortunately, this item is on back-order. Michael! Michael! Michael! Michael! Michael! Come here, come here, come here, come here. What? What? Listen up, everyone. It is 11:23 exactly. The exact moment when you emerged from your mother's vaginal canal. So, huh? Right, have a seat please. Oh, God. There is a tradition that the Hebrews have of hoisting the birthday boy up on a chair. Oh, no. So come over and help me celebrate Michael's birth moment. Kevin! Oh, no, no, no! I'll do it. Ryan, come on. DWIGHT: Creed. Let's do this. DWIGHT: Come on, Stanley, let's go! I feel like we should go get Kevin something. Do you think we can sneak out of here? Maybe, but we're gonna need somebody to create a diversion and DWIGHT: On three, we're gonna hoist away. Ready? Okay. Happy birth moment, Michael. Thank you. One! Two! Three! Whoa, Whoa! Cut All right, all right, watch it please. DWIGHT: Oscar. It wasn't me. Okay, that is not an 8-foot sub. We don't make an 8-foot sub. This is eight 1-foot subs. F. All right, what's the damage? $39.60. $39. Sixty. Why tip someone for a job I'm capable of doing myself? I can deliver food, I can drive a taxi, I can and do cut my own hair. I did, however, tip my urologist. Because I am unable to pulverize my own kidney stones. Here they come. Get in here. Come and get it. Everybody, birthday party subs. My gift to you. OSCAR: What is this? Baloney, tomato and ketchup. The best. These are all the same. Yes. Baloney? I don't eat baloney. Well, then just have the tomato and ketchup. It's still good. No. Just the bread. It's fresh-baked. No. Okay. Get whatever you want. And choke on it. When I was 16, I was supposed to go out on a date with a girl named Julie. But there was another Michael in the class that she apparently thought the date was with. So she went out with him on my birthday. And she got him a cake at the restaurant, and it wasn't even his birthday. But I heard about it the next day in school. So, that was the worst birthday I think I ever had. So, we got Kev some stuff. Party pack of M&amp;M;'s, his favorite candy. A DVD of American Pie 2, which is his favorite movie. And he lent it to Creed, so I can guarantee you he won't get that back. Sixty-nine Cup of Noodles. Which we realize sounds crass, but it is his favorite number. And his favorite lunch. Hey, Temp, you know we still got five feet of sandwich left. Someone ate three feet of that thing? Hell, yeah. Save room for ice cream cake. Thank you. Oh, I got it. Wait. It's the Party Planning Committee. (WHISPERING) This is the most important day of the year. I can't risk anything. Fine. What about that meeting later to discuss finances? Yes. (WHISPERING) But don't expect any cookie. But what if I'm hungry? No cookie. What? You use fabric softener? Yeah. You don't? No, I do. Okay. ALL: Happy birthday dear Michael (CELL PHONE RINGING) Happy birthday to you Hello. Hey. Kevin, respect the birthday, please? No. No, not yet. I will. Goodbye. It was just Daisy. MICHAEL: Are you done? Good. Okay. I'm gonna Here we go. Make a wish. blow out the candles. Okay. (DWIGHT CHEERING EXCITEDLY) Yeah! I asked for trick candles. Pam was supposed to get them. Sorry. Okay. Well, when she comes back we'll do it again. Hello? What about the birthday boy? Haven't had a hug all day. No one cares about your birthday. Kevin's waiting to hear if he has skin cancer. Oh, that sucks! Great. Wow, that's good timing. That's Sorry, that's terrible. Terrible news. That's terrible news for both of us. We should probably head back. Yeah, okay. Oh, I dare you to make an announcement. You dare me? How old are you? Just quit stalling. Luke, this is your father. Come set the table for dinner. Such a dork. Jim Halpert, price check on fabric softener. The kind with the cute Ma'am, please don't touch that. That is not a toy. Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry. How old are you? I hate you. Honestly, is there any way you can get on your fiancee's plan? Our health plan is terrible. Here you are. Good news. Did some research. It turns out that fully recover. It's still scary. Yeah, but it's not brain cancer, and it shouldn't stop us from having fun. You know what they say the best medicine is? Well the doctor said a combination of interferon and Dacarbazine. And laughter also. I don't really think people are in the laughing mood. Why are you here? I didn't even invite you to my birthday party. I work here. "I work here." All right. Well, you know what? Since Toby doesn't speak for everybody, and I am your boss, I think you should just go home. Take the rest of the afternoon off. Take a sick day. If I go home now, I'll just drive myself crazy. Well, you're pretty much driving everybody else here crazy. Crazy with worry. Where have you been? And don't say the bathroom, because I kicked in all the stalls. Well, that's an invasion of privacy, so I'm gonna tell Michael. Please, don't. You owe me. Excuse me, everyone. Attention, please. Kevin, we're gonna take you to a very special place, a place that will make you happy, and a place that is far, far away from the evil sun. Is this trip in any way related to your birthday? How dare you, sir. You are gross. That should not be there. I'll get someone to take it down. No, it's all right. It's already up. Just leave it. Where's Kevin? Come on, let's get our skate on! Don't be scared. You're good. You're good. JIM: I wanna go Think you can let go? No. (JIM EXCLAIMING) Okay. Yeah! Who's that? Was that Michael? Yeah, I've been pretty much skating my whole life. I thought about playing in the NHL, but you're on the road so much. You get no time to spend with your wife and kids. And I really want a wife and kids. (GROWLING) (LAUGHING) I got it. Hey, Pam. All the stuff with Kevin is pretty scary. And I'm thinking that next time you're in the shower, you should check yourself out. You know, give yourself an exam. Those things are like ticking time-bags. All right? Think about it. It's something to think about. I just can't relax about it, you know? MICHAEL: Kevin! You heard anything yet? No, not yet. Okay. Well, live strong. Okay, Michael. All right. CAROL: Michael? Yeah. Carol? Yeah. She sold me my condo. Hey, what, is this place on the market or No, I don't just sell real estate. My daughter has a skating lesson. Oh, these all your kids? No, just the front two. Oh. Hey, guys. What's up? You wanna go for a ride? Is that okay? Sure. Cool. All right, grab on. Here we go. You ready? Hang on tight. All right. We are moving. We are really moving now! (ELECTRONIC BEEPING) (CELL PHONE RINGING) MICHAEL: Push. Good, that's great. You got it. Excuse me. Hello? Yeah, okay. All right. Okay, I will. Thanks. It's negative. Oh, God! We're gonna beat this, okay? We're gonna Come here. Well, apparently, in the medicine community, "negative" means "good," which makes absolutely no sense. In the real world community that would be chaos. This is awesome. Thanks, you guys. Okay, who is this from? Wowee, look at that jersey! Turn it around. Turn it around. Cool. Show it. Great. "From Dwight. Number One." Thank you, Dwight. That's great. Thanks. Michael. Yeah. This is from all of us. Oh, you didn't need to do that. Night Swept. This is really amazing. Thank you. I love it. Michael's birthday was actually pretty cool. It was a good day. I don't know. It was a good day. DWIGHT: Kevin Malone, you're next. Spit that out. Spit. Okay, come on. Let's go. You look cute today, Dwight. Thanks, girl. So, yesterday Dwight found half a joint in the parking lot, which is unfortunate, because, as it turns out, Dwight finding drugs is more dangerous than most people using drugs. Let's go over some of these symptoms of marijuana use, shall we? You tell me who this sounds like. Slow moving, inattentive, dull, constantly snacking, shows a lack of motivation. Hey. I like the people I work with, generally, with four exceptions. But someone committed a crime, and I did not become a Lackawanna County volunteer sheriff's deputy to make friends. And by the way, I haven't. (IMITATING STANLEY) I enjoy the tangy zip of Miracle Whip. (PAM LAUGHING) Jim does the best impressions. Sometimes he'll look up at me from his desk, and he'll just be someone else. Like, he'll go That's supposed to be Phyllis. I can't do it as good as he can. And the guys are saying, "Chug! Chug! Chug!" But I'm so small and all I had eaten that day was one of those Auntie Em pretzels from the food court. So I said, "Is it okay if I sip it?" And they said, "No." But Ryan seemed cool either way Stop! This is not "Kelly Kapour's Story Hour." Illegal drugs were consumed on company property, okay? Your ass is on the line, mister! My ass is on the line! Now, I'm gonna ask you again, what time did you go home last night? I didn't know that you were at a party on Saturday night. I go to a lot of parties. Okay, I'm gonna need to search your car. Give me your keys. I am not giving you my keys. Don't make me do this the hard way. What's the hard way? I go down to the police station on my lunch break. I tell a police officer, I know several, what I suspect you may have in your car. He requests a hearing from a judge and obtains a search warrant. Once he has said warrant, he will drive over here and make you give him the keys to your car and you will have to obey him. Yeah, let's do it that way. Dwight! Is he bugging you? Dwight, dude, you gotta take a chill pill, man. It was one joint in the parking lot. You know, you're totally harshing the office mellow. I can't stop this investigation. It is my job. Whoa, you are a volunteer. I volunteered for this job. And that's not the same. It is my duty Volunteer duty. to investigate the crime scene. I have six more interviews to go, and then I will reveal what I know. (COUGHING) Narc! (SNICKERING) If you are attempting to compliment me, then you have done a very good job. I wasn't attempting to compliment you. Well, you have, because being a narc is one of the hardest jobs that you can have. Okay. And I am very proud of being Why don't you just cool it? Cool it! So Dwight, please! God! (IMITATING STONER) Dude, where's my office? I totally lost it because I was half-baked, smoking doobies! Doobie Brothers. I was smoking doobies with my brothers. Peace out, Seacrest! Well, your office is behind you. Thanks. Munchies. Who wants some munchies? I don't think Michael's ever done drugs. I don't know if anyone's ever offered him any. DWIGHT: Oscar visited Mexico, when he was five, to attend his great-grandmother's funeral. What does that mean to a United States law enforcement officer? He's a potential drug mule. Have you ever taken any illegal drugs? No, I have not. Do you think it's possible that maybe you could have had some drugs in your system without you knowing about it? What are you implying? Have you ever pooped a balloon? Okay, I'm done with this. He sure left in a hurry. I don't wanna blow this. DWIGHT: This is what all good law enforcement officers dream of, the chance to solve an actual crime. DWIGHT: Do you know what this is? Yes, it's marijuana. How do you know that? It's labeled. Damn it. That is Northern Lights, Cannabis indica. (SIGHING) No. It's marijuana. I'm just saying that you can't be sure that it wasn't you. That's ridiculous. Of course it wasn't me. Marijuana is a memory loss drug, so maybe you just don't remember. I would remember. Well, how could you if it just erased your memory? That's not how it works. Now, how do you know how it works? Knock it off, okay? I'm interviewing you. No! You said I'd be conducting the interview when I walked in here. Now, exactly how much pot did you smoke? So, Pam told me you do a great Stanley impression. I'd love to hear it. (HESITATING) OSCAR: Good. "Why do you keep cc-ing me on things that have nothing to do with me?" Is that supposed to be me? Oh, hey, Stanley. I was just doing an impression. I do not think that is funny. He does everyone in the office. Hmm. "I do not think that is funny." "I do not think that is funny." Jinx. Buy me a Coke. No, no! No talking! Jim is not allowed to talk until after he buys me a Coke. Those are the rules of Jinx and they are unflinchingly rigid. "Sold out"? That has never happened in the history of Jinx. Sorry, it's not my problem. DWIGHT: I know you're innocent, but it can't look like I'm treating you any differently. I understand. (SHOUTING) Where were you yesterday after work? MICHAEL: Uh-oh, uh-oh. Who's he calling? Ratting somebody out! Narc! Narc! Kevin. That is so good, Michael. MICHAEL: Remember the narc bit? Okay, I will let them know. Uh-oh. Who's in trouble? Attention, everyone! Drug testers are coming in a couple of hours to test everyone's urine. (LAUGHING) What? What are you talking about? Company policy. If drugs are found on the premises, there is automatic drug testing conducted within 24 hours. Is that true, Toby? When you sign your job application, you agree to comply with random drug testing. MICHAEL: Two nights ago, I went to an Alicia Keys concert at the Montage Mountain Performing Arts Center. I had scored these great aisle seats. Anyway, after the opening act, this beautiful girl sits down next to me. And I never get to meet girls with lip rings and she had one. I don't know exactly how this happened, but one of her friends started passing around some stuff and they said that it was clove cigarettes. And I'm sure that it was clove cigarettes. Everybody in the aisle was doing it. Okay, attention, everyone! The drug testing has been cancelled. Instead, I will be going around to each of you and doing a visual inspection. No, you can't do that. I can do that. It is my office! DWIGHT: No, you cannot. It has to be official and it has to be urine. All right. Okay. Kevin, what prescription drugs are you taking besides Rogaine? I'm not taking Rogaine. Angela, what about you? I don't take any prescription drugs. You're not on anything? Good. KELLY: So, the first time we went out to dinner, it was like, whatever, fine. But I was so nervous. So this time, I wanted it to be special. So I bought a new dress! One of those kinds that's kind of low-cut at the top to show something. But not everything. I mean, not everything, Jim. I promise Hey, guys. What's going on? We're just having the best conversation. Okay, well, Michael wants to see everyone in the conference room. But you know what? We have a few minutes, so you guys should definitely finish up your conversation. KELLY: Thanks. So, I was looking so hot It has come to my attention that some people here think that the use of drugs is something to laugh about. We don't feel that way. No, not at all. You were the one joking around, calling Dwight a narc. No, no. That was a test. I was testing you. And you all failed. Miserably. When I said that Dwight was a narc, how many of you defended him? How many of you said, "Hey, you know what? He's right. "What he's doing is protecting this office from the evils of drugs." Thank you, Michael. I am ridiculously anti-drug. I am so anti-drug that I am above suspicion in any way that involves suspicion or testing of any kind. Drugs ruin lives, people. Drugs destroy careers. Take Cheech and Chong. Everybody knows that Cheech and Chong are funny. But just imagine how funny they would be if they didn't smoke pot. I want everybody to take a look to their left. Now, I want everybody to take a look to their right. One of those people will be dead from drug use at some point in their lives. This year more people will use cocaine than will read a book to their children. Where did you get these facts? Are these facts scaring you or are they not? They are not. Do you think that smoking drugs is cool? Do you think that doing alcohol is cool? STANLEY: No, I don't. And I have a glass of red wine with dinner about once a week, for the antioxidants. TOBY: Yeah, I have the same MICHAEL: Okay. Enough, enough, enough! I have written down a list of illegal drugs. Take a gander. How many of these are you familiar with? Hookah is not an illegal drug, Michael. Yes, it is. No, it's not. It's a type of pipe. You can fill it with tobacco, often mixed with fruit or other flavors Okay, you know what, Toby? Pam, could you take this down? In addition to Toby's urine being tested, I would like to test his blood and his hair. You can't do that. I can test anyone randomly, and I have chosen you randomly. That's not random. Okay. Eenie, meenie, minie, moe, is random. Okay, you know what? I'm gonna need a volunteer to select one of these words and tell us of something tragic that happened in either their lives or the lives of a loved one. Yeah, Pam. I know that Jim has an amazing story about a relative of his who got caught up in the world of drugs. MICHAEL: Really? PAM: Mmm-hmm. Jim, it's okay. You can This would be a good place to let it out, Jim. These are people you can trust. These are people who care about you. It's okay. Just We will not judge you. We are here to not judge you. Oh, he's doing it. Okay. It's okay. Okay, are you sure? That looked like it was gonna be good. All right. Okay, well Wow! He really pulled out the big guns. Fake crying. I did not expect that. The point I'm trying to make with all of this, people, is that I hate drugs. I hate them! And based upon what I have seen, you all don't quite hate them as much as I do. So, you are going to have a drug test and I am not. No, you will be tested. Yes, I will Will not be. No, you will be. That is the law according to the rules. Okay, well, Dwight, just know that I've been very busy today and I've got a lot of work to do and I wasn't planning on going to the bathroom and I don't even know if anything's gonna come out. Okay? So, good. Thank you. Hi, Linda. Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager. You might remember testing my urine a few years back when I was applying to be a volunteer sheriff's deputy. We test a lot of urine. Mine was green. Oh, right. How are you? I'm all better. So, I need you to do some work on the Saint Andrews account. I need your urine, I need some filing done. What kind of filing? Just forget it. Just the urine. That goes directly to the tester. Just I need your urine. Like in a cup? Yes, in a cup. We're not animals, Dwight. For what purpose? It's none of your business. Then I refuse. Okay, all right, just I went to an Alicia Keys concert over the weekend. And I think I may have gotten high accidentally by a girl with a lip ring. Are you serious? I need clean urine for the lady. (SIGHING) But that's illegal. Don't think of it that way. It's like urine goes all over the place. You know, there's no controlling it. It just Not my urine. A cup could find its way under the urine. It might be an accident. We have Were you forced to do drugs at this concert? No, just Is something wrong? Look, just Just fill up the cup. Do you want to give Michael your urine? I want him to have all the urine he needs. You're not gonna get my permission on this. I know that. Don't you think I know that? Yeah, we do testing all over the country. Cool. Hey, are you guys hiring? You want to work at the urinalysis lab? Yeah. Maybe. (DWIGHT MOANING) My father's name was Dwight Schrute. My grandfather's name was Dwight Schrute. His father's name? Dwide Schrude. Amish. I loved my father very much. Every morning he'd wake up at dawn and make us biscuits with gravy. When I was little, my dad and I played a lot of games together. My dad cheated a lot, but I never busted him on it. I would have, except I didn't know about it. He didn't tell me till years later. And I was shocked when I found out. What? Did you wanna tell me something? You look like you want to tell me something. You look like you have something really important to say and you just can't for some reason. Come on, you can tell me. Jim, you can tell me anything. I'd like a magazine. We just need urine, sir. I'd still like one. MICHAEL: Dwight, well, I passed the test, thanks to you and your untainted pee. Thank you very much. That's great. What's wrong? Where's your costume? It's a uniform. And I turned it in today when I tendered my resignation. Why? What I took an oath when I was sworn in. And I broke that oath today. Here. Just buy it from me. I haven't talked to you in hours and it's been weird. And I really wanna know what the hell's going on with Dwight. Hi. Hey. How much time do you have left on your break? Ten minutes. Since you did such a good job with the investigation, I decided to pull a few strings, call in a few favors, and I've decided to make you official security supervisor of the branch. Really? Yes, sir. That's fantastic. Because I've always felt that the security here sucked. So, you wanna "Dwight K. Schrute, I hereby declare you an honorary volunteer corporal "in charge of assisting all activities' security." Okay. Here's your badge. Thank you, Michael. Very nice, great. Can I have a gun? No. I don't have a gun. Okay. I'll have to bring in my bo staff. I don't think so. Don't Good. Thank you, Michael. No I need to go over some details with you. All right. First of all Well, thank you. Hank. Okay. How many orange traffic cones do you have? Two. Oh, God. Wow. What a terrible day to not be able to talk. JIM: Dwight was literally carrying around his own urine and dressed like one of The Village People. Why does he do the things that he does for Michael? I just don't get it. What is he getting out of that relationship?   So have you found a band yet for your wedding? No. 'Cause I'm in a band. We really rock. Yeah. I mean, it's inevitable. I definitely overhear some wedding preparation, but I'm fine with it. She hears me arranging my social life. And we both have to hear Dwight order deer urine over the Internet. So it evens out. Oh, I got the Save-the-Date. Yeah? Yeah. Pretty stationery. Oh, thanks. ANGELA: I didn't get mine yet. Oh. There are a few people I decided not to invite, and that might make things kind of awkward, but it's my wedding. And I don't want anyone there who has called me a hussy. Yes, thanks. Fantastic Sams, Adult Cut Plus. Comes with a shampoo and blow-dry. We're doing ID photos today. Gotta represent. On or off? Off. Okay. Oh, what is on your face? Is that a disguise? Excuse me. Clown paint. ID badges are long overdue. Security in this office park is a joke. Last year, I came to work with my spud gun in a duffel bag. I sat at my desk all day with a rifle that shoots potatoes at 60 pounds per square inch. Can you imagine if I was deranged? MICHAEL: That's a nice tie. Thank you. That is Who makes that? I don't know. Do you mind if I wear that for the photo? Let's Let's keep our clothes. OSCAR: It's like child abuse! I say, if Jesus saw that, he'd freak out! He'd freak out, Toby! I mean, on so many levels! And I'm supposed to work there? I'm supposed to What's the dealio? Just letting Oscar vent a little. We would use the break room, but the photographer's back there. What's the problem? Angela. There's just a little dispute over a poster in their workspace. Since Christmas. So, what, you're having a little spat? I forget, are you guys dating? No. Michael, can I talk to you for a second, please? Yes. Here's how I usually handle this. All I do is listen, you know? These things just have a way of working themselves out. It's like if you write someone a letter when you're really angry, they say to keep it in a drawer for a couple of days and then you just never end up sending it. What do you know about conflict resolution? Your answer to everything is to get divorced. So Okay. Okay, what? That was the right decision for me and my marriage. Yeah. Well, that's not gonna fly here, because in this office it is till death do us part. Assuming that we don't get downsized. Pam, would you get Angela and meet us in the conference room, please? A "Mediators Toolchest." Okay. Well, before we get started, you should know that there are five different styles of conflict. (IN MOCK ASIAN ACCENT) My Shaolin temple style defeats your monkey style. Can we go? I have a lot of work to do. No. This is important. Okay. The first style is lose-Iose. What's the next one? Just hold on, please. Okay. If we do lose-Iose, neither of you gets what you want. Do you understand? You would both lose. Now, I need to ask you, do you want to pursue a lose-Iose negotiation? Can we just skip to whatever number five is, win-win or whatever. Win-win is number four. And number five is win-win-win. The important difference here is with win-win-win, we all win. Me, too. I win for having successfully mediated a conflict at work. Okay. So this is the disputed poster. Now, one at a time, I want you to express your feelings, using "l" emotion language, and no judging or "you" statements. I got this poster for Christmas and I feel I want to see it every day. It makes me feel like the babies are the true artists, and God has a really cute sense of humor. Come on. Seriously, that? I don't like looking at it. It's creepy and in bad taste, and it's just offensive to me. It makes me think of the horrible, frigid stage mothers who forced the babies into it. It's kitsch. It's the opposite of art. It destroys art, it destroys souls. This is so much more offensive to me than hard-core porn. Okay, okay, okay. Stop. Stop. Stop. Let's see if we can't just brainstorm and find some creative alternatives that are win-win. Win. Yes. Thank you, Pam. How about Angela makes the poster into a t-shirt, which Oscar wears. That way he can never see it and whenever she looks at Oscar, she can see it. Win-win-win. No. That's No. Okay. Well, brainstorm. Own the solution. How about I leave it up? How about she takes it down? How about Angela can keep it up on Tuesdays and Thursdays? Okay. That is called a compromise. And it is style three, and it is not ideal. To sum up, win-win: Make the poster into a t-shirt. Win-Iose: Take the poster down. Compromise: Tuesdays and Thursdays. And the answer is make the poster into a t-shirt. Win-win. Win. Fine. But It is done. No, you're all good. Great. PAM: Hey, Angela. I didn't have your zip code. Oh. Thanks. It was hand-delivered. But I did get a Save-the-Date after all. It's not my taste. You solved it? Yes. Well, good. We can throw that one out. Are those all the other complaints? Mmm-hmm. I would like to see those, please. I can't do that. You can't do that, huh? Okay. Now you and I have a conflict. I order you to give me that file. That Okay. There. No more conflict. I had to use win-Iose on that. It was not pretty. All right. Is that it? It's all Dwight's. Every Friday at 4:00 I have a standing appointment with Dwight for him to file a grievance against Jim. I tell him that I'm sending them to a special file in New York. That box is the special file in New York. Oh, God. All right. Why do I have to do everything? PHOTOGRAPHER: Are you sure? Oh, he's sure. Just shoot. This is from Kevin. He says Stanley uses his Miracle Whip without asking. Meredith complains that everyone talks too loud in the morning and the lights are too bright. Creed (MUTTERING) Creed is sick of looking at the redhead all day, and wants a seat facing the receptionist. Nice. You will notice that not one of these complaints is against me. Actually, I have a separate folder for complaints against Michael. This is January through March of this year. How many of you have, at one time, gone to Toby to complain about another employee? And did you get what you wanted? Or were you merely listened to, you forget about your problem and you move on? ALL: (MUMBLING) Merely listened to and forgotten. That is outrageous. I love this place, and it pains me to see all of the negativity festering. Okay. Today we are going to get everything out of these files and into the open where it can be resolved. All right. How about the Phyllis-Angela dispute. You already did me. MICHAEL: That's what she said. The thing is, Angela, you are in here an awful lot. You have complained about everybody in the office, except Dwight, which is odd because everyone else has had run-ins with Dwight. Toby, by the way, what does "redacted" mean? There is a file full of complaints in here marked "redacted"? Yeah. It just means whoever complained came to me later and withdrew it. So, I just took their name off. Okay. There were a bunch of complaints about Dwight that were put in the redacted file about six months ago. Wait. If someone has a problem with me, why would they withdraw it six months ago? Let's move on. I volunteer. Did anyone have a problem with me? All right. Pamela! Come on down! Let's do it. And Okay. Just one complaint. Actually, it has been withdrawn. So that is no help to us. Next! Wait. What did it say? "Does she have to plan her wedding on office time?" "Shouldn't she do that at home?" MICHAEL: Who else? Why don't we just warm up first? Warm up emotionally. All right? PAM: I have this kind of big secret about Angela. And I've been really nice to her, and I haven't told anyone, and What the hell! Here is a Kelly complaint. "Ryan never returns my calls." Join the club. My voicemail's real spotty sometimes. I didn't file a complaint. I was just talking. To your HR representative. To my friend, I thought. I want that withdrawn. Fine. I'll take your name off so no one will know. Making progress. Yes? Dwight tried to kiss me. DWIGHT: What? And I didn't tell anyone 'cause I'm not really sure how I feel about it. That is not true. Redact it. Redact it. Well, I'm not actually making a formal complaint. I just really think we should talk about it. Okay. Question. When a name is withdrawn, does that also apply to the permanent misbehavior file in New York? Sure. MICHAEL: Stanley, you got a lot of anger under there, buddy Hey, thanks for ratting me out. I didn't do it. I find that hard to believe, considering you have problems with every single person in this entire office except Bobblehead Joe. Someone complained that the men's room is whites only. Stanley, you know that's not true. I didn't say that. Then why is there a picture of a white man on the door. Okay. Phyllis, you complained that Angela is giving you dirty looks and you tried to get off the party-planning committee. I never said any such thing. Angela and I are close. And, also, Phyllis, Stanley says that you cry too much and that that bugs him. Stanley and I are close, too. We sit close. MICHAEL: Okay. Just take it. I can't believe Angela. And I went against my better judgment and I gave her a Save-the-Date. And now it turns out she complained about me to Toby. Well, it was redacted. Look, if she wants an invite, maybe she's just trying to be friends. Don't take her side. Well, what does Roy think about everything? I don't know. I try not to bother him about this kind of stuff. You mean, like your thoughts and feelings. Yeah. Yeah. I know you keep saying it's your space even though there's no assigned parking, but I keep forgetting. Yes, that's the problem. I guess so. Okay. Well, all settled then. I don't like you. Okay. Ryan, you told Toby that Creed has a distinct old man smell? I know exactly what he's talking about. I sprout mung beans on damp paper towel in my desk drawer. Very nutritious, but they smell like death. All right, Kevin. You are accused of making sexually suggestive remarks to Angela that made her feel uncomfortable. Solution: Angela, you are to make sexually suggestive remarks to Kevin that will make him uncomfortable. I accept your decision. Hey, you know what, Dwight? Maybe we should get our photo ID taken together. That doesn't make any sense. Well, it saves time, you know. 'Cause we could just meet in the parking lot every morning, walk in together. Perfect. PHOTOGRAPHER: Smile. No. I never smile, if I can help it. Showing one's teeth is a submission signal in primates. When someone smiles at me, all I see is a chimpanzee begging for its life. This came out really well. There you go. This is humongous. I am not a security threat. And my middle name is Kurt, not fart. What did I write? I have another complaint for Jim's permanent file. Talk to Michael. I gave him the box. What box? I didn't report your snoring Over here. God, God, God! No! No! Four years of malfeasance unreported. This cannot stand. Okay. Calm down. No, you calm down. Whose side is Toby on? Whose side are you on? Hey! Him or me? Him or me? I cannot work with Jim anymore. Either he goes or I go. Dwight. Stop. You choose! One of us is out of here by the end of today! Okay. I am not bluffing. Okay? Okay. Yes. Do the right thing here, Michael. Okay. I have served you loyally for years. I deserve this. You know I do. You know, your ID says you're a security threat. You have till 5:00. (CLEARING THROAT) DWIGHT: Oh, look, Jim. There's a sales manager position open in Stamford. Want me to call Jan and tell her you're interested? I could put in a good word for you 'cause I'll still be working here. Transfer. Transfer. Everybody! Transfer! Transfer! Transfer! Okay, you two. In the conference room with me. Nobody leaves until we work this out. Cage match. Cage matches? Yeah, they work. How could they not work? If they didn't work, everybody would still be in the cage. Okay. So, Dwight, in your own words, "Someone replaced all my pens and pencils with crayons. I suspect Jim Halpert. "Everyone has called me Dwayne all day. I think Jim Halpert paid them to." Yes. 5 bucks each and it was totally worth it. "This morning I found a bloody glove in my desk drawer, "and Jim Halpert tried to convince me I committed murder. "I think he may be the real murderer." "Jim Halpert said there was an abandoned infant in the women's room. "When I went to save the child, I saw Meredith on the can." Gag. "This morning, I knocked myself in the head with the phone." JIM: That actually took a while. I had to put more and more nickels into his handset, till he got used to the weight. And then I just took them all out. "Every time I typed my name, it said diapers." Just a simple macro. You know, these actually don't sound that funny, one after another. But he does deserve it, though. "By the end of the day, my desk was about two feet closer to the copier." Yeah. I just moved it an inch every time he went to the bathroom. And that's how I spent my entire day, that day. MICHAEL: The Japanese have this thing called shiatsu massage, where they dig into your body very hard. And it is very painful and, apparently, some people throw up. But the next day they feel great. I've never had one. They sound awful. Maybe Stamford would be cool. It's a good market. Higher volume. Yeah. Maybe we should both go. I have a girlfriend. Sure you do, Dwight. Sure. Hey. There's, like, Let's get to them later. So, are you going to transfer Jim or not? Maybe. I haven't decided yet. Let's get to work. I want an answer by tomorrow. Okay. Actually, tomorrow's not good. How about later in the week? Fine. Good. Okay. Hey! Wait. How about a group picture, while you're here? I can't. I only get reimbursed for the ID photos. Well, it's a computer camera, right? You mean digital? Yeah. It'll take like two seconds. (SIGHING) All right. Everybody, come on! Group photo for the newsletter! You've gotta be kidding. MICHAEL: Come on, everybody. Come on. Let's go. Creed, Kevin, Oscar, andale! Let's go. One, two, three, smile. Try to smile. We resolved a lot today, everybody. Think happy thoughts. All right, I'm just gonna take it on three, whether you smile or not. One, two, three. Good. Let's check that out. (MICHAEL EXCLAIMS IN DISGUST) Okay. All right. One more. Take one more. That'll be another $20. What? Angela, I want to talk to you about something. What? No, Pam. I am. It's about the Save-the-Date. Pam, it wasn't her. What? I'm the one who complained about you. I didn't know that Toby was going to write it down. MICHAEL: Good. I was just venting. Check that out. You know, it was just It was one day. MICHAEL: That's terrible. I took it right back. It was just like Okay. Oh, dear. Okay. We can do this. Come on, everybody. All right. Here we go. MICHAEL: It was really hard getting a good picture of 15 people. He would not give me a discount, and eight tries added up. One, two Didn't say "three," did I? But I'm sort of an expert at Photoshop, so it turned out fine in the end. When people work together, there is going to be conflict. You can't outrun your problems. Hey, Pam. It's Jim. I have a doctor's appointment in the city, so I probably won't be in till the late afternoon. Just thought I'd let you know. Okay, bye. Okay, Jan will see you now. Oh, thanks. MICHAEL: And that is why the idea of a cage match is so universally appealing. But here's the thing about cage matches, sometimes you have to open the cage. And that is something that Toby will never understand. MICHAEL: Tonight the Scranton Business Park is having Casino Night and we are converting our warehouse into a full-blown gambling hall. And I know it's illegal in Pennsylvania, but it's for charity. And I consider myself a great philanderer. It's just It's nice to know, at the end of the day, I can look in the mirror and say, "Michael, because of you, some little kid in the Congo "has a belly full of rice this evening." Makes you feel good. (DOOR CLOSES) Excuse me. How long is the wait for a table for two? I would never, ever serve you. Not in a million, billion years. It's a nice tux. I know. It belonged to my grandfather. He was buried in it, so family heirloom. So, what's the deal? We gotta pay for our own drinks? That's lame. Come on, it'll be fun, and besides, I'm a roulette expert. Impossible. Roulette is not a game of skill, it is a game of chance. I can always kind of win at roulette. Oh, really? Mmm-hmm. Yeah. How would you do that? Mind control. You can't be serious. Are you serious? Ever since I was a little kid, like, eight or nine, I could sort of control things with my mind. I don't believe you. Continue. It was just little things, you know, like I could make something shake or I could make a marble fall off the counter. You know, just little things. That's ridiculous. You know what? Uh Why don't you move that coat rack? Excuse me, everyone! Attention in the office, please. Jim is about to prove his telekinetic powers and he needs absolute silence. Go ahead. Okay, I'll try. Oh, my God. I try not to think of it as lagging behind. It's more of a David-and-Goliath thing. JAN: Yeah, but Well, the fact of the matter is that your branch is currently number four of the five branches that I oversee. Top 80%! Michael? Yeah? You know that I'm very serious here. Jan, listen, I promise that I will kick it up a notch. Bam! What? Emeril. Oh, actually, while I have you, not that I have you or have ever had you, but we're having our Casino Night tonight and I think everyone would love to see their fearless leader here. I thought that you were their fearless leader. I am, but you are the Eva Peron to my Cesar Chavez. (JAN LAUGHS) I think you can handle it. Oh, come on. Come on. I think so, Michael You know, it'd be fun. I can hear it in your voice. You need a break. Goodbye, Michael. Jan and I understand each other. The romance thing is sort of on hold for the time being, but we've remained good friends. Good friends with privileges. Not now, some day. Okay, everybody. Tonight's event is to benefit the Boy Scouts of America. Again. We do that every year. Well, they need our money. They don't have cookies like the Girl Scouts. It'd be nice to do something for people who are actually suffering. Well, Oscar, if you don't like it, then you should concentrate on winning. Because the person at the end of the evening with the highest chip count will receive $500 to donate to the charity of their choice. And they will get a mini-fridge, compliments of Vance Refrigeration. DWIGHT: Yes. So, get your charities in to Pam. I, for example, am playing for Comic Relief. That doesn't exist anymore. Comedy's very much alive, as are homeless people. No, they stopped making that show. Well, then, they need our money more than ever. You have to pick an approved, non-profit organization. There's a great soup kitchen in downtown Scranton. Delicious pea soup on Thursdays. I'll probably give the money to them. Something with animals. Or people. Kobe Bryant has a foundation, and he is so hot. And he gave his wife the biggest diamond ring. I know he didn't do it. Maybe he did it. We are giving money that has been gambled. Why don't we just deal drugs or prostitute ourselves, and donate that money to charity? Oh, and another fun thing. We, at the end of the night, are going to give the check to an actual group of Boy Scouts. Right, Toby? We're gonna Actually, I didn't think it was appropriate to invite children since it's You know, there's gambling and alcohol, and it's in our dangerous warehouse and it's a school night And, you know, Hooters is catering. You know, is that enough? Should I keep going? Why are you the way that you are? Honestly, every time I try to do something fun or exciting, you make it not that way. I hate so much about the things that you choose to be. Okay, you know what? I will not donate my winnings to Comic Relief, since apparently it doesn't exist. I am going to donate to Afghanistanis with AIDS. I think you mean the aid to Afghanistan. No, I mean Afghanistanis with AIDS. Afghani. What? Afghani. That's a dog. No, that's Afghan. That's a shawl. Wait, canine AIDS? No. Humans with AIDS. Who has AIDS? Guys, the Afghanistananies. Okay, you know what? No. No. AIDS is not funny. Believe me, I have tried. There are certain topics that are off-limits to comedians, JFK, AIDS, the Holocaust. The Lincoln Assassination just recently became funny. I need to see this play like I need a hole in the head. And I hope to someday live in a world where a person could tell a hilarious AIDS joke. It's one of my dreams. What are you doing? Oh, nothing. "Till Death Do Us Rock." They're wedding bands. Oh. Roy was supposed to pick the band, but he's concentrating more on the bachelor party now. Wait, wait, where you going? I mean, even if you don't hire a band, you still have to watch the bands. Pam, these are people who have never given up on their dreams. I have great respect for that. And, yes, they're all probably very bad and that will make me feel better about not having dreams. There's a KISS cover band in here. Let's do it. I'm pretty happy these days. I'm getting married soon and I'm getting along with everybody at work. Why did I talk to Jan about transferring? Well, you know. I have no future here. I have already put down the deposit. Do you understand how a deposit works? Mike, I am not having fire-eaters in a paper warehouse. It's Casino Night like Las Vegas. There are fire-eaters all over the place. Except my warehouse. Well, actually, it's my warehouse. Actually, it's owned by Beakman Properties, and Dunder Mifflin is four years into a seven-year lease. Why are you here? When Darryl was coming, you said you wanted me here for protection. Not. I said, not that. We just have a lot of stuff down there that could be stolen. That's ironic. What? That you are afraid. Why? 'Cause I'm from the hood? Dinkin flicka. Dinkin flicka. I taught Mike some phrases to help with his interracial conversations. You know, stuff like, "Fleece it out." "Going mach five." "Dinkin flicka." You know, things us Negroes say. Give me some. (BOTH WHOOPING) Oh, yeah, I taught him a handshake, too. JIM: Wow. I don't know how you're gonna decide. They are all extremely good. I think I should hire them all. Do like Lollapalooza. Yes. Have three stages, yeah. Your mom would love that. She would. Oh, this band is called Scrantonicity. Oh. Let's take a look. Nice. Oh, wait. That's Kevin. On the drums. What? On the drums! On the drums! Oh, my God, that's Kevin! Great song, Kev. Oh, my God, he's the drummer and the singer. We really don't do a lot of weddings. We actually don't play in public very often. We are all really hoping that Pam's wedding works out. This could be a turning point for the band. Wow. Oh! Oh, my Yeah, you haven't seen that since 1983. That is amazing. Okay, we have to sign him. I'm gonna call the label, we're gonna No! No! No, Pam, you're gonna loose him to another wedding. No, come back! No, no, no! Kev! Jim is great.
